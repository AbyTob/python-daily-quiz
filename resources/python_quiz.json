The goal is to measure the execution time of an async function. However, the current implementation does not work as expected.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\ndef time_decorator(func):\n    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()\n        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()\n        print(f\"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@time_decorator\nasync def sample_async_function():\n    await asyncio.sleep(2)\n    return \"Done\"\n\n# Running the function to test\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\nresult = loop.run_until_complete(sample_async_function())\n```\n\nWhat is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed?\n\nA) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  \nB) The decorator works as expected, but the output format is incorrect.  \nC) The decorator should use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):` instead of `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`.  \nD) The decorator should not measure execution time for asynchronous functions.\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nA) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  \nExplanation: The issue with the code lies in how the timing is being recorded. Since `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a function that provides the current time, it should be called directly to get the actual timestamp, not awaited. The correct usage would be `start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` and `end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`. This will give the current event loop's time in seconds when the function starts and ends, allowing the difference to calculate execution time.\n\n[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]",
