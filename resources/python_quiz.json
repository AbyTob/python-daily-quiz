The goal is to measure the execution time of an async function. However, the current implementation does not work as expected.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\ndef time_decorator(func):\n    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()\n        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()\n        print(f\"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@time_decorator\nasync def sample_async_function():\n    await asyncio.sleep(2)\n    return \"Done\"\n\n# Running the function to test\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\nresult = loop.run_until_complete(sample_async_function())\n```\n\nWhat is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed?\n\nA) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  \nB) The decorator works as expected, but the output format is incorrect.  \nC) The decorator should use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):` instead of `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`.  \nD) The decorator should not measure execution time for asynchronous functions.\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nA) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  \nExplanation: The issue with the code lies in how the timing is being recorded. Since `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a function that provides the current time, it should be called directly to get the actual timestamp, not awaited. The correct usage would be `start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` and `end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`. This will give the current event loop's time in seconds when the function starts and ends, allowing the difference to calculate execution time.\n\n[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]",

    "question": "Part 1 (Question): \nImagine you are developing a web application where users can upload files. You want to ensure that only specific types of files (e.g., .txt, .pdf) can be uploaded. To achieve this, you decide to use decorators and metaclasses in Python.\n\nYou create a decorator `@allowed_file_types` that checks if the file type is allowed. Then, you define a metaclass `FileTypeMeta` that automatically applies the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to any class derived from it, setting the allowed types as a parameter.\n\nHere's a code snippet to get you started:\n\n```python\ndef allowed_file_types(*types):\n    def wrapper(cls):\n        cls.allowed_types = types\n        return cls\n    return wrapper\n\nclass FileTypeMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        if 'allowed_types' not in dct:\n            dct['allowed_types'] = ()\n        super_new = super(FileTypeMeta, cls).__new__\n        return super_new(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\nclass AllowedFiles(metaclass=FileTypeMeta):\n    pass\n\nclass TextFile(AllowedFiles):\n    # TODO: Apply the allowed_file_types decorator here\n    pass\n\n# Example usage:\ntxt_file = TextFile()\nprint(txt_file.allowed_types)  # Should print ('.txt',)\n```\n\nWhich of the following ways can you correctly apply the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to the `TextFile` class using the metaclass?\n\nA) Use a direct assignment in the class definition.\nB) Override the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute.\nC) Use a class variable directly within the class definition.\nD) Call the `@allowed_file_types` decorator directly on the class.",
    "answer": "Part 2 (Answer): \nA) Direct assignment is not an option because decorators are applied before the class is fully defined, and direct assignment would occur after the class is created.\n\nB) Correct. By overriding the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute, you can ensure that any subclass of `AllowedFiles` will have its `allowed_types` attribute set by default if not explicitly provided.\n\nC) This would work but doesn't utilize the decorator mechanism and isn't as clean or flexible as using a metaclass.\n\nD) Calling the decorator directly on the class is also not correct because it bypasses the metaclass's influence, which should be used to set the `allowed_types` attribute.",

    "answer": "A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe provided decorator `time_decorator` is synchronous and will measure the total execution time of a synchronous function by capturing the start time before the function call and the end time after the function call. However, it does not account for the case where the function itself might be a coroutine (an asynchronous function). To handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly, you would need to modify the decorator to check if the decorated function is a coroutine using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`. If it is, you should use an asynchronous version of time measurement with `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete`.\n\nA corrected version of the decorator that handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions might look like this:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\nimport inspect\n\ndef time_decorator(func):\n    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):\n        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            start_time = time.time()\n            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)\n            end_time = time.time()\n            print(f\"Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n            return result\n    else:\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            start_time = time.time()\n            result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n            end_time = time.time()\n            print(f\"Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n            return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@time_decorator\nasync def compute_sum(n):\n    return sum(range(n))\n```\n\nThis version of the decorator uses conditional logic to determine whether to measure synchronous or asynchronous functions.",

    "answer": "C) Both \"Task 1\" and \"Task 2\" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.\n\nExplanation: The `Timer` class is designed as an asynchronous context manager, which means it can be used in an async block (`async with`).

The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time after exiting the block and prints it.

However, your script also needs to maintain state across multiple asynchronous tasks without using global variables or mutable shared data structures.\n\nWhich of the following approaches would be most suitable for maintaining state between asynchronous tasks while optimizing I/O operations?\n\nA) Using a class-based state management system that inherits from `asyncio.Lock` and handles all state transitions asynchronously\n\nB) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup\n\nC) Implementing a custom metaclass that tracks state across asynchronous tasks by intercepting attribute access and modification\n\nD) Creating a global dictionary to store state information, which is thread-safe due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\n**B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup**\n\nThis approach is the most suitable for several reasons:\n1. **State Management**: `AsyncExitStack` allows you to manage multiple asynchronous context managers efficiently, ensuring that resources are cleaned up properly even if an exception occurs.\n2. **Concurrency Safety**: By using `asyncio.Queue`, you can safely share state across tasks without worrying about race conditions or synchronization issues, making the system more robust and scalable.\n3. **Asynchronous Operations**: Since both `AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` are asynchronous constructs, they integrate seamlessly with other asynchronous components of your application, improving overall performance and responsiveness.\n\nThe other options have limitations:\n- **Option A** uses `asyncio.Lock`, which is more for synchronization rather than state management.\n- **Option C**, while it might be interesting, introduces unnecessary complexity and potential issues related to maintaining state in a metaclass, especially since metaclasses are not directly designed for this purpose.\n- **Option D** relies on the GIL, which would limit performance gains from asynchronous programming, as it doesn't take advantage of multiple cores or threads effectively.",

    "answer": "**Part 1 (Question):**\n\nConsider the following Python code that aims to create a custom metaclass for logging class instantiation and method calls. However, it contains a critical bug that causes unexpected behavior.\n\n```python\nclass LoggingMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        print(f\"Creating class {name}\")\n        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():\n            if callable(attr_value):\n                setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))\n        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def log_method(method):\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            print(f\"Calling method {method.__name__} with args {args}, kwargs {kwargs}\")\n            return method(*args, **kwargs)\n        return wrapper\n\nclass MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.value += 1\n```\n\nWhich of the following is the correct diagnosis for why `MyClass` instances do not log method calls as expected?\n\nA) The metaclass's `__new__` method is incorrectly overriding the class dictionary.\n\nB) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.\n\nC) Using `setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))` modifies the class dictionary in an unintended way.\n\nD) The `wrapper` function inside `log_method` is incorrectly capturing its arguments.\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nB) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.\n\nThe issue with the provided code is that the `log_method` static method is intended to return a new callable that logs when the wrapped method is called. However, it incorrectly modifies the `wrapper` function's closure by using `*args, **kwargs`, which prevents it from capturing the correct arguments and keyword arguments of the original method.\n\nTo fix this, one should avoid modifying the `wrapper` function in-place within `log_method`. A better approach would be to define a new callable object that captures the original method and its signature correctly. Here is a corrected version of the code:\n\n```python\nclass LoggingMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        print(f\"Creating class {name}\")\n        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():\n            if callable(attr_value):\n                setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))\n        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def log_method(method):\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            print(f\"Calling method {method.__name__} with args {args}, kwargs {kwargs}\")\n            return method(*args, **kwargs)\n        return type(f\"{method.__name__}_wrapper\", (object,), {'__call__': wrapper})()\n\nclass MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.value += 1\n```\n\nThis version of `log_method` returns a callable object that wraps the original method and provides logging functionality without modifying its signature or scope in an unintended way.",

This method returns the number of items in the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which typically includes all non-private attributes of the class (i.e., those not starting with an underscore). Therefore, when `MyClass` is created, the `__len__` method will return 2, as there are two attributes (`a` and `b`) in the `MyClass`.

Each of these methods tries to manage the instance creation, leading to conflicts when an instance is created through one method (metaclass) and later attempted again through another (decorator). The correct approach would be to use either the metaclass or the decorator but not both. If using a metaclass, it should handle all instance creation logic within its `__call__` method. If using a decorator, it should manage instances outside of class definitions and apply it to methods that need to return singleton instances rather than applying it directly to the class.",

    "answer": "A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.\n\n**Explanation:** \nOption A is correct. In Python, decorators are functions that take another function and extend its behavior without explicitly modifying it. The `wrapper` function captures the execution time by recording the start and end times around the call to the original function `func`. This extended behavior is then returned when `compute_sum` is called.\n\n**Option B:**\nWhile the decorator does use a closure, this is not what makes it modify the original function. A closure only affects how variables are bound within nested functions. The modification happens through the way the `wrapper` function is defined and returned by the `timer` decorator.\n\n**Option C:**\nThis statement is incorrect because the `wrapper` function does not replace `compute_sum`. Instead, it wraps around `compute_sum` to add the timing functionality.\n\n**Option D:**\nThe execution time is printed inside the `wrapper` function each time `compute_sum` is called. It is not a one-time print outside of the function call.",

It measures the time taken by the function it decorates (`func`) and prints this duration. However, it does not modify the return value of the function being decorated. Therefore, when `compute_sum(100000)` is called with the `@timing_decorator` applied, it will print the execution time and then return the result of `sum(range(1))`, which is 5000050000, as expected.\n\nThe decorator can be used with coroutine functions without issues. However, in Python, decorators are not directly applicable to coroutines due to differences in how they are executed and awaited, so attempting to use a timing decorator on a coroutine would not raise an error but would likely not function as intended. The decorator's implementation here is straightforward and does not involve complex interactions that could lead to errors with coroutines or cause stack overflows.",

It wraps each method in a lock context manager, which means that only one thread can execute any of the wrapped methods at a time.\n  \n- However, this protection does not extend to other methods like `get_value`. If another method were to access or modify the state without using the lock, it could lead to race conditions even though `increment` is protected.\n\n- In the given code, each thread calls `increment`, which is protected by the lock. Since no other threads can call `increment` at the same time, there will be no data corruption for incrementing the counter. However, calling `get_value` from multiple threads simultaneously could lead to race conditions unless additional synchronization measures are taken.\n\n- Therefore, option B accurately describes that while the `thread_safe` decorator makes `increment` thread-safe, it does not cover all methods in the `Counter` class.",

The goal is to enhance each method's functionality without modifying its implementation.\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef measure_time(cls):\n    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():\n        if callable(value):\n            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))\n    return cls\n\ndef _time_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start = time.time()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end = time.time()\n        print(f\"Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@measure_time\nclass ExampleClass:\n    def method1(self):\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n\n    def method2(self):\n        time.sleep(1)\n```\n\n**Question:** What is the issue with this implementation of the `measure_time` decorator, and how might you fix it to ensure that the original method behavior remains intact?\n\nA) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.\n\nB) The decorator modifies the class in-place which could cause issues if multiple instances are created.\n\nC) The `wrapper` function is not capturing the correct reference of the original method.\n\nD) The `measure_time` decorator should be a metaclass instead of a class decorator to avoid modifying the class directly.",
    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.\n\n**Explanation:** The current implementation assumes that all attributes in the class dictionary are callable methods, but it fails to distinguish between static methods and instance methods. When a method is called on an instance, Python first checks if it exists in the instance's `__dict__`, then in its class. Since the decorator replaces all callables with wrappers, it mistakenly tries to wrap static methods as well, leading to errors.\n\nTo fix this, you need to ensure that only instance methods are wrapped. Here is a corrected version of the `measure_time` decorator:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef measure_time(cls):\n    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():\n        if callable(value) and not isinstance(value, staticmethod):\n            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))\n    return cls\n\ndef _time_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        start = time.time()\n        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)\n        end = time.time()\n        print(f\"Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@measure_time\nclass ExampleClass:\n    def method1(self):\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def method2():\n        time.sleep(1)\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the decorator checks if the callable is not a staticmethod using `isinstance(value, staticmethod)` before wrapping it, ensuring that only instance methods are modified.",

You decide to use Python's asyncio library for handling async tasks and a custom metaclass to enhance class behavior dynamically.\n\n1. Create an `AsyncHandler` metaclass that automatically converts any method in the class decorated with `@async_method` into an asynchronous coroutine using asyncio.\n2. Implement a class `RequestProcessor` that uses this metaclass and includes methods `fetch_data` (synchronous) and `update_cache` (asynchronous).

If it is, the attribute is replaced with a property that allows getting and setting the value. However, if an attribute's value is not an integer or float (e.g., a string in this case), it will remain unchanged as an instance variable.

    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n\n**Answer:** B) The output will be \"INFO: Starting\", \"INFO: Processing\", \"INFO: Ending\" in that specific order.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe given code uses `asyncio.gather` to concurrently run multiple tasks, each of which logs a message. Since all tasks are awaited within the `main` function, they will execute in sequence because `asyncio.gather` schedules them to run as soon as possible but does not guarantee their order if there is any overlap.\n\nTo ensure that `logger` is not garbage collected before all logging tasks complete, we need to keep a reference to it. In Python, an object is considered garbage collectible only when there are no more references pointing to it. By keeping the `logger` variable in scope until after all tasks have completed, it ensures that it remains alive long enough for the garbage collector to determine if it can be freed.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nclass AsyncLogger:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    \n    async def log(self, message):\n        print(f\"{self.name}: {message}\")\n\nasync def main():\n    logger = AsyncLogger(\"INFO\")\n    await asyncio.gather(\n        logger.log(\"Starting\"),\n        logger.log(\"Processing\"),\n        logger.log(\"Ending\")\n    )\n    del logger  # Explicitly deleting the reference to allow garbage collection\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the `logger` variable is explicitly deleted after all tasks have completed. This ensures that `logger` can be garbage collected if no other references to it exist. However, in practical scenarios, you generally don’t need to explicitly delete variables as Python’s garbage collector handles most cases automatically.",

    "answer": "A) Coroutine started  \n   Decorated coroutine started  \n   Coroutine finished  \n   Decorated coroutine finished  \n\n**Explanation:** The `CoroutineDecorator` class is designed to be a decorator for asynchronous functions. When `my_decorated_coroutine` is called, it first runs the undecorated `my_coroutine`, and then proceeds with its own logic. Since `asyncio.run()` is used inside the decorator to execute the decorated coroutine, both the original and decorated coroutine methods are executed within the same event loop run by `asyncio.run()`. This results in the outputs being interleaved as shown in option A.",

    "answer": "B) Create a separate `AsyncTimer` class that inherits from `Timer` but overrides the context management protocol for async contexts.\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is option B. To make the existing `Timer` class work with asynchronous functions, we need to create an `AsyncTimer` class that overrides the context management protocol specifically for use in asynchronous code. This involves implementing methods like `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` instead of the standard `__enter__` and `__exit__`. The existing `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods should be preserved for synchronous use, as they will still work with non-async contexts. By creating a subclass specifically for async usage, we maintain compatibility with both synchronous and asynchronous code without modifying the original class's behavior.",
