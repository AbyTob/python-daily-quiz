The goal is to measure the execution time of an async function. However, the current implementation does not work as expected.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\ndef time_decorator(func):\n    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()\n        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()\n        print(f\"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@time_decorator\nasync def sample_async_function():\n    await asyncio.sleep(2)\n    return \"Done\"\n\n# Running the function to test\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\nresult = loop.run_until_complete(sample_async_function())\n```\n\nWhat is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed?\n\nA) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  \nB) The decorator works as expected, but the output format is incorrect.  \nC) The decorator should use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):` instead of `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`.  \nD) The decorator should not measure execution time for asynchronous functions.\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nA) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  \nExplanation: The issue with the code lies in how the timing is being recorded. Since `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a function that provides the current time, it should be called directly to get the actual timestamp, not awaited. The correct usage would be `start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` and `end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`. This will give the current event loop's time in seconds when the function starts and ends, allowing the difference to calculate execution time.\n\n[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]",

    "question": "Part 1 (Question): \nImagine you are developing a web application where users can upload files. You want to ensure that only specific types of files (e.g., .txt, .pdf) can be uploaded. To achieve this, you decide to use decorators and metaclasses in Python.\n\nYou create a decorator `@allowed_file_types` that checks if the file type is allowed. Then, you define a metaclass `FileTypeMeta` that automatically applies the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to any class derived from it, setting the allowed types as a parameter.\n\nHere's a code snippet to get you started:\n\n```python\ndef allowed_file_types(*types):\n    def wrapper(cls):\n        cls.allowed_types = types\n        return cls\n    return wrapper\n\nclass FileTypeMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        if 'allowed_types' not in dct:\n            dct['allowed_types'] = ()\n        super_new = super(FileTypeMeta, cls).__new__\n        return super_new(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\nclass AllowedFiles(metaclass=FileTypeMeta):\n    pass\n\nclass TextFile(AllowedFiles):\n    # TODO: Apply the allowed_file_types decorator here\n    pass\n\n# Example usage:\ntxt_file = TextFile()\nprint(txt_file.allowed_types)  # Should print ('.txt',)\n```\n\nWhich of the following ways can you correctly apply the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to the `TextFile` class using the metaclass?\n\nA) Use a direct assignment in the class definition.\nB) Override the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute.\nC) Use a class variable directly within the class definition.\nD) Call the `@allowed_file_types` decorator directly on the class.",
    "answer": "Part 2 (Answer): \nA) Direct assignment is not an option because decorators are applied before the class is fully defined, and direct assignment would occur after the class is created.\n\nB) Correct. By overriding the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute, you can ensure that any subclass of `AllowedFiles` will have its `allowed_types` attribute set by default if not explicitly provided.\n\nC) This would work but doesn't utilize the decorator mechanism and isn't as clean or flexible as using a metaclass.\n\nD) Calling the decorator directly on the class is also not correct because it bypasses the metaclass's influence, which should be used to set the `allowed_types` attribute.",

    "answer": "A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe provided decorator `time_decorator` is synchronous and will measure the total execution time of a synchronous function by capturing the start time before the function call and the end time after the function call. However, it does not account for the case where the function itself might be a coroutine (an asynchronous function). To handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly, you would need to modify the decorator to check if the decorated function is a coroutine using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`. If it is, you should use an asynchronous version of time measurement with `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete`.\n\nA corrected version of the decorator that handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions might look like this:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\nimport inspect\n\ndef time_decorator(func):\n    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):\n        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            start_time = time.time()\n            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)\n            end_time = time.time()\n            print(f\"Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n            return result\n    else:\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            start_time = time.time()\n            result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n            end_time = time.time()\n            print(f\"Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n            return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@time_decorator\nasync def compute_sum(n):\n    return sum(range(n))\n```\n\nThis version of the decorator uses conditional logic to determine whether to measure synchronous or asynchronous functions.",

    "answer": "C) Both \"Task 1\" and \"Task 2\" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.\n\nExplanation: The `Timer` class is designed as an asynchronous context manager, which means it can be used in an async block (`async with`).

The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time after exiting the block and prints it.

However, your script also needs to maintain state across multiple asynchronous tasks without using global variables or mutable shared data structures.\n\nWhich of the following approaches would be most suitable for maintaining state between asynchronous tasks while optimizing I/O operations?\n\nA) Using a class-based state management system that inherits from `asyncio.Lock` and handles all state transitions asynchronously\n\nB) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup\n\nC) Implementing a custom metaclass that tracks state across asynchronous tasks by intercepting attribute access and modification\n\nD) Creating a global dictionary to store state information, which is thread-safe due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\n**B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup**\n\nThis approach is the most suitable for several reasons:\n1. **State Management**: `AsyncExitStack` allows you to manage multiple asynchronous context managers efficiently, ensuring that resources are cleaned up properly even if an exception occurs.\n2. **Concurrency Safety**: By using `asyncio.Queue`, you can safely share state across tasks without worrying about race conditions or synchronization issues, making the system more robust and scalable.\n3. **Asynchronous Operations**: Since both `AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` are asynchronous constructs, they integrate seamlessly with other asynchronous components of your application, improving overall performance and responsiveness.\n\nThe other options have limitations:\n- **Option A** uses `asyncio.Lock`, which is more for synchronization rather than state management.\n- **Option C**, while it might be interesting, introduces unnecessary complexity and potential issues related to maintaining state in a metaclass, especially since metaclasses are not directly designed for this purpose.\n- **Option D** relies on the GIL, which would limit performance gains from asynchronous programming, as it doesn't take advantage of multiple cores or threads effectively.",

    "answer": "**Part 1 (Question):**\n\nConsider the following Python code that aims to create a custom metaclass for logging class instantiation and method calls. However, it contains a critical bug that causes unexpected behavior.\n\n```python\nclass LoggingMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        print(f\"Creating class {name}\")\n        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():\n            if callable(attr_value):\n                setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))\n        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def log_method(method):\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            print(f\"Calling method {method.__name__} with args {args}, kwargs {kwargs}\")\n            return method(*args, **kwargs)\n        return wrapper\n\nclass MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.value += 1\n```\n\nWhich of the following is the correct diagnosis for why `MyClass` instances do not log method calls as expected?\n\nA) The metaclass's `__new__` method is incorrectly overriding the class dictionary.\n\nB) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.\n\nC) Using `setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))` modifies the class dictionary in an unintended way.\n\nD) The `wrapper` function inside `log_method` is incorrectly capturing its arguments.\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nB) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.\n\nThe issue with the provided code is that the `log_method` static method is intended to return a new callable that logs when the wrapped method is called. However, it incorrectly modifies the `wrapper` function's closure by using `*args, **kwargs`, which prevents it from capturing the correct arguments and keyword arguments of the original method.\n\nTo fix this, one should avoid modifying the `wrapper` function in-place within `log_method`. A better approach would be to define a new callable object that captures the original method and its signature correctly. Here is a corrected version of the code:\n\n```python\nclass LoggingMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        print(f\"Creating class {name}\")\n        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():\n            if callable(attr_value):\n                setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))\n        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def log_method(method):\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            print(f\"Calling method {method.__name__} with args {args}, kwargs {kwargs}\")\n            return method(*args, **kwargs)\n        return type(f\"{method.__name__}_wrapper\", (object,), {'__call__': wrapper})()\n\nclass MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.value += 1\n```\n\nThis version of `log_method` returns a callable object that wraps the original method and provides logging functionality without modifying its signature or scope in an unintended way.",

This method returns the number of items in the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which typically includes all non-private attributes of the class (i.e., those not starting with an underscore). Therefore, when `MyClass` is created, the `__len__` method will return 2, as there are two attributes (`a` and `b`) in the `MyClass`.

Each of these methods tries to manage the instance creation, leading to conflicts when an instance is created through one method (metaclass) and later attempted again through another (decorator). The correct approach would be to use either the metaclass or the decorator but not both. If using a metaclass, it should handle all instance creation logic within its `__call__` method. If using a decorator, it should manage instances outside of class definitions and apply it to methods that need to return singleton instances rather than applying it directly to the class.",

    "answer": "A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.\n\n**Explanation:** \nOption A is correct. In Python, decorators are functions that take another function and extend its behavior without explicitly modifying it. The `wrapper` function captures the execution time by recording the start and end times around the call to the original function `func`. This extended behavior is then returned when `compute_sum` is called.\n\n**Option B:**\nWhile the decorator does use a closure, this is not what makes it modify the original function. A closure only affects how variables are bound within nested functions. The modification happens through the way the `wrapper` function is defined and returned by the `timer` decorator.\n\n**Option C:**\nThis statement is incorrect because the `wrapper` function does not replace `compute_sum`. Instead, it wraps around `compute_sum` to add the timing functionality.\n\n**Option D:**\nThe execution time is printed inside the `wrapper` function each time `compute_sum` is called. It is not a one-time print outside of the function call.",

It measures the time taken by the function it decorates (`func`) and prints this duration. However, it does not modify the return value of the function being decorated. Therefore, when `compute_sum(100000)` is called with the `@timing_decorator` applied, it will print the execution time and then return the result of `sum(range(1))`, which is 5000050000, as expected.\n\nThe decorator can be used with coroutine functions without issues. However, in Python, decorators are not directly applicable to coroutines due to differences in how they are executed and awaited, so attempting to use a timing decorator on a coroutine would not raise an error but would likely not function as intended. The decorator's implementation here is straightforward and does not involve complex interactions that could lead to errors with coroutines or cause stack overflows.",

It wraps each method in a lock context manager, which means that only one thread can execute any of the wrapped methods at a time.\n  \n- However, this protection does not extend to other methods like `get_value`. If another method were to access or modify the state without using the lock, it could lead to race conditions even though `increment` is protected.\n\n- In the given code, each thread calls `increment`, which is protected by the lock. Since no other threads can call `increment` at the same time, there will be no data corruption for incrementing the counter. However, calling `get_value` from multiple threads simultaneously could lead to race conditions unless additional synchronization measures are taken.\n\n- Therefore, option B accurately describes that while the `thread_safe` decorator makes `increment` thread-safe, it does not cover all methods in the `Counter` class.",

The goal is to enhance each method's functionality without modifying its implementation.\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef measure_time(cls):\n    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():\n        if callable(value):\n            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))\n    return cls\n\ndef _time_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start = time.time()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end = time.time()\n        print(f\"Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@measure_time\nclass ExampleClass:\n    def method1(self):\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n\n    def method2(self):\n        time.sleep(1)\n```\n\n**Question:** What is the issue with this implementation of the `measure_time` decorator, and how might you fix it to ensure that the original method behavior remains intact?\n\nA) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.\n\nB) The decorator modifies the class in-place which could cause issues if multiple instances are created.\n\nC) The `wrapper` function is not capturing the correct reference of the original method.\n\nD) The `measure_time` decorator should be a metaclass instead of a class decorator to avoid modifying the class directly.",
    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.\n\n**Explanation:** The current implementation assumes that all attributes in the class dictionary are callable methods, but it fails to distinguish between static methods and instance methods. When a method is called on an instance, Python first checks if it exists in the instance's `__dict__`, then in its class. Since the decorator replaces all callables with wrappers, it mistakenly tries to wrap static methods as well, leading to errors.\n\nTo fix this, you need to ensure that only instance methods are wrapped. Here is a corrected version of the `measure_time` decorator:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef measure_time(cls):\n    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():\n        if callable(value) and not isinstance(value, staticmethod):\n            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))\n    return cls\n\ndef _time_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        start = time.time()\n        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)\n        end = time.time()\n        print(f\"Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@measure_time\nclass ExampleClass:\n    def method1(self):\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def method2():\n        time.sleep(1)\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the decorator checks if the callable is not a staticmethod using `isinstance(value, staticmethod)` before wrapping it, ensuring that only instance methods are modified.",

You decide to use Python's asyncio library for handling async tasks and a custom metaclass to enhance class behavior dynamically.\n\n1. Create an `AsyncHandler` metaclass that automatically converts any method in the class decorated with `@async_method` into an asynchronous coroutine using asyncio.\n2. Implement a class `RequestProcessor` that uses this metaclass and includes methods `fetch_data` (synchronous) and `update_cache` (asynchronous).

    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n\n**Answer:** B) The output will be \"INFO: Starting\", \"INFO: Processing\", \"INFO: Ending\" in that specific order.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe given code uses `asyncio.gather` to concurrently run multiple tasks, each of which logs a message. Since all tasks are awaited within the `main` function, they will execute in sequence because `asyncio.gather` schedules them to run as soon as possible but does not guarantee their order if there is any overlap.\n\nTo ensure that `logger` is not garbage collected before all logging tasks complete, we need to keep a reference to it. In Python, an object is considered garbage collectible only when there are no more references pointing to it. By keeping the `logger` variable in scope until after all tasks have completed, it ensures that it remains alive long enough for the garbage collector to determine if it can be freed.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nclass AsyncLogger:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    \n    async def log(self, message):\n        print(f\"{self.name}: {message}\")\n\nasync def main():\n    logger = AsyncLogger(\"INFO\")\n    await asyncio.gather(\n        logger.log(\"Starting\"),\n        logger.log(\"Processing\"),\n        logger.log(\"Ending\")\n    )\n    del logger  # Explicitly deleting the reference to allow garbage collection\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the `logger` variable is explicitly deleted after all tasks have completed. This ensures that `logger` can be garbage collected if no other references to it exist. However, in practical scenarios, you generally don’t need to explicitly delete variables as Python’s garbage collector handles most cases automatically.",

    "answer": "B) Create a separate `AsyncTimer` class that inherits from `Timer` but overrides the context management protocol for async contexts.\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is option B. To make the existing `Timer` class work with asynchronous functions, we need to create an `AsyncTimer` class that overrides the context management protocol specifically for use in asynchronous code. This involves implementing methods like `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` instead of the standard `__enter__` and `__exit__`. The existing `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods should be preserved for synchronous use, as they will still work with non-async contexts.

Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method  \nD) An error will occur because `my_decorator` cannot be applied to methods in Python 3\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nThe correct answer is C) Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method.\n\nExplanation: In Python 3, decorators can indeed be applied to instance methods within a class using metaclasses or by directly applying decorators at method definition. Here's how it works:\n\n- When you apply `@my_decorator` above the method `my_method`, it wraps the method with another function that adds some pre and post-execution behavior.\n- The `__metaclass__ = type` in the class declaration is necessary because, starting from Python 3, classes are first-class objects and need a metaclass to be properly instantiated. If you omit this line, Python will raise an error because it cannot instantiate a class without a valid metaclass.\n\nTherefore, when you create an instance `obj` of `MyClass` and call `obj.my_method()`, the output will be as follows:\n1. The pre-function call message is printed.\n2. The method's code runs, printing \"Hello from my_method\".\n3. The post-function call message is printed.\n\nThis demonstrates that decorators can indeed modify class methods in Python 3, even when using metaclasses for class instantiation.",

This means that when `slow_task` is called, it first waits for 2 seconds (due to the decorator), and then proceeds with its original execution.

Then, after another second (total of 3 seconds), \"Main function completed\"\n\nSo, option A is the correct answer as it matches the described behavior.",

    "answer": "[A] The decorator correctly measures and prints the execution time of `my_function`.\n\n**Explanation:** This statement is incorrect. While the decorator does correctly measure the time taken by the function, it incorrectly calculates the total time as the sum of the start and end times instead of their difference. As a result, the output will be `Function my_function took 0.0 seconds to execute.` because `end_time - start_time` is not being computed properly.\n\n[B] There's a mistake in the decorator that prevents it from working as intended.\n\n**Explanation:** This statement is correct. The error lies in how the timing calculation is performed. It should be `end_time - start_time`, not `start_time + end_time`. This small mistake will result in incorrect timing values being printed.\n\n[C] Using decorators for timing can significantly impact the performance of decorated functions due to the overhead introduced.\n\n**Explanation:** This statement is correct. Decorators add a layer of indirection, which introduces some overhead. While the impact might not be noticeable for very short functions, it could become significant when applied to performance-critical code.\n\n[D] All functions decorated with `@timer` will have their execution time printed when called.\n\n**Explanation:** This statement is correct. The decorator `timer` is correctly defined and applied to `my_function`, so when `my_function()` is called, its execution time will be printed.",

The correct answer highlights that the `SingletonMeta` metaclass overrides the `__call__` method to control the instantiation process, ensuring that each time an instance of `Database` is created, the same pre-existing instance is returned, thus making `db1` and `db2` the same object.",

First and foremost, it does not account for any arguments that might be passed to the decorated function.

Additionally, the decorator should ideally handle functions with parameters gracefully by accepting *args and **kwargs so that it can forward these to the actual function call.

    "answer": "[ANSWER] D) The cache will only store results for unique sequences of recursive calls that lead to different outcomes.\n\n**Explanation**: The `cache_results` decorator is designed to cache the results of function calls based on their arguments. In this case, it caches the results of the Fibonacci sequence calculations. When a call to `fibonacci(n)` is made, the decorator first checks if the result for those arguments is already in the cache. If not, it computes the result using the function (in this case, the Fibonacci calculation), stores it in the cache, and then returns the result. For recursive functions like `fibonacci`, different sequences of calls to reach the same base case will produce different results, leading to unique keys in the cache.

    "answer": "D) The metaclass is used to dynamically add a method to all classes in the application.\n\nExplanation: In Python, a metaclass is a class that creates and controls other classes. When you define a class with `metaclass=AddMethodMeta`, every instance of that class will have a new method called `new_method`. This is true regardless of whether other classes use the same metaclass or not. The `MyClass` defined in this example is an exception to this rule, as it does not explicitly declare `new_method`, but instances of any class using `AddMethodMeta` will have access to it. Option A is incorrect because only classes explicitly decorated with `AddMethodMeta` will get the new method. Options B and C are incorrect because calling `obj.new_method()` on an instance of a class that does not use `AddMethodMeta` would raise an AttributeError, but since `MyClass` is an exception to this rule, it would not be the case here.",

    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n\n**Correct Answer: B**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe code uses threading to create multiple threads that increment the shared `counter` object. Each thread performs 1000 increments on the counter. The critical section in the `increment` method is protected by a lock, which means that at any given time, only one thread can execute the code within this section.\n\nHowever, there are race conditions present in the code. Even though each increment operation is atomic (i.e., it cannot be interrupted), multiple threads can still see and modify `_value` concurrently before their changes are fully written back to memory. This can lead to situations where two or more threads read the same value for `_value`, both increment it, and then write back their incremented values, resulting in a net increase of less than 1000 increments.\n\nTherefore, while the lock ensures that individual increment operations are thread-safe, the overall operation is still subject to race conditions when multiple threads attempt to modify the shared counter concurrently. This means that the final value printed by the program may be less than 10000, making option B correct.",

The metaclass dynamically renames each attribute by prefixing it with an underscore and creating a property that accesses this new private attribute.\n\nIn the `MyClass`, an attribute named `__value` is defined, but due to the metaclass's behavior, there will be no direct access to this attribute from outside the class. Instead, a property named `value` should be created by the metaclass. However, in the provided code, there is no method to handle this transformation correctly.\n\nWhen you attempt to access `obj.value`, Python looks for an attribute or property with that name on `MyClass`. Since no such property exists due to the incorrect implementation of the metaclass, it raises an `AttributeError`.\n\nThe correct behavior would require adding a method in the metaclass to dynamically create and assign properties for each original attribute.",

In this case, the lock prevents multiple threads from entering the `with` block at the same time, ensuring that the data modification is thread-safe.\n\nThe `ThreadSafeSingleton` class itself uses a dictionary (`data`) to store data, and the `add_data_to_singleton` function demonstrates how to use the singleton instance within a context manager. The lock ensures that when the 'temp' key is added, it does not interfere with any other thread attempting to access or modify the same key concurrently.\n\nTherefore, after executing the script, the size of the data dictionary will be `1`, indicating that one item has been successfully added through the context manager while maintaining thread safety.",

    "answer": "**Part 1 (Question):**\n\nImagine you are tasked with creating a system for managing user sessions in an asynchronous web application. You want to ensure that each session has a timeout mechanism, and any session that exceeds this time limit should automatically expire. \n\nYou decide to implement this using Python's `asyncio` library. However, you also want to make sure that the session management logic is easily reusable across different parts of your application without duplicating code.\n\nTo achieve this, you consider creating a decorator for sessions that automatically handles the timeout. You then create a metaclass that applies this decorator to any class that represents a session.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\ndef session_timeout(timeout):\n    def decorator(cls):\n        async def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n            task = loop.create_task(self.__aenter__(*args, **kwargs))\n            try:\n                result = await asyncio.wait_for(task, timeout=timeout)\n                return result\n            except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n                task.cancel()\n                raise Exception(\"Session timed out\")\n        cls.__aenter__ = wrapper\n        return cls\n    return decorator\n\nclass SessionMeta(type):\n    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, dct):\n        if 'session_timeout' in dct:\n            dct['session_timeout'] = session_timeout(dct['session_timeout'])\n        return super().__new__(mcls, name, bases, dct)\n\nclass AsyncSession(metaclass=SessionMeta):\n    async def __aenter__(self):\n        pass\n\n    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):\n        pass\n\n# Example usage\nclass UserSession(AsyncSession):\n    session_timeout = 30  # Timeout in seconds\n\nasync def main():\n    async with UserSession() as session:\n        # Simulate work within the session\n        await asyncio.sleep(25)\n        print(\"Session is still active\")\n\n# Run the example\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn this implementation, `session_timeout` is a decorator that adds a timeout mechanism to any class decorated with it. The `SessionMeta` metaclass applies this decorator to any class that has a `session_timeout` attribute.\n\n**Question:** What will happen if an instance of `UserSession` is used without waiting for the session to expire, and how does the `AsyncSession` class structure support this functionality?\n\nA) The session will remain active indefinitely.\nB) The session will expire after 30 seconds due to the timeout mechanism.\nC) An exception will be raised because no timeout was specified.\nD) The session will raise an error when trying to access its methods.\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nB) The session will expire after 30 seconds due to the timeout mechanism.\n\nExplanation:\nThe `AsyncSession` class uses a metaclass (`SessionMeta`) that applies a decorator (`session_timeout`) to any class it decorates. In this case, `UserSession` has a `session_timeout` attribute set to 30 seconds. When an instance of `UserSession` is used in an asynchronous context manager (i.e., within the `async with` statement), the `__aenter__` method decorated by `@session_timeout(30)` will be invoked. This method runs the session's entry logic and then waits for it to complete, timing out after 30 seconds if it has not already finished. If the session completes within the timeout period, the result is returned; otherwise, an exception is raised indicating that the session timed out.\n\nThe `AsyncSession` class structure supports this functionality by defining abstract methods (`__aenter__` and `__aexit__`) for entering and exiting the session context, respectively. These methods can be overridden in subclasses to provide specific behavior when a session begins or ends. The metaclass ensures that any subclass of `AsyncSession` will have its timeout mechanism applied automatically if it includes a `session_timeout` attribute.",

    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n\n**Correct Answer:** B\n\n**Explanation:** The code uses a metaclass (`Meta`) to automatically decorate all callable attributes of the class it creates with the `log_decorator`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created using the context manager, the `__init__` method is not explicitly defined in the class. Since Python's default behavior for creating instances involves calling `__new__` and then `__init__`, but there's no explicit `__init__`, the metaclass does not add a logging decorator to it.\n\nTherefore, when `obj.method1()` and `obj.method2(3, 4)` are called inside the context manager block:\n- The `method1` is decorated with `log_decorator`, so it logs its call before executing.\n- The `method2` is also decorated with `log_decorator`, logging its call before executing.\n\nThis results in the output:\n\n```\nCalling method1 with args: (), kwargs: {}\nExecuting method1\nCalling method2 with args: (3,), kwargs: {'b': 4}\nExecuting method2 with 3 and 4\n```",

Since each task sleeps for a time equal to its index, the total execution time will be dominated by the longest-running task (the one with the highest index). Therefore, the total execution time will be close to 4 seconds (since task 4 takes the most time).",

When a new class is defined, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called with the class name, its base classes, and a dictionary of attributes. The code in the question demonstrates that the metaclass adds a method to all classes derived from it.\n\nIn this case, when `Derived` inherits from `Base`, the `Meta.__new__` method is invoked for both `Base` and `Derived`. This means that `new_method` is added not just to `Derived` but also to any class that inherits from `Base`. Therefore, when an instance of `Derived` or any other subclass of `Base` is created, it will have access to the `new_method`.\n\nThis example shows how metaclasses can be used to add functionality across all subclasses dynamically, making them a powerful tool for advanced Python development.",

The decorator adds a small cost by recording and calculating the time before and after the function call.\n\n**B) The execution time of `compute_sum` is measured in milliseconds.**\n\n**Explanation:** This statement is incorrect because the `time.time()` function returns the current time in seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970).

    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n**Correct Answer:** C\n\n**Detailed Explanation:** \n- **Statement A is incorrect**: While `fetch_data` is defined with `async def`, it does not execute asynchronously unless called within an asynchronous context. The coroutine nature of `fetch_data` means it can pause execution at the `await asyncio.sleep(2)` line, but it won't run until scheduled in an event loop.\n- **Statement B is incorrect**: Asynchronous operations like calling a coroutine (e.g., `fetch_data()`) will not execute concurrently within a single thread unless explicitly managed using features like `asyncio.create_task` or scheduling them in different tasks. In the given code, `await fetch_data()` and `await logger.log(data)` are sequential, not concurrent.\n- **Statement C is correct**: The `AsyncLogger` class correctly implements asynchronous context management by defining the methods `__aenter__`, `log`, and `__aexit__`. This allows the class to manage resources asynchronously when used with `async with`.\n- **Statement D is incorrect**: The value of `result` will be the data returned by `fetch_data()`, which is \"Data fetched\". Therefore, `result` will not contain \"Processed result: Data fetched\"; it will simply contain \"Data fetched\".\n\nThis question tests the understanding of asynchronous programming in Python, specifically the use of coroutines and context managers for resource management.",

    "answer": "### Answer:\nA) The `cache` dictionary is not thread-safe and could lead to race conditions.\n\n**Explanation:** In this implementation, the caching mechanism uses a simple dictionary without any synchronization mechanisms. If multiple asynchronous operations are performed concurrently and access the cache simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions where two or more tasks might attempt to write to or read from the same key in the cache at the same time. This could result in incorrect data being returned or other unexpected behavior.\n\n**Correct Fix:** To resolve this issue, you should use a thread-safe caching mechanism such as `threading.Lock` for synchronous code or `asyncio.Lock` for asynchronous code to ensure that only one task can access the cache at a time. Here is an example of how you might modify the caching mechanism using `asyncio.Lock`:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nclass CacheMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        cache = {}\n        lock = asyncio.Lock()\n        original_method = dct.get('fetch_data')\n\n        if original_method:\n            async def cached_method(*args, **kwargs):\n                key = args + tuple(kwargs.items())\n                async with lock:\n                    if key not in cache:\n                        cache[key] = await original_method(*args, **kwargs)\n                    return cache[key]\n            \n            dct['fetch_data'] = cached_method\n\n        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\nclass DataFetcher(metaclass=CacheMeta):\n    async def fetch_data(self, url):\n        # Simulate an HTTP request\n        await asyncio.sleep(1)\n        return f\"Data from {url}\"\n\n# Usage\nasync def main():\n    fetcher = DataFetcher()\n    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(\"http://example.com\"))\n    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(\"http://example.com\"))  # This should be fetched from cache\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nBy using `async with lock`, you ensure that only one task can execute the critical section of code (i.e., accessing or updating the cache) at a time, thus preventing race conditions and ensuring that the caching mechanism works correctly under concurrent access.",

    "answer": "B) Modify the `timer` decorator to ensure it handles functions without arguments gracefully.\n\nExplanation: The current implementation of the `timer` decorator assumes that there will always be at least one argument (`func`) passed to it. If a function decorated with `@timer` does not accept any arguments, calling this function will result in a TypeError because the wrapper will not receive any positional or keyword arguments other than those intended for the wrapped function itself.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure that our decorator can handle functions without arguments correctly. One way to do this is by modifying the `timer` decorator to check if `args` and `kwargs` are empty within the wrapper function and adjust its behavior accordingly. For example:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef timer(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = time.time()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = time.time()\n        print(f\"{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@timer\ndef compute_sum(n=1000):  # Added default argument to make the function callable without arguments\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        total += i\n    return total\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that the `compute_sum` function can be called with or without an argument, and the `timer` decorator will still work correctly.",

This instance is then invoked with `my_function()` as its argument. The `__call__` method of `MyDecorator` is what gets executed when the decorated function is called. It first prints \"Before function call\", then executes the original function, and finally prints \"After function call\".

This allows the coroutine `print_time` to be executed repeatedly at fixed intervals, printing the current time each time. Therefore, statement A accurately describes the behavior of the code.",

    "answer": "C) The `cache` dictionary is being created inside the decorator, leading to each decorated function having its own separate cache. This can be corrected by moving the `cache` outside the decorator.\n\nThe issue with the current implementation is that the `cache` dictionary is recreated every time the `memoize` decorator is applied to a function, resulting in each function having its own independent cache. This not only increases memory usage but also makes the memoization mechanism less effective because it does not share cached results between different instances of decorated functions.\n\nTo correct this, we need to move the `cache` dictionary outside the decorator so that it is shared across all decorated functions:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ncache = {}\n\ndef memoize(func):\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args):\n        if args in cache:\n            return cache[args]\n        else:\n            result = func(*args)\n            cache[args] = result\n            return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@memoize\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return n\n    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n```\n\nWith this change, the `cache` dictionary is shared across all instances of decorated functions, and memoization will work correctly for the `fibonacci` function.",

    "answer": "**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nA) All tasks will start immediately upon calling `asyncio.gather` and complete concurrently.\n\nExplanation:\n- In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This means that even though asyncio allows for concurrent execution of I/O-bound tasks, CPU-bound tasks are still subject to the GIL.\n- When using `asyncio.gather`, all tasks are scheduled concurrently by asyncio's event loop. The tasks start immediately upon being passed to `asyncio.gather`.\n- Each task runs in parallel as long as it is waiting for I/O operations (like `await asyncio.sleep(delay)`). Since these tasks involve sleeping, they do not block the event loop, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.\n- Therefore, all tasks will start immediately and complete concurrently, with each waiting for its specified delay.

Modify the `SingletonMeta` metaclass accordingly.\n\nA. Use `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method.\nB. Replace the `_instances` dictionary with an `OrderedDict`.\nC. Use a context manager for the lock.\nD. Implement `__new__` instead of `__call__`.",
    "answer": "**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nA. Use `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method.\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is to use a `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method of the metaclass to ensure that instance creation is thread-safe. This approach involves creating an instance only if it does not already exist, and locking during this process to prevent multiple threads from creating different instances simultaneously. Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\nclass SingletonMeta(type):\n    _instances = {}\n    _lock = threading.Lock()\n    \n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n        with cls._lock:\n            if cls not in cls._instances:\n                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)\n                cls._instances[cls] = instance\n        return cls._instances[cls]\n\nclass Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):\n    def connect(self):\n        print(\"Connecting to database...\")\n\n# Usage\ndb1 = Database()\ndb2 = Database()\n\nprint(db1 is db2)  # Output: True\n```\n\nIn this solution, the `_lock` attribute of the metaclass ensures that only one thread can enter the `if cls not in cls._instances` block at a time, thus guaranteeing that the singleton property is maintained even when accessed from multiple threads.",

However, a potential issue with this approach is that it does not handle exceptions that might be raised during the execution of the decorated function. If an exception occurs inside the decorated function, the decorator will catch it and print a message indicating the time taken to execute (which would be 0 since no time has passed), but the original exception will be lost.

Since `Greeter` and `FriendlyGreeter` do not have a `greet` method, they would raise a `TypeError`. However, due to the decorator `@greet_decorator`, `Greeter` gets an additional `greet` method that prints \"Greetings!\" before calling the original `greet` method.\n- The `WelcomeGreeter` class uses both the metaclass and the decorator. When `WelcomeGreeter` is instantiated, the `Meta` metaclass checks for the presence of a `greet` method, which does not exist in this case. Therefore, it raises a `TypeError`.\n- Since the metaclass check fails before the decorator can be applied to `WelcomeGreeter`, option B and C cannot be correct.\n- Option A is incorrect because all classes have the `greet` method due to the decorator.",

Modify the existing code to incorporate this new metaclass in a way that it seamlessly integrates with the `SingletonMeta` and respects the singleton pattern.",
    "answer": "**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\nExplanation: The task requires creating a metaclass that combines the functionality of both `SingletonMeta` and `LoggingMeta`. To achieve this, we need to ensure that the new metaclass inherits from both metaclasses. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass SingletonMeta(type):\n    _instances = {}\n\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n        if cls not in cls._instances:\n            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)\n            cls._instances[cls] = instance\n        return cls._instances[cls]\n\nclass LoggingMeta(type):\n    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, dct):\n        print(f\"Creating class {name}\")\n        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, dct)\n\nclass DatabaseConnection(metaclass=SingletonMeta | LoggingMeta):\n    def connect(self):\n        print(\"Connecting to database...\")\n\n# Example usage\ndb1 = DatabaseConnection()\ndb2 = DatabaseConnection()\n\nprint(db1 is db2)  # Output: True\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n- We use Python's type hinting feature with `|` (pipe symbol, which is the bitwise OR operator in Python 3.10+). This syntax allows us to specify that `DatabaseConnection` should have the metaclass behavior of both `SingletonMeta` and `LoggingMeta`.\n- The `__new__` method of `LoggingMeta` logs the creation of each class.\n- When creating an instance of `DatabaseConnection`, both the singleton pattern and logging are respected.",

    "answer": "Part 2 (Answer):\nB) A dictionary key collision might occur if two classes with the same name but different module names are created.\n\n**Explanation**: The provided metaclass `UniqueNameMeta` uses the class's `__name__` attribute to store instances in a class variable `_instances`. This approach will cause a collision if two classes with the same name exist in different modules. For example, if you have `MyClass` in both `module1.py` and `module2.py`, they would be considered the same class by the metaclass, leading to incorrect behavior where instances of these \"same\" classes overwrite each other in the `_instances` dictionary.",

Your solution should handle varying numbers of arguments and keyword arguments.\n\nHere's a starting point for your implementation:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nfrom functools import wraps\n\n# Define the CacheMetaclass here\nclass CacheMetaclass(type):\n    pass\n\n# Define the caching decorator using CacheMetaclass\ndef cache(func):\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        pass  # Your caching logic here\n    return wrapper\n\n# Example usage:\n@cache\ndef expensive_function(x, y):\n    print(\"Computing...\")\n    return x + y\n\n# Create a class that uses the CacheMetaclass and applies the cache decorator\nclass CachingClass(metaclass=CacheMetaclass):\n    @cache\n    def compute(self, a, b):\n        print(\"Computing in class method...\")\n        return a * b\n\n# Test the implementation\nprint(expensive_function(2, 3))  # Should print \"Computing...\" and then return 5\nprint(expensive_function(2, 3))  # Should return 5 without recomputing\ninstance = CachingClass()\nprint(instance.compute(4, 5))  # Should print \"Computing in class method...\" and then return 20\nprint(instance.compute(4, 5))  # Should return 20 without recomputing",
    "answer": "[ANSWER] A\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is A. The provided solution uses a metaclass to ensure that the caching mechanism works across different classes and functions. It also correctly implements a caching decorator using `functools.wraps` for preserving the function's metadata.\n\nTo achieve this, you would define a `CacheMetaclass` as a subclass of `type`, which is used to create new types (classes). The `cache` decorator is then defined to handle caching logic. When applied to a function or method using the `@cache` syntax, it will store results based on the function's arguments and return cached results when the same inputs occur again.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates that the cache works correctly for both standalone functions and methods within a class, storing and returning computed values without recomputation when called with the same arguments.",

    "answer": "### Part 2: Answer\n\nA) The `greet` method will be added to both `MyClass` and `AnotherClass`, but not to any subclass of `AnotherClass`.\n\nExplanation:\n- In Python, metaclasses are used to create classes, and they can modify the class being created. In this case, the `Meta` metaclass adds a `greet` method to any class that uses it as their metaclass.\n- When `MyClass` is defined with `metaclass=Meta`, the metaclass `Meta` modifies `MyClass` by adding the `greet` method.\n- Similarly, when `AnotherClass` inherits from both `Meta` and `MyClass`, it also inherits the `greet` method because `MyClass` already has it due to being modified by `Meta`.\n- However, any subclass of `AnotherClass` will not have the `greet` method unless explicitly defined in that subclass.

The coroutine inside the `with` block then sleeps for 1 second twice, totaling 2 seconds of sleep. However, the total execution time from when the context manager is entered to when it's exited includes these sleep durations plus the time taken by the `__aexit__` method to calculate and print the elapsed time.\n\nThe `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time as follows:\n- Start time: Recorded at the beginning of the context manager.\n- End time: When the coroutine inside the block finishes executing.\n- Elapsed time: Difference between end time and start time, which is 2 seconds (sleep durations) plus the negligible time taken by `__aexit__` itself.\n\nThus, when the output is printed, it shows \"Timer ended in 3.0 seconds,\" indicating that the total execution time includes both sleep durations.",

Since the `User` class does implement this method and the validation logic correctly raises a `ValueError`, the metaclass does not raise any errors. However, when an instance of `User` is created with invalid data (non-string name or age outside the valid range), the `validate_data` method will indeed raise a `ValueError`.

Printing `-1.0` seconds to execute suggests an error in capturing the end time correctly.\n\nCorrect answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem lies in how the timing is calculated. When calculating the duration, it's crucial to subtract the start time from the end time accurately.

In some cases, especially under heavy load or on slower systems, this might lead to negative durations which don't make sense in a real-world scenario.\n\nTo fix the issue, we should ensure that the timing calculation is done correctly.

    "answer": "D) Running this script multiple times will always produce the same output.\n\nExplanation: In Python's asyncio, tasks are scheduled and executed by an event loop. The `asyncio.gather` function waits for all the tasks to complete before proceeding, which means it ensures that all asynchronous operations have finished executing before printing the results. Since the calculations in this code do not depend on any mutable state or external factors that could change between runs, the output will always be consistent and match the expected result of `[15, 13, 12]`.",

This method is responsible for creating new instances of classes. If an instance of a class already exists in `_instances`, it returns that instance instead of creating a new one. Therefore, all instances of `MyClass` are indeed unique based on their class type. Option A is incorrect because it suggests uniqueness based on the object's identity rather than its class.

    "answer": "### Answer\nB) Fetching data... Waiting for data to be fetched... Processing data... Processed Data\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe code creates a task to fetch data using `asyncio.create_task(fetch_data())`. The main function then enters a loop where it prints \"Waiting for data to be fetched...\" every 0.5 seconds until the task is done. Once the task completes, fetching the data, the main function proceeds to process the data by calling `await process_data(data)`, which results in \"Processing data... Processed Data\". The correct order of output reflects that the loop checks for completion periodically and eventually prints the processed data after both tasks complete.",

This is because in Python, names starting with underscores are intended for internal use and should be treated as non-public. \n\nHere's how you can modify the `log_args` decorator to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef log_args(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        if not func.__name__.startswith('_'):\n            print(f\"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}\")\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n\nclass MyClass:\n    @log_args\n    def public_method(self, a, b):\n        return a + b\n    \n    @log_args\n    def _private_method(self, x):\n        return x * 2\n\n# Example usage\nmy_instance = MyClass()\nmy_instance.public_method(1, 2)  # This will print the log\nmy_instance._private_method(3)   # This will not print the log\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that only public method calls are logged, as indicated by the check for non-private method names.",

Inside this decorator, it uses a lock (`lock`) to ensure mutual exclusion when the `increment` method is called. This prevents multiple threads from entering the critical section (the block of code that modifies `self.value`) simultaneously, thus preventing race conditions where multiple increments could be combined into a single increment.\n\nOption B is incorrect because each instance of the `Counter` class should use its own lock for mutual exclusion, but the decorator does not create new locks per instance; it uses a shared lock across all instances.\n\nOption C is incorrect because although the `lock` in `Counter` might seem redundant due to the `thread_safe` decorator, the `lock` inside `Counter` could still be used independently or for additional synchronization mechanisms that are not covered by the `thread_safe` decorator.\n\nOption D is incorrect because without proper synchronization (which this code provides with the `thread_safe` decorator), multiple threads could execute the `increment` method simultaneously, leading to an incorrect final value. The actual final value will depend on how well the synchronization is working and could be less than 1000 if race conditions are not completely prevented.",

Since `MyService` implements a non-blocking `start` method, it successfully sets `self.running` to `True` and prints \"Service started\".\n3. It then calls `check_status`, which returns \"Running\" because `self.running` is `True`.\n4. After that, it calls the `stop` method on `self.service`. This method sets `self.running` back to `False` and prints \"Service stopped\".\n5.

Since `ChildClass` explicitly defines its own `log` method, it overrides the one added by the metaclass.\n- Therefore, when `get_log(child)` is called, it calls the overridden `log` method from `ChildClass`, which returns \"Custom log message\".",

When you call `g.say_hello()`, it executes the `say_hello` method, prints \"Goodbye, World!\", and then the lambda function (which now points to `say_hello`) adds \"Hello, World!\" to its output.

    "question": "[QUESTION]\nYou are tasked with creating a class `AsyncTimer` that will manage asynchronous operations with timeouts. The class should have methods `start` and `stop`. When the timer is started, it should wait for a specified duration and then call a callback function. If the timer is stopped before expiration, it should cancel the operation.\n\nBelow is an incomplete implementation of the `AsyncTimer` class:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nclass AsyncTimer:\n    def __init__(self, timeout):\n        self.timeout = timeout\n        self._task = None\n\n    async def start(self, callback):\n        # Your implementation here\n\n    def stop(self):\n        if self._task and not self._task.done():\n            self._task.cancel()\n```\n\nYour task is to complete the `start` method so that it creates an asynchronous task that waits for `timeout` seconds and then calls the provided `callback` function. If the timer is stopped before expiration, the operation should be canceled.\n\nWhat should the implementation of the `start` method look like?\n\nA) \n```python\nasync def start(self, callback):\n    self._task = asyncio.create_task(callback())\n```\n\nB)\n```python\nasync def start(self, callback):\n    self._task = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.sleep(self.timeout))\n    await self._task\n    if not self._task.done():\n        callback()\n```\n\nC)\n```python\nasync def start(self, callback):\n    async def wrapper():\n        await asyncio.sleep(self.timeout)\n        if not self._task.cancelled():\n            callback()\n    self._task = asyncio.create_task(wrapper())\n```\n\nD)\n```python\nasync def start(self, callback):\n    self._task = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.sleep(self.timeout))\n    try:\n        await self._task\n    except asyncio.CancelledError:\n        pass\n    else:\n        if not self._task.cancelled():\n            callback()\n```",

If it wasn't cancelled, it calls the provided callback function. This ensures that the callback is only called when the timer expires and not if it's stopped prematurely.",

However, it does not handle async initialization properly.\n- The metaclass `SingletonMeta` correctly handles asynchronous instantiation by checking if an instance already exists and returning it if so. It uses the `await super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)` to ensure proper asynchronous initialization of the subclass.\n- In the usage example, both `instance1` and `instance2` are created asynchronously using `await`, but due to the singleton pattern enforced by both the decorator and the metaclass, they point to the same object in memory. Thus, `id(instance1) == id(instance2)` will be True.\n- The condition `instance1.value == instance2.value` is also True because both instances have been initialized with the same value (42 in this case).\n\nOption A is incorrect because of the metaclass's proper handling of asynchronous instantiation.\nOption B is partially correct but not entirely accurate. The instances are async, but only one is created and reused.\nOption D is incorrect because there is no error due to improper usage of async/await with a singleton pattern; it adheres correctly to both the decorator and metaclass implementations.",

    "answer": "Part 2 (Answer):  \nA) The metaclass ensures that all callable attributes within `MyCoroutineClass` are converted to coroutines.\n\nExplanation: \nThe metaclass `Meta` dynamically modifies any callable attribute (methods, functions) in the class it decorates. By wrapping these methods with the `coroutine_decorator`, it turns them into async functions using the `@wraps(func)` decorator to preserve their original properties. When an instance of `MyCoroutineClass` is created and its methods are called, they will execute asynchronously due to being wrapped by the coroutine decorator. This is crucial for maintaining asynchronous behavior throughout the class without explicitly decorating each method in the subclass.",

    "answer": "[ANSWER]\nA) The `__aenter__` method should not be declared as `async`.\n\n**Explanation**: The issue lies in the declaration of the `__aenter__` method. Although it is intended to perform an asynchronous operation (printing), it should be implemented without the `async` keyword because it does not return a coroutine object. Instead, it returns `None`, which is the default behavior and correct for context managers that do not need to return anything.\n\nTo fix this issue, simply remove the `async` keyword from the `__aenter__` method:\n\n```python\nclass Log:\n    def __init__(self, message):\n        self.message = message\n\n    def __aenter__(self):\n        print(f\"Entering log: {self.message}\")\n    \n    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n        if exc_type is None:\n            print(f\"Exiting log without error: {self.message}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Exiting log with error: {exc_value}\")\n\nasync def test_log():\n    async with Log(\"Test\"):\n        await asyncio.sleep(1)\n        raise ValueError(\"Test error\")\n\nimport asyncio\nasyncio.run(test_log())\n```\n\nNow, the context manager will work as intended, printing \"Entering log: Test\", waiting for 1 second, and then printing \"Exiting log with error: Test error\".",

Let's break down how each component is used:\n\n1. **Async Decorator**: The `async_decorator` function is defined to wrap any callable with asyncio.run, which allows calling asynchronous functions directly from synchronous contexts.\n\n2. **Metaclass (AsyncMeta)**: The metaclass `AsyncMeta` dynamically adds the `async_decorator` to all methods defined in classes that use this metaclass. This means that when an instance method like `task` is called on an object created from a class with this metaclass, it will be automatically decorated by `async_decorator`, turning synchronous calls into asynchronous ones.\n\n3. **Async Class (AsyncClass)**: The `AsyncClass` uses the `AsyncMeta` metaclass. This means that any callable method in `AsyncClass` will be automatically wrapped by the async decorator during class creation. As a result, when `obj.task()` is called, it will run asynchronously.\n\n4. **Main Function**: The `main` function creates an instance of `AsyncClass` and calls its `task` method. Due to the metaclass magic, the `task` method is treated as async within the context of this call, even though it's not directly defined as such in the class definition.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print \"Task started\" followed by \"Task completed\". The asynchronous nature ensures that \"Task completed\" is printed after a 1-second delay.",

    "answer": "Part 2 (Answer):\nA) meta_attribute: set by metaclass, decorated_attribute: set by decorator\n\nExplanation:\n- The `Meta` metaclass is invoked during the creation of `MyClass`.

It uses a closure to keep track of the number of calls and only applies the timing functionality if the condition is met.\n  \n- **Option B:** Incorrect.

The program demonstrates the use of a decorator to debug function calls, a singleton metaclass to ensure only one instance of `SingletonClass` exists, and a context manager within the class to manage resources. The output correctly shows that both variables `obj1` and `obj2` are indeed the same instance (`True`), and it properly manages the resource in the `with` statement.\n\nB) This is incorrect because the `debug_decorator` is applied to `SingletonClass`'s constructor, which isn't called due to the singleton pattern. The `managed_resource` context manager is called correctly within the `main` function.\n\nC) This is partially correct as it shows that both `obj1` and `obj2` are the same instance (`True`). However, the output of the resource management part is missing a step where the resource is returned or used. The output should end with \"Releasing resource\".\n\nD) This is incorrect because the return value of the context manager is not printed in the expected format. It should print \"Using Resource\" followed by the result returned from the `yield` statement, which is \"Resource\".",

    "answer": "[B] Modify both the decorator and the metaclass to check if any subclass has the `value` attribute set before allowing instantiation.\n\nExplanation: Both the decorator and the metaclass are currently checking whether an instance or class has a `value` attribute and ensuring it's positive. However, this approach only enforces the condition at the time of instantiation. To ensure that any subclass also adheres to this rule, we need to modify both the decorator and the metaclass to check for the presence of the `value` attribute in subclasses during their creation. This is achieved by overriding the `__init_subclass__` method in the metaclass or ensuring that both mechanisms check if the subclass has the attribute before allowing it to be instantiated.",

However, within each thread, a `ThreadLocalSingleton` object is created and used as a context manager to manage some state. The use of a `ThreadLocalSingleton` means that the state (`_value`) is local to the thread, not shared among threads. Therefore, when multiple threads run concurrently and access the same `Singleton` instance, each will create its own `ThreadLocalSingleton`, and the values set in one thread might not be visible or consistent across other threads. This can lead to different outputs or even errors if the code relies on state consistency between threads.",

    "question": "[QUESTION]\nYou are tasked with creating a Python library that needs to ensure the correct initialization of resources before their use and proper cleanup afterward, regardless of how many times the resource is used or when the program exits. You decide to implement this functionality using context managers.\n\nWrite a context manager class named `ResourceGuard` that ensures a resource (simulated by opening a file) is properly opened at the beginning and closed after all operations within its block are completed. The class should handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring that the resource is always cleaned up if an error occurs during the use of the resource.\n\nYour implementation should include:\n1. An `__enter__` method that opens the file and returns a file object.\n2.

This ensures that the file is opened when entering the context.\n  \n- The `__exit__` method takes three arguments: `exc_type`, `exc_val`, and `exc_tb`. These represent the exception type, value, and traceback if an exception occurred within the context block. If an exception did occur, it prints the error message. Regardless of whether an exception occurred, it always closes the file to ensure proper cleanup.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the resource is always cleaned up properly, even if an error occurs during its use. The `ResourceGuard` class can be used as follows:\n\n```python\nwith ResourceGuard('example.txt') as f:\n    f.write('Hello, world!')\n```\n\nThis will correctly handle file opening and closing, ensuring that the file is closed after writing to it, even if an error occurs during the write operation.",

    "answer": "Part 2 (Answer):\n\n**Answer:** A\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe provided code is almost correct but has a subtle issue. The `LogMeta` metaclass correctly replaces each callable method in the class dictionary with a wrapped version that logs the arguments and then calls the original method. However, there's no explicit call to `super().__new__()` at the end of the `__new__` method inside `LogMeta`. This can lead to unexpected behavior if other metaclasses are involved or if additional base classes have their own metaclass implementations.\n\nTo fix this issue and ensure that the metaclass behaves as expected, you should include a call to `super().__new__()` at the end of the `__new__` method within the `LogMeta` class. This will properly create the new class type with the updated dictionary, ensuring that all methods are correctly wrapped.\n\nOnce this is corrected, the code will log the method calls as expected and print the result when `my_instance.my_method(3, 4)` is called.",

Explain why.\n\n**Options:**\nA) Function Execution Time: X.XX seconds  \nB) Result: 333335000  \nC) An error occurs because `@Cached()` and `@Timer()` cannot be used together.  \nD) Function Execution Time: Y.YY seconds followed by Result: 333335000\n\n[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]\n\n**Part 2: Answer**\n\nB) Result: 333335000  \n\nExplanation:\n\n- The `@Cached()` decorator is applied first, and it caches the result of `compute_heavy_task(10000)`. When `compute_heavy_task` is called with this argument, the cached value is immediately returned.\n  \n- The `@Timer()` decorator measures the execution time of a function. However, since `@Cached()` has already executed and stored the result, the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods of the `Timer` class are not called when `compute_heavy_task(10000)` is invoked for the second time.\n\n- Therefore, the output will only include the cached result:  \n  Result: 333335000",

Your task is to identify the issue with the code and suggest a fix.\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef cache_results(func):\n    cache = {}\n    \n    def wrapper(*args):\n        if args in cache:\n            return cache[args]\n        \n        result = func(*args)\n        cache[args] = result\n        return result\n    \n    return wrapper\n\n@cache_results\ndef expensive_function(x):\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate an expensive operation\n    return x * 2\n\n# Usage\nprint(expensive_function(5))  # Should take about 1 second\nprint(expensive_function(5))  # This should be instant, as it uses the cache\n```\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the issue and provides a suitable fix?\n\nA) The `cache` dictionary is not thread-safe. Use a threading lock to ensure thread safety.\n\nB) The decorator does not handle keyword arguments properly. Modify the `wrapper` function to accept and pass through keyword arguments.\n\nC) The cache should be cleared periodically to prevent memory leaks. Implement a mechanism to clear the cache after a certain period.\n\nD) The `cache_results` decorator is incorrectly using a global scope for the cache dictionary. Encapsulate it in a closure or use a class-based approach.\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**  \nB) The decorator does not handle keyword arguments properly. Modify the `wrapper` function to accept and pass through keyword arguments.\n\nThe issue with the provided code is that it only caches results based on positional arguments, ignoring any keyword arguments. When keyword arguments are used, a new cache entry would be created for each set of keyword arguments, leading to unnecessary computations.\n\nTo fix this, modify the `wrapper` function to accept and pass through both positional and keyword arguments using `*args` and `**kwargs`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef cache_results(func):\n    cache = {}\n    \n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        key = args + tuple(kwargs.items())\n        \n        if key in cache:\n            return cache[key]\n        \n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        cache[key] = result\n        return result\n    \n    return wrapper\n\n@cache_results\ndef expensive_function(x, y=10):\n    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate an expensive operation\n    return x * y\n\n# Usage\nprint(expensive_function(5))  # Should take about 1 second\nprint(expensive_function(5, y=20))  # This should be instant, as it uses the cache with different kwargs\nprint(expensive_function(5))  # This should also be instant, using the same cached result\n```",

When `MyClass` is instantiated, the `AbstractMeta` checks if all methods are abstract. Since `my_method` is not implemented (as it's abstract), an error would normally be raised before reaching the `log_creation` decorator. However, due to the `metaclass=AbstractMeta` syntax, the metaclass is applied first. This means that the `AbstractMeta` will raise a `TypeError` indicating that all methods must be abstract, and it will never reach the `log_creation` decorator. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nB) An error will be raised because `MyClass` does not implement all abstract methods.\n\nExplanation: This statement is correct. When `MyClass` is instantiated, `AbstractMeta` checks if all methods in the class are abstract. Since `my_method` is not implemented (it's marked with `@abstractmethod`), an error will be raised indicating that not all methods are abstract.\n\nC) The `log_creation` decorator will not work because it cannot be applied to a class with a metaclass.\n\nExplanation: This statement is incorrect. While it might seem counterintuitive, decorators can still be used on classes defined with metaclasses. The `log_creation` decorator wraps the original class in a new class (`WrappedClass`) that logs creation and then delegates to the original class. Therefore, option C is not applicable.\n\nD) The `AbstractMeta` metaclass will prevent any instances of `MyClass` from being created.\n\nExplanation: This statement is incorrect. As previously explained, the `AbstractMeta` metaclass checks if all methods are abstract but does not directly prevent instance creation. It only raises an error if it finds that not all methods are implemented as abstract. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is B) An error will be raised because `MyClass` does not implement all abstract methods.",

    "answer": "Answer: B) Use multiprocessing instead of threading.\n\nExplanation: While both threading and multiprocessing can be used to achieve parallelism in Python, they have different use cases due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). In a multi-threaded application, if threads are CPU-bound (i.e., performing heavy computations), the GIL will still limit performance because only one thread can execute at a time. Multiprocessing, on the other hand, allows true parallel execution by creating separate Python processes, each with its own Python interpreter and GIL. This is beneficial when dealing with CPU-bound tasks, as it eliminates the overhead of the GIL and allows for efficient use of multiple processors.

    "answer": "C) Using `asyncio.gather` allows the fetching of data from multiple URLs concurrently, reducing the total time taken compared to sequential execution.\n\nExplanation: The `asyncio.gather` function schedules all tasks concurrently and waits for them to complete. This means that while one task is waiting on a `sleep(2)` call, another can continue executing. As a result, the total time taken is significantly reduced compared to running each URL fetch operation sequentially, which would take 6 seconds (2 seconds per URL).",

When entering the context, it starts an asyncio sleep coroutine that will run for the specified timeout and then print a message. However, since the coroutine does not wait for this timer to complete, it immediately prints \"Waiting for timer...\" and continues execution of `main`. The `AsyncTimer` class itself does not have any influence on when its context manager exits or re-enters; it only manages the lifecycle of the async task created in `__enter__`.\n\nThe correct behavior will be:\n1. \"Waiting for timer...\" printed immediately as the context manager enters.\n2. The main coroutine continues to run and prints \"Continuing after 2 seconds\".\n3. After 3 seconds, if the task hasn't already been cancelled (which it won't have), it would print \"Timer expired after 3 seconds\". However, this part is not reached because the context manager does not wait for the timer to expire before exiting.",

    "answer": "**Part 2: Answer**\nA) The metaclass ensures that `DerivedClass` implements `my_method`, and the decorator prints \"Decorator is active\" before creating any instance of `DerivedClass`.\n\nExplanation:\n- The metaclass `Meta` checks if `my_method` is implemented in any class derived from it. Since `DerivedClass` implements `my_method`, no error is raised.\n- The decorator `my_decorator` wraps the original class with a new class `Wrapper`. When `DerivedClass` is created, its `__init_subclass__` method is called by Python's type system, which in turn calls the `__init_subclass__` of the `Wrapper` class. This results in printing \"Decorator is active\" before the instance of `DerivedClass` is actually created.\n- Therefore, when `d = DerivedClass()` is executed, it correctly prints \"Decorator is active\" and then proceeds to create an instance of `DerivedClass`.",

As a result, when methods are called on an instance of `MyClass`, the wrapper does not have access to the instance context. To fix this, you need to modify the decorator to accept and pass through the `self` parameter correctly:\n\n```python\ndef log_method_calls(func):\n    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        print(f\"Calling {func.__name__} on {self.__class__.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}\")\n        return func(self, *args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n```\n\nBy making this change, the decorator will correctly log which instance's method is being called.",

    "question": "**Part 1 (Question):**\n\nYou are working on a Python project where you need to ensure that all functions in a module are correctly decorated with a custom decorator that measures the execution time of each function. The decorator should also log the name of the function and its execution time.\n\nTo achieve this, you decide to use a metaclass to automatically apply the decorator to all methods defined within any class that inherits from a base class named `TimedClass`.\n\nHere is an example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef timed_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = time.time()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = time.time()\n        print(f\"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run.\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\nclass TimedClassMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():\n            if callable(attr_value):\n                dct[attr_name] = timed_decorator(attr_value)\n        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\nclass TimedClass(metaclass=TimedClassMeta):\n    def method1(self):\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n\n    def method2(self):\n        time.sleep(1.0)\n```\n\nHowever, when you run the following code:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    instance = TimedClass()\n    instance.method1()\n    instance.method2()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nYou notice that the decorator does not seem to be applied correctly. The `method1` and `method2` are not being decorated.\n\n**Question:** What is likely going wrong with the implementation of the `TimedClassMeta` metaclass? \n\nA) The metaclass is not properly defining new attributes in the class dictionary.  \nB) The `timed_decorator` function does not correctly apply to methods that are added dynamically after the class is created.  \nC) The metaclass is being overridden by another class definition elsewhere in your codebase, causing it to be ignored.  \nD) The decorator is not handling asynchronous functions (coroutines).\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nThe correct answer is A) The metaclass is not properly defining new attributes in the class dictionary.\n\nExplanation: When a method is added dynamically to a class after its creation, the `__new__` method of the metaclass will not be called again. This means that any modifications made to the class dictionary within the `__new__` method are only applied to methods defined at the time of the class definition. Any methods added later do not automatically pass through the metaclass and thus are not decorated.\n\nTo fix this issue, you would need to ensure that the `TimedClassMeta` metaclass handles dynamic method addition or consider using a different approach to apply decorators dynamically across an entire module rather than relying on a metaclass.",

However, there's a subtle issue in the implementation of the metaclass that prevents this from working as intended.\n\nWhen `__new__` is called on the metaclass to create a new class `MyClass`, it iterates over all attributes and tries to wrap callable attributes with `log_method_call`. The problem lies in how Python handles attribute access during the definition phase. When the metaclass's `__new__` method is called, the `my_method` has not yet been fully defined in the namespace of `MyClass`. Therefore, when the metaclass tries to wrap `my_method`, it sees a placeholder or an incomplete function object that has not yet been bound to its name.\n\nAs a result, the `log_method_call` method does not correctly recognize `my_method` as the target for wrapping. Instead, it wraps itself recursively, creating an infinite recursion until Python raises a `RecursionError`.\n\nThis example highlights the importance of understanding how attribute resolution and metaclass application work in Python to avoid such issues.",

    "answer": "A) The `cache` decorator correctly caches results for the `fibonacci` function.\n\n**Explanation:** \nThe `cache` decorator uses a dictionary to store the results of expensive function calls, which is intended to improve performance by avoiding repeated calculations. However, the current implementation does not handle different keyword argument orders correctly because it converts the dictionary of keyword arguments into a tuple, which will be different for calls with the same positional arguments but different keyword arguments.

If this dictionary grows indefinitely without bounds (i.e., if there is no mechanism to expire or clean up old entries), it could lead to a memory leak because the dictionary would consume more and more memory over time. However, in this specific example, we do not have such an issue since the `fibonacci` function has a limited range of inputs.\n\nD) The `functools.wraps(func)` is unnecessary here and can be removed without affecting the functionality.\n\n**Explanation:** \nThe `functools.wraps(func)` decorator is used to preserve the metadata (like `__name__`, `__doc__`, etc.) of the original function when it is decorated. While this isn't strictly necessary for the caching mechanism to work, it's often a good practice to include it to ensure that the decorated function behaves as expected in terms of its identity and documentation.

You need to implement a caching mechanism that can dynamically adjust its size based on the current load of the application. The cache should be able to track which items are least recently used and remove them when necessary. \n\nYou decide to use a metaclass along with a custom descriptor to create this flexible and efficient caching system.\n\n1. **Define a metaclass `CacheMeta` that inherits from `type`. This metaclass should override the `__new__` method to dynamically adjust the cache size based on the current load of the application.**\n2. **Create a custom descriptor class `LRUCacheDescriptor` that can be used as an attribute in a class definition to instantiate a least recently used (LRU) cache. The descriptor should handle adding, retrieving, and removing items from the cache.**\n3. **Define a class `DataHandler` using `CacheMeta` as its metaclass and include an `LRUCacheDescriptor` named `cache`.**\n\n```python\n# BEGIN SOLUTION\nclass CacheMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        # Implement logic to adjust cache size based on current load\n        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\nclass LRUCacheDescriptor:\n    def __get__(self, instance, owner):\n        # Return an empty LRU Cache here\n        pass\n    \n    def __set__(self, instance, value):\n        # Set the cache value if it's a valid cache object\n        pass\n\nclass DataHandler(metaclass=CacheMeta):\n    cache = LRUCacheDescriptor()\n# END SOLUTION\n```\n\n**Which of the following statements is true regarding the implementation above?**\n\nA) The `CacheMeta` metaclass can dynamically adjust the size of the cache based on the current load.\nB) The `LRUCacheDescriptor` correctly implements methods for adding, retrieving, and removing items from an LRU Cache.\nC) Both A and B are true.\nD) None of the above.\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nC) Both A and B are true.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA) In order to dynamically adjust the cache size based on the current load, we need a way to monitor the load. This can be done in various ways depending on how you define \"current load\" (e.g., number of requests per minute). The `__new__` method of `CacheMeta` is where such logic would go.\n\nB) To correctly implement methods for adding, retrieving, and removing items from an LRU Cache, the descriptor should handle these operations. Typically, this involves maintaining a data structure like a dictionary to store cache entries and possibly another data structure to keep track of the order of entries (e.g., using `collections.OrderedDict`).\n\nWhile this solution provides a starting point, it lacks some details such as how to monitor load or implement LRU caching logic. However, focusing on these aspects would further challenge the understanding of metaclasses and descriptors in advanced Python programming.",

    "answer": "Part 2 (Answer):\n\nThe correct answer is B) Multiple threads can access and modify the global variable `counter` simultaneously, leading to a race condition.\n\nExplanation: \n\nIn this code, multiple threads are created that all call the `increment_counter` function concurrently. The `synchronized` decorator attempts to ensure that only one thread executes the `increment_counter` function at a time by using a lock. However, due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which does not allow true parallel execution of Python bytecode even in multi-threaded applications on CPUs with multiple cores, all threads may still be running simultaneously at the machine code level.\n\nThe race condition occurs because each thread reads the current value of `counter`, increments it by 1, and then writes the new value back to the global variable. If two or more threads execute this sequence of operations concurrently, they may read the same value of `counter`, both increment it, and write back the same incremented value, effectively losing one increment.\n\nTo avoid race conditions in scenarios like this, you would need a thread-safe counter implementation or use a lock that ensures true atomicity (e.g., using `threading.Lock()` directly in a way that prevents other threads from accessing any shared resources during the critical section).",

Using `threading.Lock()` inside the `__call__` method.\n\nExplanation:\nTo ensure that the singleton pattern works correctly in a multi-threaded environment, it's crucial to prevent multiple threads from creating separate instances of the class simultaneously. This can be achieved by adding a lock mechanism to control access to the `__call__` method. Here is how you could modify the `SingletonMeta` metaclass to include locking:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\nclass SingletonMeta(type):\n    _instances = {}\n    _lock: threading.Lock = threading.Lock()\n\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n        with cls._lock:\n            if cls not in cls._instances:\n                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)\n                cls._instances[cls] = instance\n        return cls._instances[cls]\n```\n\nNow, when multiple threads try to create an instance of `Singleton` simultaneously, the lock will ensure that only one thread can enter the critical section at a time, thus preventing the creation of multiple instances.

For example:\n\n```python\ndef log_execution_time(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start = time.time()  # Capture start time here for each call\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end = time.time()\n        print(f\"Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start} seconds.\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@log_execution_time\ndef compute_sum(n):\n    return sum(range(n))\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that the start time is captured anew for each function call, thus providing accurate execution times.",

Your suspicion is that there might be an issue with how the lock is being used or how instances are being stored.\n\n**Question:**  \nIdentify the potential issues in the given code snippet and provide a corrected version of the metaclass to ensure thread-safe lazy initialization of the singleton.\n\nA) The lock is not acquired correctly.  \nB) Instances are not being stored correctly.  \nC) Both A and B  \nD) There are no issues with the current implementation.\n\n**Part 2: Answer**\n\n**Answer:** C) Both A and B\n\nExplanation:\nThe lock is being used correctly, but there might be an issue with how instances are being stored. The `cls._instances` dictionary should be thread-safe itself, so we don't need a separate lock to manage the dictionary.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the metaclass:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\nclass SingletonMeta(type):\n    _instances = {}\n    _lock: threading.Lock = threading.Lock()\n\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n        with cls._lock:\n            if cls not in cls._instances:\n                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)\n                cls._instances[cls] = instance\n        return cls._instances[cls]\n\nclass Resource(metaclass=SingletonMeta):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data = None\n\n    def initialize(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n\n# Usage example remains the same\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, we ensure that `_instances` is thread-safe by using a separate lock. However, in practice, it's often better to use `threading.local()` for such cases to avoid global locks altogether:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\nclass SingletonMeta(type):\n    _instances = threading.local()\n\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n        if not hasattr(cls._instances, cls):\n            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)\n            cls._instances[cls] = instance\n        return cls._instances[cls]\n\nclass Resource(metaclass=SingletonMeta):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data = None\n\n    def initialize(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n\n# Usage example remains the same\n```\n\nThis approach avoids the need for explicit locking and is generally more efficient.",

    "answer": "[ANSWER] C) The `main` function collects all tasks into a list and runs them concurrently using `asyncio.gather`.\n\nExplanation: This statement is correct. In the provided code, the `main` function creates a list of tasks using a list comprehension. Each task is an instance of the `task` coroutine with different parameters. When `await asyncio.gather(*tasks)` is called in `main`, it schedules all tasks to run concurrently and waits for them to complete before exiting. This demonstrates how `asyncio.gather` can be used to manage multiple asynchronous tasks efficiently.\n\nOption A is incorrect because `await` is used inside an `async def` function, making the entire function asynchronous.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because, although each task starts immediately due to the event loop scheduling, they do not finish in order. The timing of completion depends on the specified sleep duration for each task.\n\nOption D is correct and elaborates on why running this code without `asyncio.run(main())` would result in an error. `asyncio.run()` is required to start the event loop and run the coroutine until it completes, which cannot be done outside a non-async context.",

Identify what is wrong with the code and provide a corrected version of the decorator.\n\n```python\ndef single_run_coroutine(func):\n    has_run = False\n    \n    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        nonlocal has_run\n        if not has_run:\n            await func(*args, **kwargs)\n            has_run = True\n        else:\n            print(\"Coroutine already run\")\n    \n    return wrapper\n\n@single_run_coroutine\nasync def my_coroutine():\n    print(\"Running coroutine\")\n\n# Example usage\nimport asyncio\n\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\nloop.run_until_complete(my_coroutine())\nloop.run_until_complete(my_coroutine())\n```\n\nA. The decorator does not properly handle the asynchronous context of `func`.  \nB. There is no need for a nonlocal variable `has_run` inside the wrapper.  \nC. The decorator should return an instance method instead of a coroutine function.  \nD. The usage of `nonlocal` is incorrect in this context.\n\n**Answer:** A. The decorator does not properly handle the asynchronous context of `func`.\n\n**Explanation:** The issue with the original code is that it attempts to use `await` outside of an asynchronous function. In Python, `await` can only be used inside functions marked as `async`. To fix this, the wrapper itself should be defined as an `async def`.

In the provided code, the metaclass `Singleton` attempts to implement this pattern by storing instances in a dictionary `_instances`. However, the code is incomplete and does not fully enforce the Singleton pattern correctly. Specifically, there are no checks to ensure that if an instance already exists, it is returned instead of creating a new one. Additionally, the dictionary `_instances` is not thread-safe, which could lead to multiple instances being created in a multi-threaded environment.

    "question": "Part 1 (Question): \n\nImagine you have a Python script that needs to handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations efficiently. You decide to use `asyncio` for the asynchronous tasks but need a way to seamlessly integrate it with existing synchronous code without rewriting everything as an asynchronous function.\n\nYou create a decorator called `run_async_if_needed` that checks if the current execution context allows for asynchronous calls (i.e., if there's an event loop running). If it does, the decorator should run the wrapped function asynchronously using `asyncio.run()`. Otherwise, it should just call the function synchronously.\n\nHere’s the initial implementation of `run_async_if_needed`:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\ndef run_async_if_needed(func):\n    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        return await func(*args, **kwargs)\n    \n    def sync_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    if asyncio.get_event_loop().is_running():\n        return wrapper\n    else:\n        return sync_wrapper\n\n# Example usage\n@run_async_if_needed\nasync def async_task():\n    print(\"Running an asynchronous task\")\n\ndef sync_task():\n    print(\"Running a synchronous task\")\n```\n\nNow, consider the following scenario:\n\n1. You have an event loop running.\n2. You call `sync_task()` within a context where there is no active event loop (e.g., in a new thread).\n3. You attempt to call `async_task()` from that same thread.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes what will happen when you run this code?\n\nA) Both `sync_task()` and `async_task()` will execute synchronously.\nB) `sync_task()` will execute synchronously, but `async_task()` will raise an error.\nC) Both `sync_task()` and `async_task()` will attempt to create a new event loop and execute asynchronously.\nD) `sync_task()` will execute synchronously, and `async_task()` will be executed asynchronously using the current event loop.",
    "answer": "Part 2 (Answer):\n\nA) Both `sync_task()` and `async_task()` will execute synchronously.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- When `sync_task()` is called with an active event loop, the decorator checks if there's an event loop running. Since there is one, it uses the synchronous wrapper (`sync_wrapper`), which simply calls the function without any change.\n- For `async_task()`, even though there is an event loop, the decorator checks and determines that since it’s already running inside an async context (i.e., within a function marked with `@run_async_if_needed` or called from another async function), it should not attempt to run it again. Thus, it calls the synchronous wrapper (`sync_wrapper`) which simply returns the result of `async_task()`, effectively executing it synchronously without creating a new event loop.",

If an attribute is callable (i.e., it's a method), the `timer` decorator is applied to that method, allowing any instance of `MyClass` to call this decorated method and automatically measure how long each method takes to execute.

The `start` method in `AsyncTimer` uses `asyncio.sleep`, which makes it an asynchronous method that runs on the asyncio event loop, making B true. Statement C is incorrect because `main` is a normal function that returns a coroutine object, not a generator.

Since it is (`MyClass.x = 5`), it sets `y` to twice the value of `x`. Therefore, `MyClass.y` is calculated as `10`.\n- For `AnotherClass`, there is no attribute `x` defined in its dictionary. The metaclass does not modify the class dictionary since 'x' is absent, so `y` remains undefined and will be `None` when accessed.\n\nThis question tests your understanding of how metaclasses can dynamically modify class attributes and handle cases where certain conditions are not met.",

    "answer": "[ANSWER]\nA) Implement a method `is_async_context()` to check if the current context is asynchronous, then open/close files accordingly.\n\n**Explanation:** The correct approach involves checking whether the current execution context is synchronous or asynchronous. This can typically be done by trying to run an asynchronous function and catching any resulting exceptions. If an exception is caught, it indicates that the code is running in a synchronous context, allowing the synchronous file handling methods to be called. Conversely, if no exceptions are caught, the code is running asynchronously, allowing the asynchronous file handling methods to be called.\n\nOption A correctly implements this logic by introducing an `is_async_context()` method to determine the current context and then appropriately opening or closing files based on whether the context is synchronous or asynchronous.",

    "answer": "A**\n\n**Explanation:** \n\nThe `my_decorator` function is designed as a class decorator that takes a class `cls`, and returns a new class `Wrapper`. The `Wrapper` class inherits from both `ABC` (making it an abstract base class) and the original class passed to the decorator (`cls`). This setup ensures that any subclass of `MyClass` will be an instance of `Wrapper`, which means any object created from `MyClass` will have additional behavior defined in the `Wrapper` class.\n\nIn this case, the `__new__` method of `Wrapper` is overridden to modify the attributes of the instances it creates. It sets `instance.modified_attr = \"Decorator Modified\"`. This modification happens every time an instance of `MyClass` (or any subclass) is created, which is what happens in the `main` function when calling `obj = MyClass()`.\n\nHowever, there are a few issues with this code:\n1. The decorator does not properly implement abstract methods from the base class (`ABC`). This will result in an error if an attempt is made to instantiate `MyClass` directly (which is not possible due to the decorator).\n2. The `main` function calls an abstract method, which will raise a `TypeError` since no concrete implementation of the abstract method exists.\n\nDespite these issues, the primary question focuses on understanding how metaclasses and decorators can be used together to modify class behavior. Since the decorator does indeed add the attribute `modified_attr` to instances of `MyClass`, option A is the closest correct answer based on the given code structure, even though the overall functionality will fail due to abstract method issues.\n\nIf the abstract method was properly implemented in a subclass or directly in `MyClass`, the output would be:\n```\nDecorator Modified\n```",

Inside the `__new__` method of the metaclass, it prints the message \"Creating class {name}\", where `{name}` is the name of the class being created (`'MyClass'`).

You want to create a decorator that automatically logs the arguments with which a function is called, but only if the environment variable `DEBUG` is set to `True`. However, you also need this logging functionality to be optional and not affect the performance of the application when debugging is disabled.\n\nYour task is to implement this feature using decorators. You should ensure that the decorator checks for the existence of the `DEBUG` environment variable before logging. If it's not present or is set to any value other than `True`, the function should execute without logging.\n\nHere's a starting point:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef log_arguments(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        # Check if DEBUG environment variable is True\n        if os.getenv('DEBUG') == 'True':\n            print(f\"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}\")\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n\n@log_arguments\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n```\n\nNow, you're tasked with ensuring that this decorator is only applied to functions when `DEBUG` is set to `True`.

Each coroutine can use `asyncio`'s mechanisms to perform non-blocking I/O operations efficiently.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Use threading or multiprocessing to manage separate threads or processes for each connection.",

If not, it adds the current time as a timestamp.\n- Each time an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `__new__` method of its metaclass will be invoked. This means that each instance will get its own unique `created_at` timestamp at the moment of creation.\n- Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:\n  - Option B suggests all instances share a single timestamp, which is not what happens due to the use of `time.time()` inside `__new__`.\n  - Option C is incorrect as the `created_at` attribute is successfully added to each instance.\n  - Option D incorrectly implies that creating an instance will raise an error, which does not occur with this implementation.",

For asynchronous functions, it incorrectly reports zero execution time because the synchronous timing logic (`time.time()`) is used instead of waiting for the coroutine to complete with `await`.\n2.

The decorator is applied to two functions, `add` and `multiply`. Each function call inside these decorated functions will indeed log its entry and exit with the correct function name, making this statement true.",

    "question": "Part 1 (Question):\nYou are developing a web application that requires a feature to manage user sessions. The requirement is that every session should have a timeout after which it is automatically closed by the system. You decide to use Python decorators for this purpose.\n\nCreate a decorator `@session_timeout(timeout)` that can be applied to any function representing an endpoint in your application. When the decorated function is called, it should start a countdown timer based on the provided `timeout` value (in seconds). If the function takes more time than the specified timeout to execute, the session should be closed and an error message returned.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this decorator:\n\n```python\n@session_timeout(10)  # This endpoint has a 10-second timeout\ndef user_dashboard():\n    time.sleep(5)\n    return \"User Dashboard\"\n```\n\nWhen `user_dashboard()` is called, it should execute within the first 10 seconds. If it takes longer than that, an error message should be returned.\n\nWhich of the following is a correct implementation of the `@session_timeout` decorator?\n\nA) Using threading.Timer to check execution time\nB) Using asyncio.sleep to enforce the timeout\nC) Modifying function arguments to include a timeout parameter\nD) None of the above\n\nPart 2 (Answer):\nA) Using threading.Timer to check execution time\nExplanation: The correct implementation would involve using `threading.Timer` to start a countdown timer when the decorated function is called. If the function does not complete within the specified timeout, the timer should trigger an action to close the session and return an error message. This approach allows for asynchronous handling of timeouts without blocking other parts of the application.",

The `wrapper` function checks if the result for the given arguments is already in the cache. If it is, it returns the cached result; otherwise, it computes the result, stores it in the cache, and then returns the computed value.\n\n- Option A is correct because the code works as intended for caching results based on arguments.\n- Option B is incorrect because while the code handles `args` correctly, it does not handle `kwargs`. If different keyword arguments lead to the same positional arguments, they will overwrite each other in the cache.\n- Option C is incorrect because dictionaries are not inherently thread-safe. In a multi-threaded environment, concurrent access and modification of the cache dictionary would require additional synchronization mechanisms like locks.\n- Option D is incorrect because decorators on methods need to be more complex due to the presence of `self` as an argument in methods. The decorator needs to handle this special case appropriately.\n\nThis question tests deep understanding of how decorators work and their limitations, especially when it comes to handling different types of arguments and thread safety.",

    "question": "[QUESTION]\nYou are tasked with optimizing a Python application that makes multiple asynchronous HTTP requests. The current implementation uses the `requests` library in synchronous mode, which blocks the execution until each request completes. To improve performance, you decide to use an asynchronous library like `aiohttp`. However, you want to keep your code clean and avoid manually managing tasks and events.\n\nYou create a custom decorator to handle asynchronous HTTP requests using `aiohttp`. The decorator should take a URL as an argument and return the response from the server. Here is the initial implementation of the decorator:\n\n```python\nimport aiohttp\nimport asyncio\n\ndef async_request(url):\n    async def wrapper():\n        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n            async with session.get(url) as response:\n                return await response.text()\n    return wrapper\n```\n\nYou then use this decorator on a function that fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently. However, when you run the application, it seems that requests are still being made sequentially rather than concurrently. What is the issue with the current implementation of the `async_request` decorator and how can you fix it to ensure that requests are made concurrently?\n\nA) The `wrapper` function does not use `await`, so the requests are executed synchronously.\n\nB) The `asyncio.run()` function should be used to run the main coroutine, but it is missing from the code.\n\nC) The decorator itself needs to be modified to return a coroutine that can be awaited when called.\n\nD) None of the above",
    "answer": "C) The decorator itself needs to be modified to return a coroutine that can be awaited when called.\n\nThe issue with the current implementation is that the `wrapper` function is not defined as an asynchronous function, which means it does not use the `async` keyword. As a result, calling `await wrapper()` will not actually await the completion of the asynchronous request but instead will immediately return the coroutine object itself.\n\nTo fix this, you need to modify the decorator to ensure that the inner function is defined using the `async def` syntax and that it returns a coroutine that can be awaited. Here's the corrected version of the decorator:\n\n```python\nimport aiohttp\nimport asyncio\n\ndef async_request(url):\n    async def wrapper():\n        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n            async with session.get(url) as response:\n                return await response.text()\n    return wrapper\n```\n\nWhen used correctly in your application, this decorator will allow you to make asynchronous HTTP requests concurrently, significantly improving the performance of your application.",

    "answer": "A) The `TimeStampMeta` metaclass automatically sets the `created_at` attribute for all instances of any class it decorates.\n\nExplanation: \n- A metaclass in Python is a class whose instances are classes. In this case, `TimeStampMeta` is used to create a new type with an additional attribute (`created_at`) that records the time when an instance is created.\n- The `__new__` method of the metaclass is called during the creation of a new class, and it modifies the class dictionary by adding or updating methods. However, in this example, the `TimeStampMeta` overrides the `__init__` method to set the `created_at` attribute when an instance is created.\n- Since the `__init__` method is overridden in the metaclass, it will always be called when creating an instance of any class that uses this metaclass, regardless of whether a custom `__init__` method is defined in the subclass.\n- Therefore, the correct behavior is that the `TimeStampMeta` automatically sets the `created_at` attribute for all instances of any class it decorates.",
