The goal is to measure the execution time of an async function. However, the current implementation does not work as expected.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\ndef time_decorator(func):\n    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()\n        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()\n        print(f\"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@time_decorator\nasync def sample_async_function():\n    await asyncio.sleep(2)\n    return \"Done\"\n\n# Running the function to test\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\nresult = loop.run_until_complete(sample_async_function())\n```\n\nWhat is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed?\n\nA) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  \nB) The decorator works as expected, but the output format is incorrect.  \nC) The decorator should use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):` instead of `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`.  \nD) The decorator should not measure execution time for asynchronous functions.\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nA) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  \nExplanation: The issue with the code lies in how the timing is being recorded. Since `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a function that provides the current time, it should be called directly to get the actual timestamp, not awaited. The correct usage would be `start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` and `end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`. This will give the current event loop's time in seconds when the function starts and ends, allowing the difference to calculate execution time.\n\n[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]",

    "question": "Part 1 (Question): \nImagine you are developing a web application where users can upload files. You want to ensure that only specific types of files (e.g., .txt, .pdf) can be uploaded. To achieve this, you decide to use decorators and metaclasses in Python.\n\nYou create a decorator `@allowed_file_types` that checks if the file type is allowed. Then, you define a metaclass `FileTypeMeta` that automatically applies the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to any class derived from it, setting the allowed types as a parameter.\n\nHere's a code snippet to get you started:\n\n```python\ndef allowed_file_types(*types):\n    def wrapper(cls):\n        cls.allowed_types = types\n        return cls\n    return wrapper\n\nclass FileTypeMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        if 'allowed_types' not in dct:\n            dct['allowed_types'] = ()\n        super_new = super(FileTypeMeta, cls).__new__\n        return super_new(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\nclass AllowedFiles(metaclass=FileTypeMeta):\n    pass\n\nclass TextFile(AllowedFiles):\n    # TODO: Apply the allowed_file_types decorator here\n    pass\n\n# Example usage:\ntxt_file = TextFile()\nprint(txt_file.allowed_types)  # Should print ('.txt',)\n```\n\nWhich of the following ways can you correctly apply the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to the `TextFile` class using the metaclass?\n\nA) Use a direct assignment in the class definition.\nB) Override the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute.\nC) Use a class variable directly within the class definition.\nD) Call the `@allowed_file_types` decorator directly on the class.",
    "answer": "Part 2 (Answer): \nA) Direct assignment is not an option because decorators are applied before the class is fully defined, and direct assignment would occur after the class is created.\n\nB) Correct. By overriding the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute, you can ensure that any subclass of `AllowedFiles` will have its `allowed_types` attribute set by default if not explicitly provided.\n\nC) This would work but doesn't utilize the decorator mechanism and isn't as clean or flexible as using a metaclass.\n\nD) Calling the decorator directly on the class is also not correct because it bypasses the metaclass's influence, which should be used to set the `allowed_types` attribute.",

    "answer": "A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe provided decorator `time_decorator` is synchronous and will measure the total execution time of a synchronous function by capturing the start time before the function call and the end time after the function call. However, it does not account for the case where the function itself might be a coroutine (an asynchronous function). To handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly, you would need to modify the decorator to check if the decorated function is a coroutine using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`. If it is, you should use an asynchronous version of time measurement with `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete`.\n\nA corrected version of the decorator that handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions might look like this:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\nimport inspect\n\ndef time_decorator(func):\n    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):\n        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            start_time = time.time()\n            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)\n            end_time = time.time()\n            print(f\"Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n            return result\n    else:\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            start_time = time.time()\n            result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n            end_time = time.time()\n            print(f\"Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n            return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@time_decorator\nasync def compute_sum(n):\n    return sum(range(n))\n```\n\nThis version of the decorator uses conditional logic to determine whether to measure synchronous or asynchronous functions.",

    "answer": "C) Both \"Task 1\" and \"Task 2\" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.\n\nExplanation: The `Timer` class is designed as an asynchronous context manager, which means it can be used in an async block (`async with`).

The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time after exiting the block and prints it.

However, your script also needs to maintain state across multiple asynchronous tasks without using global variables or mutable shared data structures.\n\nWhich of the following approaches would be most suitable for maintaining state between asynchronous tasks while optimizing I/O operations?\n\nA) Using a class-based state management system that inherits from `asyncio.Lock` and handles all state transitions asynchronously\n\nB) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup\n\nC) Implementing a custom metaclass that tracks state across asynchronous tasks by intercepting attribute access and modification\n\nD) Creating a global dictionary to store state information, which is thread-safe due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\n**B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup**\n\nThis approach is the most suitable for several reasons:\n1. **State Management**: `AsyncExitStack` allows you to manage multiple asynchronous context managers efficiently, ensuring that resources are cleaned up properly even if an exception occurs.\n2. **Concurrency Safety**: By using `asyncio.Queue`, you can safely share state across tasks without worrying about race conditions or synchronization issues, making the system more robust and scalable.\n3. **Asynchronous Operations**: Since both `AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` are asynchronous constructs, they integrate seamlessly with other asynchronous components of your application, improving overall performance and responsiveness.\n\nThe other options have limitations:\n- **Option A** uses `asyncio.Lock`, which is more for synchronization rather than state management.\n- **Option C**, while it might be interesting, introduces unnecessary complexity and potential issues related to maintaining state in a metaclass, especially since metaclasses are not directly designed for this purpose.\n- **Option D** relies on the GIL, which would limit performance gains from asynchronous programming, as it doesn't take advantage of multiple cores or threads effectively.",

    "answer": "**Part 1 (Question):**\n\nConsider the following Python code that aims to create a custom metaclass for logging class instantiation and method calls. However, it contains a critical bug that causes unexpected behavior.\n\n```python\nclass LoggingMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        print(f\"Creating class {name}\")\n        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():\n            if callable(attr_value):\n                setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))\n        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def log_method(method):\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            print(f\"Calling method {method.__name__} with args {args}, kwargs {kwargs}\")\n            return method(*args, **kwargs)\n        return wrapper\n\nclass MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.value += 1\n```\n\nWhich of the following is the correct diagnosis for why `MyClass` instances do not log method calls as expected?\n\nA) The metaclass's `__new__` method is incorrectly overriding the class dictionary.\n\nB) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.\n\nC) Using `setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))` modifies the class dictionary in an unintended way.\n\nD) The `wrapper` function inside `log_method` is incorrectly capturing its arguments.\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nB) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.\n\nThe issue with the provided code is that the `log_method` static method is intended to return a new callable that logs when the wrapped method is called. However, it incorrectly modifies the `wrapper` function's closure by using `*args, **kwargs`, which prevents it from capturing the correct arguments and keyword arguments of the original method.\n\nTo fix this, one should avoid modifying the `wrapper` function in-place within `log_method`. A better approach would be to define a new callable object that captures the original method and its signature correctly. Here is a corrected version of the code:\n\n```python\nclass LoggingMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        print(f\"Creating class {name}\")\n        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():\n            if callable(attr_value):\n                setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))\n        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def log_method(method):\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            print(f\"Calling method {method.__name__} with args {args}, kwargs {kwargs}\")\n            return method(*args, **kwargs)\n        return type(f\"{method.__name__}_wrapper\", (object,), {'__call__': wrapper})()\n\nclass MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.value += 1\n```\n\nThis version of `log_method` returns a callable object that wraps the original method and provides logging functionality without modifying its signature or scope in an unintended way.",

This method returns the number of items in the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which typically includes all non-private attributes of the class (i.e., those not starting with an underscore). Therefore, when `MyClass` is created, the `__len__` method will return 2, as there are two attributes (`a` and `b`) in the `MyClass`.

Each of these methods tries to manage the instance creation, leading to conflicts when an instance is created through one method (metaclass) and later attempted again through another (decorator). The correct approach would be to use either the metaclass or the decorator but not both. If using a metaclass, it should handle all instance creation logic within its `__call__` method. If using a decorator, it should manage instances outside of class definitions and apply it to methods that need to return singleton instances rather than applying it directly to the class.",

    "answer": "A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.\n\n**Explanation:** \nOption A is correct. In Python, decorators are functions that take another function and extend its behavior without explicitly modifying it. The `wrapper` function captures the execution time by recording the start and end times around the call to the original function `func`. This extended behavior is then returned when `compute_sum` is called.\n\n**Option B:**\nWhile the decorator does use a closure, this is not what makes it modify the original function. A closure only affects how variables are bound within nested functions. The modification happens through the way the `wrapper` function is defined and returned by the `timer` decorator.\n\n**Option C:**\nThis statement is incorrect because the `wrapper` function does not replace `compute_sum`. Instead, it wraps around `compute_sum` to add the timing functionality.\n\n**Option D:**\nThe execution time is printed inside the `wrapper` function each time `compute_sum` is called. It is not a one-time print outside of the function call.",

It measures the time taken by the function it decorates (`func`) and prints this duration. However, it does not modify the return value of the function being decorated. Therefore, when `compute_sum(100000)` is called with the `@timing_decorator` applied, it will print the execution time and then return the result of `sum(range(1))`, which is 5000050000, as expected.\n\nThe decorator can be used with coroutine functions without issues. However, in Python, decorators are not directly applicable to coroutines due to differences in how they are executed and awaited, so attempting to use a timing decorator on a coroutine would not raise an error but would likely not function as intended. The decorator's implementation here is straightforward and does not involve complex interactions that could lead to errors with coroutines or cause stack overflows.",

It wraps each method in a lock context manager, which means that only one thread can execute any of the wrapped methods at a time.\n  \n- However, this protection does not extend to other methods like `get_value`. If another method were to access or modify the state without using the lock, it could lead to race conditions even though `increment` is protected.\n\n- In the given code, each thread calls `increment`, which is protected by the lock. Since no other threads can call `increment` at the same time, there will be no data corruption for incrementing the counter. However, calling `get_value` from multiple threads simultaneously could lead to race conditions unless additional synchronization measures are taken.\n\n- Therefore, option B accurately describes that while the `thread_safe` decorator makes `increment` thread-safe, it does not cover all methods in the `Counter` class.",

The goal is to enhance each method's functionality without modifying its implementation.\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef measure_time(cls):\n    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():\n        if callable(value):\n            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))\n    return cls\n\ndef _time_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start = time.time()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end = time.time()\n        print(f\"Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@measure_time\nclass ExampleClass:\n    def method1(self):\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n\n    def method2(self):\n        time.sleep(1)\n```\n\n**Question:** What is the issue with this implementation of the `measure_time` decorator, and how might you fix it to ensure that the original method behavior remains intact?\n\nA) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.\n\nB) The decorator modifies the class in-place which could cause issues if multiple instances are created.\n\nC) The `wrapper` function is not capturing the correct reference of the original method.\n\nD) The `measure_time` decorator should be a metaclass instead of a class decorator to avoid modifying the class directly.",
    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n\n**Correct Answer:** A) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.\n\n**Explanation:** The current implementation assumes that all attributes in the class dictionary are callable methods, but it fails to distinguish between static methods and instance methods. When a method is called on an instance, Python first checks if it exists in the instance's `__dict__`, then in its class. Since the decorator replaces all callables with wrappers, it mistakenly tries to wrap static methods as well, leading to errors.\n\nTo fix this, you need to ensure that only instance methods are wrapped. Here is a corrected version of the `measure_time` decorator:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef measure_time(cls):\n    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():\n        if callable(value) and not isinstance(value, staticmethod):\n            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))\n    return cls\n\ndef _time_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        start = time.time()\n        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)\n        end = time.time()\n        print(f\"Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@measure_time\nclass ExampleClass:\n    def method1(self):\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def method2():\n        time.sleep(1)\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the decorator checks if the callable is not a staticmethod using `isinstance(value, staticmethod)` before wrapping it, ensuring that only instance methods are modified.",

You decide to use Python's asyncio library for handling async tasks and a custom metaclass to enhance class behavior dynamically.\n\n1. Create an `AsyncHandler` metaclass that automatically converts any method in the class decorated with `@async_method` into an asynchronous coroutine using asyncio.\n2. Implement a class `RequestProcessor` that uses this metaclass and includes methods `fetch_data` (synchronous) and `update_cache` (asynchronous).

    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n\n**Answer:** B) The output will be \"INFO: Starting\", \"INFO: Processing\", \"INFO: Ending\" in that specific order.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe given code uses `asyncio.gather` to concurrently run multiple tasks, each of which logs a message. Since all tasks are awaited within the `main` function, they will execute in sequence because `asyncio.gather` schedules them to run as soon as possible but does not guarantee their order if there is any overlap.\n\nTo ensure that `logger` is not garbage collected before all logging tasks complete, we need to keep a reference to it. In Python, an object is considered garbage collectible only when there are no more references pointing to it. By keeping the `logger` variable in scope until after all tasks have completed, it ensures that it remains alive long enough for the garbage collector to determine if it can be freed.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nclass AsyncLogger:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    \n    async def log(self, message):\n        print(f\"{self.name}: {message}\")\n\nasync def main():\n    logger = AsyncLogger(\"INFO\")\n    await asyncio.gather(\n        logger.log(\"Starting\"),\n        logger.log(\"Processing\"),\n        logger.log(\"Ending\")\n    )\n    del logger  # Explicitly deleting the reference to allow garbage collection\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the `logger` variable is explicitly deleted after all tasks have completed. This ensures that `logger` can be garbage collected if no other references to it exist. However, in practical scenarios, you generally don’t need to explicitly delete variables as Python’s garbage collector handles most cases automatically.",

    "answer": "B) Create a separate `AsyncTimer` class that inherits from `Timer` but overrides the context management protocol for async contexts.\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is option B. To make the existing `Timer` class work with asynchronous functions, we need to create an `AsyncTimer` class that overrides the context management protocol specifically for use in asynchronous code. This involves implementing methods like `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` instead of the standard `__enter__` and `__exit__`. The existing `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods should be preserved for synchronous use, as they will still work with non-async contexts.

Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method  \nD) An error will occur because `my_decorator` cannot be applied to methods in Python 3\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nThe correct answer is C) Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method.\n\nExplanation: In Python 3, decorators can indeed be applied to instance methods within a class using metaclasses or by directly applying decorators at method definition. Here's how it works:\n\n- When you apply `@my_decorator` above the method `my_method`, it wraps the method with another function that adds some pre and post-execution behavior.\n- The `__metaclass__ = type` in the class declaration is necessary because, starting from Python 3, classes are first-class objects and need a metaclass to be properly instantiated. If you omit this line, Python will raise an error because it cannot instantiate a class without a valid metaclass.\n\nTherefore, when you create an instance `obj` of `MyClass` and call `obj.my_method()`, the output will be as follows:\n1. The pre-function call message is printed.\n2. The method's code runs, printing \"Hello from my_method\".\n3. The post-function call message is printed.\n\nThis demonstrates that decorators can indeed modify class methods in Python 3, even when using metaclasses for class instantiation.",

This means that when `slow_task` is called, it first waits for 2 seconds (due to the decorator), and then proceeds with its original execution.

Then, after another second (total of 3 seconds), \"Main function completed\"\n\nSo, option A is the correct answer as it matches the described behavior.",

    "answer": "[A] The decorator correctly measures and prints the execution time of `my_function`.\n\n**Explanation:** This statement is incorrect. While the decorator does correctly measure the time taken by the function, it incorrectly calculates the total time as the sum of the start and end times instead of their difference. As a result, the output will be `Function my_function took 0.0 seconds to execute.` because `end_time - start_time` is not being computed properly.\n\n[B] There's a mistake in the decorator that prevents it from working as intended.\n\n**Explanation:** This statement is correct. The error lies in how the timing calculation is performed. It should be `end_time - start_time`, not `start_time + end_time`. This small mistake will result in incorrect timing values being printed.\n\n[C] Using decorators for timing can significantly impact the performance of decorated functions due to the overhead introduced.\n\n**Explanation:** This statement is correct. Decorators add a layer of indirection, which introduces some overhead. While the impact might not be noticeable for very short functions, it could become significant when applied to performance-critical code.\n\n[D] All functions decorated with `@timer` will have their execution time printed when called.\n\n**Explanation:** This statement is correct. The decorator `timer` is correctly defined and applied to `my_function`, so when `my_function()` is called, its execution time will be printed.",

The correct answer highlights that the `SingletonMeta` metaclass overrides the `__call__` method to control the instantiation process, ensuring that each time an instance of `Database` is created, the same pre-existing instance is returned, thus making `db1` and `db2` the same object.",

First and foremost, it does not account for any arguments that might be passed to the decorated function.

Additionally, the decorator should ideally handle functions with parameters gracefully by accepting *args and **kwargs so that it can forward these to the actual function call.

    "answer": "[ANSWER] D) The cache will only store results for unique sequences of recursive calls that lead to different outcomes.\n\n**Explanation**: The `cache_results` decorator is designed to cache the results of function calls based on their arguments. In this case, it caches the results of the Fibonacci sequence calculations. When a call to `fibonacci(n)` is made, the decorator first checks if the result for those arguments is already in the cache. If not, it computes the result using the function (in this case, the Fibonacci calculation), stores it in the cache, and then returns the result. For recursive functions like `fibonacci`, different sequences of calls to reach the same base case will produce different results, leading to unique keys in the cache.

    "answer": "D) The metaclass is used to dynamically add a method to all classes in the application.\n\nExplanation: In Python, a metaclass is a class that creates and controls other classes. When you define a class with `metaclass=AddMethodMeta`, every instance of that class will have a new method called `new_method`. This is true regardless of whether other classes use the same metaclass or not. The `MyClass` defined in this example is an exception to this rule, as it does not explicitly declare `new_method`, but instances of any class using `AddMethodMeta` will have access to it. Option A is incorrect because only classes explicitly decorated with `AddMethodMeta` will get the new method. Options B and C are incorrect because calling `obj.new_method()` on an instance of a class that does not use `AddMethodMeta` would raise an AttributeError, but since `MyClass` is an exception to this rule, it would not be the case here.",

    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n\n**Correct Answer: B**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe code uses threading to create multiple threads that increment the shared `counter` object. Each thread performs 1000 increments on the counter. The critical section in the `increment` method is protected by a lock, which means that at any given time, only one thread can execute the code within this section.\n\nHowever, there are race conditions present in the code. Even though each increment operation is atomic (i.e., it cannot be interrupted), multiple threads can still see and modify `_value` concurrently before their changes are fully written back to memory. This can lead to situations where two or more threads read the same value for `_value`, both increment it, and then write back their incremented values, resulting in a net increase of less than 1000 increments.\n\nTherefore, while the lock ensures that individual increment operations are thread-safe, the overall operation is still subject to race conditions when multiple threads attempt to modify the shared counter concurrently. This means that the final value printed by the program may be less than 10000, making option B correct.",

The metaclass dynamically renames each attribute by prefixing it with an underscore and creating a property that accesses this new private attribute.\n\nIn the `MyClass`, an attribute named `__value` is defined, but due to the metaclass's behavior, there will be no direct access to this attribute from outside the class. Instead, a property named `value` should be created by the metaclass. However, in the provided code, there is no method to handle this transformation correctly.\n\nWhen you attempt to access `obj.value`, Python looks for an attribute or property with that name on `MyClass`. Since no such property exists due to the incorrect implementation of the metaclass, it raises an `AttributeError`.\n\nThe correct behavior would require adding a method in the metaclass to dynamically create and assign properties for each original attribute.",

In this case, the lock prevents multiple threads from entering the `with` block at the same time, ensuring that the data modification is thread-safe.\n\nThe `ThreadSafeSingleton` class itself uses a dictionary (`data`) to store data, and the `add_data_to_singleton` function demonstrates how to use the singleton instance within a context manager. The lock ensures that when the 'temp' key is added, it does not interfere with any other thread attempting to access or modify the same key concurrently.\n\nTherefore, after executing the script, the size of the data dictionary will be `1`, indicating that one item has been successfully added through the context manager while maintaining thread safety.",

    "answer": "**Part 1 (Question):**\n\nImagine you are tasked with creating a system for managing user sessions in an asynchronous web application. You want to ensure that each session has a timeout mechanism, and any session that exceeds this time limit should automatically expire. \n\nYou decide to implement this using Python's `asyncio` library. However, you also want to make sure that the session management logic is easily reusable across different parts of your application without duplicating code.\n\nTo achieve this, you consider creating a decorator for sessions that automatically handles the timeout. You then create a metaclass that applies this decorator to any class that represents a session.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\ndef session_timeout(timeout):\n    def decorator(cls):\n        async def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n            task = loop.create_task(self.__aenter__(*args, **kwargs))\n            try:\n                result = await asyncio.wait_for(task, timeout=timeout)\n                return result\n            except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n                task.cancel()\n                raise Exception(\"Session timed out\")\n        cls.__aenter__ = wrapper\n        return cls\n    return decorator\n\nclass SessionMeta(type):\n    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, dct):\n        if 'session_timeout' in dct:\n            dct['session_timeout'] = session_timeout(dct['session_timeout'])\n        return super().__new__(mcls, name, bases, dct)\n\nclass AsyncSession(metaclass=SessionMeta):\n    async def __aenter__(self):\n        pass\n\n    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):\n        pass\n\n# Example usage\nclass UserSession(AsyncSession):\n    session_timeout = 30  # Timeout in seconds\n\nasync def main():\n    async with UserSession() as session:\n        # Simulate work within the session\n        await asyncio.sleep(25)\n        print(\"Session is still active\")\n\n# Run the example\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn this implementation, `session_timeout` is a decorator that adds a timeout mechanism to any class decorated with it. The `SessionMeta` metaclass applies this decorator to any class that has a `session_timeout` attribute.\n\n**Question:** What will happen if an instance of `UserSession` is used without waiting for the session to expire, and how does the `AsyncSession` class structure support this functionality?\n\nA) The session will remain active indefinitely.\nB) The session will expire after 30 seconds due to the timeout mechanism.\nC) An exception will be raised because no timeout was specified.\nD) The session will raise an error when trying to access its methods.\n\n**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nB) The session will expire after 30 seconds due to the timeout mechanism.\n\nExplanation:\nThe `AsyncSession` class uses a metaclass (`SessionMeta`) that applies a decorator (`session_timeout`) to any class it decorates. In this case, `UserSession` has a `session_timeout` attribute set to 30 seconds. When an instance of `UserSession` is used in an asynchronous context manager (i.e., within the `async with` statement), the `__aenter__` method decorated by `@session_timeout(30)` will be invoked. This method runs the session's entry logic and then waits for it to complete, timing out after 30 seconds if it has not already finished. If the session completes within the timeout period, the result is returned; otherwise, an exception is raised indicating that the session timed out.\n\nThe `AsyncSession` class structure supports this functionality by defining abstract methods (`__aenter__` and `__aexit__`) for entering and exiting the session context, respectively. These methods can be overridden in subclasses to provide specific behavior when a session begins or ends. The metaclass ensures that any subclass of `AsyncSession` will have its timeout mechanism applied automatically if it includes a `session_timeout` attribute.",

    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n\n**Correct Answer:** B\n\n**Explanation:** The code uses a metaclass (`Meta`) to automatically decorate all callable attributes of the class it creates with the `log_decorator`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created using the context manager, the `__init__` method is not explicitly defined in the class. Since Python's default behavior for creating instances involves calling `__new__` and then `__init__`, but there's no explicit `__init__`, the metaclass does not add a logging decorator to it.\n\nTherefore, when `obj.method1()` and `obj.method2(3, 4)` are called inside the context manager block:\n- The `method1` is decorated with `log_decorator`, so it logs its call before executing.\n- The `method2` is also decorated with `log_decorator`, logging its call before executing.\n\nThis results in the output:\n\n```\nCalling method1 with args: (), kwargs: {}\nExecuting method1\nCalling method2 with args: (3,), kwargs: {'b': 4}\nExecuting method2 with 3 and 4\n```",

Since each task sleeps for a time equal to its index, the total execution time will be dominated by the longest-running task (the one with the highest index). Therefore, the total execution time will be close to 4 seconds (since task 4 takes the most time).",

When a new class is defined, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called with the class name, its base classes, and a dictionary of attributes. The code in the question demonstrates that the metaclass adds a method to all classes derived from it.\n\nIn this case, when `Derived` inherits from `Base`, the `Meta.__new__` method is invoked for both `Base` and `Derived`. This means that `new_method` is added not just to `Derived` but also to any class that inherits from `Base`. Therefore, when an instance of `Derived` or any other subclass of `Base` is created, it will have access to the `new_method`.\n\nThis example shows how metaclasses can be used to add functionality across all subclasses dynamically, making them a powerful tool for advanced Python development.",

The decorator adds a small cost by recording and calculating the time before and after the function call.\n\n**B) The execution time of `compute_sum` is measured in milliseconds.**\n\n**Explanation:** This statement is incorrect because the `time.time()` function returns the current time in seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970).

    "answer": "### Part 2 (Answer)\n**Correct Answer:** C\n\n**Detailed Explanation:** \n- **Statement A is incorrect**: While `fetch_data` is defined with `async def`, it does not execute asynchronously unless called within an asynchronous context. The coroutine nature of `fetch_data` means it can pause execution at the `await asyncio.sleep(2)` line, but it won't run until scheduled in an event loop.\n- **Statement B is incorrect**: Asynchronous operations like calling a coroutine (e.g., `fetch_data()`) will not execute concurrently within a single thread unless explicitly managed using features like `asyncio.create_task` or scheduling them in different tasks. In the given code, `await fetch_data()` and `await logger.log(data)` are sequential, not concurrent.\n- **Statement C is correct**: The `AsyncLogger` class correctly implements asynchronous context management by defining the methods `__aenter__`, `log`, and `__aexit__`. This allows the class to manage resources asynchronously when used with `async with`.\n- **Statement D is incorrect**: The value of `result` will be the data returned by `fetch_data()`, which is \"Data fetched\". Therefore, `result` will not contain \"Processed result: Data fetched\"; it will simply contain \"Data fetched\".\n\nThis question tests the understanding of asynchronous programming in Python, specifically the use of coroutines and context managers for resource management.",

    "answer": "### Answer:\nA) The `cache` dictionary is not thread-safe and could lead to race conditions.\n\n**Explanation:** In this implementation, the caching mechanism uses a simple dictionary without any synchronization mechanisms. If multiple asynchronous operations are performed concurrently and access the cache simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions where two or more tasks might attempt to write to or read from the same key in the cache at the same time. This could result in incorrect data being returned or other unexpected behavior.\n\n**Correct Fix:** To resolve this issue, you should use a thread-safe caching mechanism such as `threading.Lock` for synchronous code or `asyncio.Lock` for asynchronous code to ensure that only one task can access the cache at a time. Here is an example of how you might modify the caching mechanism using `asyncio.Lock`:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nclass CacheMeta(type):\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n        cache = {}\n        lock = asyncio.Lock()\n        original_method = dct.get('fetch_data')\n\n        if original_method:\n            async def cached_method(*args, **kwargs):\n                key = args + tuple(kwargs.items())\n                async with lock:\n                    if key not in cache:\n                        cache[key] = await original_method(*args, **kwargs)\n                    return cache[key]\n            \n            dct['fetch_data'] = cached_method\n\n        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\nclass DataFetcher(metaclass=CacheMeta):\n    async def fetch_data(self, url):\n        # Simulate an HTTP request\n        await asyncio.sleep(1)\n        return f\"Data from {url}\"\n\n# Usage\nasync def main():\n    fetcher = DataFetcher()\n    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(\"http://example.com\"))\n    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(\"http://example.com\"))  # This should be fetched from cache\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nBy using `async with lock`, you ensure that only one task can execute the critical section of code (i.e., accessing or updating the cache) at a time, thus preventing race conditions and ensuring that the caching mechanism works correctly under concurrent access.",

    "answer": "B) Modify the `timer` decorator to ensure it handles functions without arguments gracefully.\n\nExplanation: The current implementation of the `timer` decorator assumes that there will always be at least one argument (`func`) passed to it. If a function decorated with `@timer` does not accept any arguments, calling this function will result in a TypeError because the wrapper will not receive any positional or keyword arguments other than those intended for the wrapped function itself.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure that our decorator can handle functions without arguments correctly. One way to do this is by modifying the `timer` decorator to check if `args` and `kwargs` are empty within the wrapper function and adjust its behavior accordingly. For example:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef timer(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = time.time()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = time.time()\n        print(f\"{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@timer\ndef compute_sum(n=1000):  # Added default argument to make the function callable without arguments\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        total += i\n    return total\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that the `compute_sum` function can be called with or without an argument, and the `timer` decorator will still work correctly.",

This instance is then invoked with `my_function()` as its argument. The `__call__` method of `MyDecorator` is what gets executed when the decorated function is called. It first prints \"Before function call\", then executes the original function, and finally prints \"After function call\".

    "answer": "A) The `AsyncTimer` class is a decorator that can be applied to any coroutine function.

This allows the coroutine `print_time` to be executed repeatedly at fixed intervals, printing the current time each time. Therefore, statement A accurately describes the behavior of the code.",

    "answer": "C) The `cache` dictionary is being created inside the decorator, leading to each decorated function having its own separate cache. This can be corrected by moving the `cache` outside the decorator.\n\nThe issue with the current implementation is that the `cache` dictionary is recreated every time the `memoize` decorator is applied to a function, resulting in each function having its own independent cache. This not only increases memory usage but also makes the memoization mechanism less effective because it does not share cached results between different instances of decorated functions.\n\nTo correct this, we need to move the `cache` dictionary outside the decorator so that it is shared across all decorated functions:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ncache = {}\n\ndef memoize(func):\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args):\n        if args in cache:\n            return cache[args]\n        else:\n            result = func(*args)\n            cache[args] = result\n            return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@memoize\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return n\n    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n```\n\nWith this change, the `cache` dictionary is shared across all instances of decorated functions, and memoization will work correctly for the `fibonacci` function.",

    "answer": "**Part 2 (Answer):**\n\nA) All tasks will start immediately upon calling `asyncio.gather` and complete concurrently.\n\nExplanation:\n- In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This means that even though asyncio allows for concurrent execution of I/O-bound tasks, CPU-bound tasks are still subject to the GIL.\n- When using `asyncio.gather`, all tasks are scheduled concurrently by asyncio's event loop. The tasks start immediately upon being passed to `asyncio.gather`.\n- Each task runs in parallel as long as it is waiting for I/O operations (like `await asyncio.sleep(delay)`). Since these tasks involve sleeping, they do not block the event loop, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.\n- Therefore, all tasks will start immediately and complete concurrently, with each waiting for its specified delay.
