**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that aims to create a decorator for asynchronous functions. The goal is to measure the execution time of an async function. However, the current implementation does not work as expected.

```python
import asyncio

def time_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def sample_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return ""Done""

# Running the function to test
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(sample_async_function())
```

What is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed?

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
B) The decorator works as expected, but the output format is incorrect.  
C) The decorator should use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):` instead of `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`.  
D) The decorator should not measure execution time for asynchronous functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
Explanation: The issue with the code lies in how the timing is being recorded. Since `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a function that provides the current time, it should be called directly to get the actual timestamp, not awaited. The correct usage would be `start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` and `end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`. This will give the current event loop's time in seconds when the function starts and ends, allowing the difference to calculate execution time.

Imagine you are developing a web application where users can upload files. You want to ensure that only specific types of files (e.g., .txt, .pdf) can be uploaded. To achieve this, you decide to use decorators and metaclasses in Python.

You create a decorator `@allowed_file_types` that checks if the file type is allowed. Then, you define a metaclass `FileTypeMeta` that automatically applies the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to any class derived from it, setting the allowed types as a parameter.

Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```python
def allowed_file_types(*types):
    def wrapper(cls):
        cls.allowed_types = types
        return cls
    return wrapper

class FileTypeMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'allowed_types' not in dct:
            dct['allowed_types'] = ()
        super_new = super(FileTypeMeta, cls).__new__
        return super_new(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AllowedFiles(metaclass=FileTypeMeta):
    pass

class TextFile(AllowedFiles):
    # TODO: Apply the allowed_file_types decorator here
    pass

# Example usage:
txt_file = TextFile()
print(txt_file.allowed_types)  # Should print ('.txt',)
```

Which of the following ways can you correctly apply the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to the `TextFile` class using the metaclass?

A) Use a direct assignment in the class definition.
B) Override the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute.
C) Use a class variable directly within the class definition.
D) Call the `@allowed_file_types` decorator directly on the class.";"Part 2 (Answer): 
A) Direct assignment is not an option because decorators are applied before the class is fully defined, and direct assignment would occur after the class is created.

B) Correct. By overriding the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute, you can ensure that any subclass of `AllowedFiles` will have its `allowed_types` attribute set by default if not explicitly provided.

C) This would work but doesn't utilize the decorator mechanism and isn't as clean or flexible as using a metaclass.

D) Calling the decorator directly on the class is also not correct because it bypasses the metaclass's influence, which should be used to set the `allowed_types` attribute."

You are developing a Python library that needs to provide thread-safe logging functionality. You want to ensure that log messages from different threads do not interfere with each other, even when they are written simultaneously. Implement a decorator that can be applied to any function to make it thread-safe using locks.

```python
import threading

# Your solution goes here

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    # Decorator code
    pass

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

Choose the correct implementation for the `thread_safe_logger` decorator:

A)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    with lock:
        print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

C)  
```python
def thread_safe_logger(func):
    lock = threading.Lock()
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

D)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            print(f""Log: {message}"")
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```";"B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

**Explanation**: The correct implementation is option B. In this solution, the `lock` is defined outside of the decorator function so that it is not recreated with each decorated function call. This ensures that all calls to the decorated functions use the same lock, making the logging thread-safe."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator to measure the execution time of any function it decorates:

```python
import time

def time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

However, there is a common pitfall with this decorator that can lead to incorrect measurements. What is the issue with this code and how would you fix it?

A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

B) The decorator captures the start time too late, leading to inaccurate timing.

C) The decorator does not allow the function to be called without any arguments.

D) The decorator does not account for recursive calls properly.";"A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

**Explanation:**
The provided decorator `time_decorator` is synchronous and will measure the total execution time of a synchronous function by capturing the start time before the function call and the end time after the function call. However, it does not account for the case where the function itself might be a coroutine (an asynchronous function). To handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly, you would need to modify the decorator to check if the decorated function is a coroutine using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`. If it is, you should use an asynchronous version of time measurement with `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete`.

A corrected version of the decorator that handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions might look like this:

```python
import asyncio
import time
import inspect

def time_decorator(func):
    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    else:
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

This version of the decorator uses conditional logic to determine whether to measure synchronous or asynchronous functions."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    async def __aenter__(self):
        print(f""Starting {self.name}"")
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        elapsed_time = time.time() - self.start_time
        print(f""{self.name} took {elapsed_time:.4f} seconds"")

async def main():
    async with Timer(""Task 1""):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
    async with Timer(""Task 2""):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.3)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `Timer` class can be used as a context manager for synchronous tasks.
B) The `Timer` class does not support asynchronous execution and will block when used in an async context.
C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.
D) Only ""Task 1"" will be able to complete successfully due to a bug.";"C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.

Explanation: The `Timer` class is designed as an asynchronous context manager, which means it can be used in an async block (`async with`). The `__aenter__` method records the start time using `time.time()` and prints a message when entering the block. The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time after exiting the block and prints it. Both tasks, ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"", will run concurrently due to their usage within an async context manager (`async with`). Therefore, both tasks will measure their execution time accurately and print it to the console."

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes dynamically:

```python
class AddMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['add_method'] = lambda self, x: x + 5
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddMethodMeta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.add_method(10))  # Output?
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.

B) The output will be an error because `add_method` is not defined in `MyClass`.

C) The output will be `None` because metaclasses do not affect method definitions.

D) The code will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot add methods dynamically.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.**

This is the correct answer. In Python, metaclasses allow you to customize class creation by modifying or extending the class definition before it's finalized. In this case, the `AddMethodMeta` metaclass dynamically adds a method named `add_method` to any class it's applied to. When we create an instance of `MyClass`, it gains access to this new method, which simply returns its argument incremented by 5.

The line `print(obj.add_method(10))` will therefore output `15`."
