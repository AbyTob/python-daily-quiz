**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that aims to create a decorator for asynchronous functions. The goal is to measure the execution time of an async function. However, the current implementation does not work as expected.

```python
import asyncio

def time_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def sample_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return ""Done""

# Running the function to test
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(sample_async_function())
```

What is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed?

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
B) The decorator works as expected, but the output format is incorrect.  
C) The decorator should use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):` instead of `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`.  
D) The decorator should not measure execution time for asynchronous functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
Explanation: The issue with the code lies in how the timing is being recorded. Since `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a function that provides the current time, it should be called directly to get the actual timestamp, not awaited. The correct usage would be `start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` and `end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`. This will give the current event loop's time in seconds when the function starts and ends, allowing the difference to calculate execution time.

Imagine you are developing a web application where users can upload files. You want to ensure that only specific types of files (e.g., .txt, .pdf) can be uploaded. To achieve this, you decide to use decorators and metaclasses in Python.

You create a decorator `@allowed_file_types` that checks if the file type is allowed. Then, you define a metaclass `FileTypeMeta` that automatically applies the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to any class derived from it, setting the allowed types as a parameter.

Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```python
def allowed_file_types(*types):
    def wrapper(cls):
        cls.allowed_types = types
        return cls
    return wrapper

class FileTypeMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'allowed_types' not in dct:
            dct['allowed_types'] = ()
        super_new = super(FileTypeMeta, cls).__new__
        return super_new(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AllowedFiles(metaclass=FileTypeMeta):
    pass

class TextFile(AllowedFiles):
    # TODO: Apply the allowed_file_types decorator here
    pass

# Example usage:
txt_file = TextFile()
print(txt_file.allowed_types)  # Should print ('.txt',)
```

Which of the following ways can you correctly apply the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to the `TextFile` class using the metaclass?

A) Use a direct assignment in the class definition.
B) Override the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute.
C) Use a class variable directly within the class definition.
D) Call the `@allowed_file_types` decorator directly on the class.";"Part 2 (Answer): 
A) Direct assignment is not an option because decorators are applied before the class is fully defined, and direct assignment would occur after the class is created.

B) Correct. By overriding the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute, you can ensure that any subclass of `AllowedFiles` will have its `allowed_types` attribute set by default if not explicitly provided.

C) This would work but doesn't utilize the decorator mechanism and isn't as clean or flexible as using a metaclass.

D) Calling the decorator directly on the class is also not correct because it bypasses the metaclass's influence, which should be used to set the `allowed_types` attribute."

You are developing a Python library that needs to provide thread-safe logging functionality. You want to ensure that log messages from different threads do not interfere with each other, even when they are written simultaneously. Implement a decorator that can be applied to any function to make it thread-safe using locks.

```python
import threading

# Your solution goes here

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    # Decorator code
    pass

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

Choose the correct implementation for the `thread_safe_logger` decorator:

A)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    with lock:
        print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

C)  
```python
def thread_safe_logger(func):
    lock = threading.Lock()
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

D)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            print(f""Log: {message}"")
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```";"B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

**Explanation**: The correct implementation is option B. In this solution, the `lock` is defined outside of the decorator function so that it is not recreated with each decorated function call. This ensures that all calls to the decorated functions use the same lock, making the logging thread-safe."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator to measure the execution time of any function it decorates:

```python
import time

def time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

However, there is a common pitfall with this decorator that can lead to incorrect measurements. What is the issue with this code and how would you fix it?

A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

B) The decorator captures the start time too late, leading to inaccurate timing.

C) The decorator does not allow the function to be called without any arguments.

D) The decorator does not account for recursive calls properly.";"A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

**Explanation:**
The provided decorator `time_decorator` is synchronous and will measure the total execution time of a synchronous function by capturing the start time before the function call and the end time after the function call. However, it does not account for the case where the function itself might be a coroutine (an asynchronous function). To handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly, you would need to modify the decorator to check if the decorated function is a coroutine using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`. If it is, you should use an asynchronous version of time measurement with `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete`.

A corrected version of the decorator that handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions might look like this:

```python
import asyncio
import time
import inspect

def time_decorator(func):
    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    else:
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

This version of the decorator uses conditional logic to determine whether to measure synchronous or asynchronous functions."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

        await asyncio.sleep(0.3)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `Timer` class can be used as a context manager for synchronous tasks.
B) The `Timer` class does not support asynchronous execution and will block when used in an async context.
C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.
D) Only ""Task 1"" will be able to complete successfully due to a bug.";"C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.

Explanation: The `Timer` class is designed as an asynchronous context manager, which means it can be used in an async block (`async with`). The `__aenter__` method records the start time using `time.time()` and prints a message when entering the block. The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time after exiting the block and prints it. Both tasks, ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"", will run concurrently due to their usage within an async context manager (`async with`). Therefore, both tasks will measure their execution time accurately and print it to the console."
"2025-04-28 00:01";"### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes dynamically:

```python
class AddMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['add_method'] = lambda self, x: x + 5
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddMethodMeta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.add_method(10))  # Output?
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.

B) The output will be an error because `add_method` is not defined in `MyClass`.

C) The output will be `None` because metaclasses do not affect method definitions.

D) The code will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot add methods dynamically.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.**

This is the correct answer. In Python, metaclasses allow you to customize class creation by modifying or extending the class definition before it's finalized. In this case, the `AddMethodMeta` metaclass dynamically adds a method named `add_method` to any class it's applied to. When we create an instance of `MyClass`, it gains access to this new method, which simply returns its argument incremented by 5.

The line `print(obj.add_method(10))` will therefore output `15`."

Which of the following statements is true about this code? Select all correct answers:

A) The metaclass `Meta` checks if the subclass has a `greet` method before allowing it to be instantiated.
B) The `greeting_decorator` modifies the `greet` method of any class it decorates, adding a greeting message at the beginning.
C) When `person.greet()` is called, it will first print ""Hello from Person"" and then ""I am a person"".
D) Both A and B are correct.";"[ANSWER] D

Explanation:
A) The metaclass `Meta` correctly checks if the subclass has a `greet` method. If not, it raises a `TypeError`, which is true.
B) The `greeting_decorator` correctly modifies the `greet` method by adding a greeting message at the beginning, which is also true.

What is the expected output of this code? Why does it behave that way?

A) The output will be 1000 because all increments are performed atomically.

B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

C) The output will be more than 1000 due to extra increments caused by thread switching.

D) The program will raise an exception due to improper use of the lock.";"B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

Explanation:
- The decorator `@thread_safe` is intended to ensure that the `increment` method of `SharedResource` is thread-safe by using a lock.
- However, the lock object is created inside the wrapper function for each call. This means that each `increment` call will use its own separate lock instead of sharing the same one across threads.
- Since each thread uses its own lock and does not block other threads from reading and writing to `value`, race conditions can still occur.
- Therefore, the final value of `resource.value` will be less than 1000, as multiple increments might be incorrectly applied."

You are tasked with creating a Python application that needs to track the creation of all instances of a certain class. You decide to use a metaclass for this purpose. Here is a partially complete code snippet:

```python

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(InstanceTracker._instances)  # Expected output: {'MyClass': [obj1, obj2]}

Which line of code should be added to the `__new__` method in the `InstanceTracker` metaclass to track the creation of instances?

A) `cls._instances[name].append(instance)`
B) `self._instances[name] = []`
C) `self._instances[name].append(self())`
D) `self._instances[name].append(new_class())`";"[ANSWER] C

Explanation:
In the provided code, we need to track the creation of instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass. The current implementation does not add any logic to track instances. 

Option A is incorrect because `instance` is not defined in the scope where this line would be executed.
Option B is incorrect because it attempts to create a new list for each class but does not append any instances to it.
Option C is correct because it appends an instance of the newly created class to a list associated with the class name. The `self()` call inside `append` creates a new instance of the class, which is then added to the list stored in `_instances`.
Option D is incorrect because it tries to append the metaclass itself rather than an instance of the class.

Adding this line to the `__new__` method will correctly track and store instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass."

B) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. After that, the program will print nothing as the timer is not running any more tasks.

C) The coroutine starts and stays alive indefinitely because the timer keeps scheduling itself to run every 3 seconds.

D) There will be an error because adding a task to the `AsyncTimer` instance does not start it immediately.";"A) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. The timer runs in an infinite loop every 3 seconds, but since there's only one task, it doesn't add any complexity.

The `run` method of the `AsyncTimer` class is designed to run indefinitely, continuously waiting for all tasks to complete before sleeping for the specified interval. Since the `my_coroutine` is added with a sleep duration of 2 seconds, it will complete after 2 seconds and then wait again for the next iteration of the timer loop (every 3 seconds).

The correct answer is D. The metaclass `Meta` dynamically adds a new attribute to each integer attribute in the class, but it only affects attributes named with a single letter ('x', 'z'). This is because when the `Meta` metaclass iterates over all attributes, it includes inherited attributes as well. In this case, since 'y' is not an integer, no additional attribute is added for it. The '__new__' method of the metaclass is included in the class dictionary because metaclasses define their own `__new__` method to create and return a new class object."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) When `MyClass` is defined, it does not raise any errors.
B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.
C) The metaclass `Meta` can be used to enforce that all classes inheriting from `MyClass` must also define an attribute `x`.
D) The metaclass `Meta` cannot be instantiated directly.";"B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because the code does not run without errors. It raises a `TypeError` during class creation.
- Option C is incorrect because metaclasses like `Meta` control the creation of classes, not their inheritance.
- Option D is correct because a metaclass itself is just a class that inherits from `type`, and it can be instantiated as any other class.
- Option B is correct. The metaclass `Meta` checks if the attribute `x` is present in the class dictionary when the class is being created. If it's not, it raises a `TypeError`."

You are tasked with creating a context manager that logs the time taken for each block of code it decorates. However, you want this logging to be performed asynchronously, so that it does not block the main execution flow. Your task is to design such a context manager using Python's `asyncio` library.

Here's a partially implemented version of your context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f""Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds"")

# Example usage:
async def main():
    async with AsyncTimerContextManager() as timer:
        # Simulate some asynchronous work
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print(""Work completed!"")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

However, this code has an issue: it does not correctly handle exceptions that might occur within the `with` block. You need to ensure that any exceptions raised inside the `with` block are propagated and handled by the caller of `async with`.

What change should you make to the `AsyncTimerContextManager` class to correctly propagate exceptions?

A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

B) Wrap the code that calculates and logs the duration in a try-except block.

C) Remove the `return self` statement from the `__aenter__` method.

D) Change the `log_time_taken` method to be an instance method instead of a static method.";"A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

The correct answer is A. In the `__aexit__` method, you should add a condition to check if an exception occurred (`if exc_type`). If an exception did occur, you should re-raise it using `raise exc_val from exc_tb`. This ensures that any exceptions raised within the `with` block are propagated and handled correctly by the caller of `async with`.

Here's the corrected version of the context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        if exc_type is None:
            await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)
        else:
            raise exc_val from exc_tb

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f""Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds"")

# Example usage remains the same
```

This implementation ensures that exceptions are correctly propagated, allowing for proper error handling in the code using the context manager."

A) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", followed by ""Task 2 started"", then ""Task 1 finished"", and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

B) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 1 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

C) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", followed by ""Task 2 started"", and both tasks will finish concurrently without waiting for the other.

D) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 2 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, but ""Task 1 finished"" will not print because it takes longer to complete.";"B) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 1 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

Explanation: 
- The `asyncio.gather` function runs multiple coroutines concurrently.
- When both tasks start, they print their start messages immediately.
- However, since `task2` completes first (after 1 second), its completion is printed next.
- After a total of 2 seconds, the completion of `task1` is printed."

A) True  
B) False  
C) The code will raise an error  
D) None of the above";"**Answer:** A) True

**Explanation:**  
The provided metaclass, `SingletonMeta`, ensures that only one instance of any class using it can be created. In this case, when `db1` and `db2` are instantiated from the `Database` class, the `__call__` method of the metaclass is invoked. Since `_instances[cls]` is checked for `SingletonMeta`, and since no other instance exists in `_instances`, both `db1` and `db2` will reference the same instance stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`."

Which of the following statements is true about the `counter` decorator and the `my_function` when it's decorated?

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

B) The `wrapper` function does not have access to the `count` attribute because it is a local variable in the `counter` function.

C) Each call to `my_function` creates a new instance of the `counter` decorator.

D) When `my_function` is decorated, the `func.count` attribute is set to 1 immediately and then incremented by 1 each time the function is called.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

Explanation:
- A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it. In this case, the `counter` decorator is designed to keep track of how many times the decorated function (`my_function`) has been called.
- The `wrapper` function inside the `counter` decorator has access to all non-local variables, including those defined in enclosing functions. Therefore, it can modify the `count` attribute which was set on the original function object when it was passed to the decorator.
- Each call to `my_function()` increments the `count` by 1, demonstrating that the `func.count` attribute is indeed being updated correctly with each invocation.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

B) The use of `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` inside the wrapper function is incorrect and will raise an error.

C) The `@time_decorator` syntax applies the decorator to any synchronous or asynchronous function without modification.

D) The execution time measurement is accurate but can be improved by using a more precise timer.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

Explanation: The code uses `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` to get the current time asynchronously, which is appropriate for measuring the execution time of an asyncio function. This method ensures that the timing does not interfere with other tasks running in the event loop. The decorator works as intended and provides accurate execution time measurements for asynchronous functions."

What is the output when running this code?

A) The file 'example.txt' will be created with ""Hello, World!"" inside.
B) ""Executing open_file"" will be printed before the file is written to.
C) An error will occur because decorators cannot be used with context managers.
D) ""Executing open_file"" will not be printed.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The file 'example.txt' will be created with ""Hello, World!"" inside.

Explanation: Decorators and context managers are separate concepts in Python. While you can use a decorator on any callable, including a function used within a context manager, the decorators themselves do not interfere with the behavior of the context manager. In this example, `log_decorator` is applied to `open_file`, but since it does not modify the behavior of opening or closing the file (only logs that the function is being executed), the file operations will still occur as expected.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) The `my_decorator` will only execute before the `say_hello()` function, not when accessing the `my_property`.

Explanation:
In Python, decorators can be applied to methods in classes. However, when a property is accessed, it does not pass through the decorator because properties have their own getter, setter, and deleter methods associated with them. In this case, the `@property` decorator applies the `my_decorator` only to the getter method of `my_property`. Therefore, the message ""Something is happening before the function is called."" will be printed when accessing `obj.my_property`, but ""Something is happening after the function is called."" will not be printed because the decorator does not apply to the setter or deleter methods."

B) The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator wraps `my_async_function` in a way that it can be used with `asyncio.run()`.

**Explanation:**
The `@AsyncDecorator` class is designed to accept an asynchronous function (`my_async_function`) and simply call it. This does not change the fact that `my_async_function` is still an async function, meaning it requires proper execution through an event loop like `asyncio.run()`. Thus, using `@AsyncDecorator` does not alter the fundamental nature of `my_async_function`; it remains a coroutine, which can only be executed in an asyncio context. Therefore, calling `my_async_function()` directly outside of an async context or without wrapping it in an appropriate event loop will raise an error unless `my_async_function` is defined as a regular function rather than an async one."

You are tasked with optimizing a Python script that involves frequent I/O operations. The current implementation uses synchronous file handling, which is blocking and affects the performance of the application.

To optimize this, you decide to use asynchronous file handling with `asyncio`. However, your script also needs to maintain state across multiple asynchronous tasks without using global variables or mutable shared data structures.

Which of the following approaches would be most suitable for maintaining state between asynchronous tasks while optimizing I/O operations?

A) Using a class-based state management system that inherits from `asyncio.Lock` and handles all state transitions asynchronously

B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup

C) Implementing a custom metaclass that tracks state across asynchronous tasks by intercepting attribute access and modification

D) Creating a global dictionary to store state information, which is thread-safe due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup**

This approach is the most suitable for several reasons:
1. **State Management**: `AsyncExitStack` allows you to manage multiple asynchronous context managers efficiently, ensuring that resources are cleaned up properly even if an exception occurs.
2. **Concurrency Safety**: By using `asyncio.Queue`, you can safely share state across tasks without worrying about race conditions or synchronization issues, making the system more robust and scalable.
3. **Asynchronous Operations**: Since both `AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` are asynchronous constructs, they integrate seamlessly with other asynchronous components of your application, improving overall performance and responsiveness.

The other options have limitations:
- **Option A** uses `asyncio.Lock`, which is more for synchronization rather than state management.
- **Option C**, while it might be interesting, introduces unnecessary complexity and potential issues related to maintaining state in a metaclass, especially since metaclasses are not directly designed for this purpose.
- **Option D** relies on the GIL, which would limit performance gains from asynchronous programming, as it doesn't take advantage of multiple cores or threads effectively."

Which of the following is the correct diagnosis for why `MyClass` instances do not log method calls as expected?

A) The metaclass's `__new__` method is incorrectly overriding the class dictionary.

B) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.

C) Using `setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))` modifies the class dictionary in an unintended way.

D) The `wrapper` function inside `log_method` is incorrectly capturing its arguments.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.

The issue with the provided code is that the `log_method` static method is intended to return a new callable that logs when the wrapped method is called. However, it incorrectly modifies the `wrapper` function's closure by using `*args, **kwargs`, which prevents it from capturing the correct arguments and keyword arguments of the original method.

To fix this, one should avoid modifying the `wrapper` function in-place within `log_method`. A better approach would be to define a new callable object that captures the original method and its signature correctly. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f""Creating class {name}"")
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():

                setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

A) The `__len__` method will return 0 because it does not count attributes.

B) The `__len__` method will raise an error because it cannot determine attribute counts dynamically.

C) The `__len__` method will return 2 because it correctly counts the instance attributes.

D) The behavior of the `MyClass` instances will be unchanged as no additional methods were added.

### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct answer: C) The `__len__` method will return 2 because it correctly counts the instance attributes.**

**Explanation:** The metaclass `AutoLenMeta` dynamically adds a `__len__` method to any class it decorates. This method returns the number of items in the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which typically includes all non-private attributes of the class (i.e., those not starting with an underscore). Therefore, when `MyClass` is created, the `__len__` method will return 2, as there are two attributes (`a` and `b`) in the `MyClass`. The lambda function used for `__len__` counts all items directly from the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which correctly reflects the number of instance attributes.";"Answer format error.

B) Method '__init__' called with args: (), kwargs: {}  
   38

C) Method '__init__' called with args: (10, 20), kwargs: {}  
   Method 'add' called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}

D) Error: __new__() got multiple values for argument 'name'

**Part 2 (Answer):**
C) Method '__init__' called with args: (10, 20), kwargs: {}  
   Method 'add' called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}  
   40

**Explanation:** 
When `MyClass` is instantiated, the metaclass `LogMethodCalls` logs the call to the `__init__` method before executing it. After `__init__` is called, when `obj.add(5, 3)` is executed, the `add` method is also logged by the `LogMethodCalls` metaclass. The expected output includes both the log statements and the result of the `add` method call, which is 40."

print(instance1 == instance2)  # Output: ?
print(instance1.value)       # Output: ?

What will be the output of `instance1 == instance2` and `instance1.value` when the code is executed?

A. True, 10  
B. False, 10  
C. True, 20  
D. False, 20";"A. True, 10  

Explanation: The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created, no matter how many times it is instantiated. When `instance1 = create_instance(10)` is executed, an instance with `value=10` is created and stored in `_instances`. Then, when `instance2 = create_instance(20)` is called, the existing instance from `_instances` (which has `value=10`) is returned. Therefore, `instance1 == instance2` evaluates to True because they refer to the same object. Additionally, since both instances are the same, `instance1.value` also returns 10."

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to modify the behavior of a class method:

```python
from functools import wraps

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):

# Create an instance of MyClass and call its method
obj = MyClass(10)

What will be the output of this code when executed? Explain how decorators work in this context.

A) ""Calling get_value with args=(), kwargs={}

""10""

C) TypeError: get_value() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'

D) None";"A) ""Calling get_value with args=(), kwargs={}

Explanation: In this example, a decorator named `log_method_calls` is defined to log the calls to methods it decorates. The `wrapper` function inside the decorator logs the method name and its arguments before calling the original method. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and the `get_value` method is called, the output shows that the method was successfully logged with no arguments passed (as `self` is automatically passed by Python when a method is called on an instance), followed by the return value of the method call."

C) The tasks run concurrently, and all three finish within about 3 seconds.

Explanation:
The `asyncio.gather` function is used to run multiple coroutines concurrently. In this example, 'A', 'B', and 'C' start at the same time, and each task has a different sleep duration. Task 'A' sleeps for 1 second, 'B' for 2 seconds, and 'C' for 3 seconds.

Implement a decorator that measures the execution time of a coroutine. The decorator should be able to handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions. Use `asyncio` for asynchronous timing.

Here is a partial implementation to help you get started:

    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()

sync_function = measure_time(lambda: time.sleep(1))

# Call both the synchronous and asynchronous functions to see their execution times.
sync_function()
asyncio.run(async_function())

Which of the following statements is true regarding the implementation above?

A) The `measure_time` decorator works correctly for both synchronous and asynchronous functions but it fails when applied to synchronous functions.

B) The `measure_time` decorator is fully functional for both types of functions and will accurately measure their execution times.

C) The `wrapper` function in the decorator incorrectly measures time due to a mistake in capturing start and end times.

D) The `async_function` can be called directly without using `await`, but it will not trigger the execution time measurement because of its `@measure_time` decorator.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
B) The `measure_time` decorator is fully functional for both types of functions and will accurately measure their execution times.

The implementation uses `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` to capture the current loop time, which works correctly whether the function being measured is synchronous or asynchronous. For synchronous functions, calling `await asyncio.sleep(1)` in a coroutine context effectively pauses the event loop for 1 second while still allowing other tasks to run, thus accurately measuring the execution time.";"Answer format error.

D) The use of `@wraps(cls)` in the decorator is unnecessary and causing issues.

Part 2 (Answer):
B) Both the metaclass and the decorator are incorrectly trying to manage instances.

Explanation:
The issue with the provided code lies in its attempt to combine singleton patterns using both a metaclass (`SingletonMeta`) and a decorator (`singleton`). Each of these methods tries to manage the instance creation, leading to conflicts when an instance is created through one method (metaclass) and later attempted again through another (decorator). The correct approach would be to use either the metaclass or the decorator but not both. If using a metaclass, it should handle all instance creation logic within its `__call__` method. If using a decorator, it should manage instances outside of class definitions and apply it to methods that need to return singleton instances rather than applying it directly to the class.";"Answer format error.

A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.

B) The decorator uses a closure to capture and modify the behavior of the original function.

C) The `wrapper` function inside the `timer` decorator directly replaces `compute_sum`.

D) The execution time is printed only once, outside of the function call in `compute_sum`.";"A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.

**Explanation:** 
Option A is correct. In Python, decorators are functions that take another function and extend its behavior without explicitly modifying it. The `wrapper` function captures the execution time by recording the start and end times around the call to the original function `func`. This extended behavior is then returned when `compute_sum` is called.

**Option B:**
While the decorator does use a closure, this is not what makes it modify the original function. A closure only affects how variables are bound within nested functions. The modification happens through the way the `wrapper` function is defined and returned by the `timer` decorator.

**Option C:**
This statement is incorrect because the `wrapper` function does not replace `compute_sum`. Instead, it wraps around `compute_sum` to add the timing functionality.

**Option D:**
The execution time is printed inside the `wrapper` function each time `compute_sum` is called. It is not a one-time print outside of the function call."

Explanation: The correct answer is B. The metaclass `AutoReprMeta` dynamically adds a `__repr__` method to any class it decorates, which in this case is `MyClass`. This method returns a string formatted as ""ClassName(instance_id)"", where `instance_id` is the memory address of the instance, as returned by Python's built-in `id()` function.

D) The decorator will cause a stack overflow due to excessive recursion when used with large inputs.

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]  
**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When applied to `compute_sum`, the decorator will print the execution time without modifying its return value.

Explanation: The provided decorator, `timing_decorator`, is correctly implemented. It measures the time taken by the function it decorates (`func`) and prints this duration. However, it does not modify the return value of the function being decorated. Therefore, when `compute_sum(100000)` is called with the `@timing_decorator` applied, it will print the execution time and then return the result of `sum(range(1))`, which is 5000050000, as expected.

The decorator can be used with coroutine functions without issues. However, in Python, decorators are not directly applicable to coroutines due to differences in how they are executed and awaited, so attempting to use a timing decorator on a coroutine would not raise an error but would likely not function as intended.

**Explanation:**  
The decorator `async_if_docstring_contains_async` checks if the docstring of a function contains the word ""async"". If it does, the function is decorated with `asyncio.coroutine`, which converts it into an asynchronous function. In the given code, the subclass `Derived` inherits from `Base`. Since `method_with_async_in_docstring` has a docstring containing ""async"", it will be converted to an asynchronous method when it is accessed via an instance of `Derived`. On the other hand, `method_without_async_in_docstring`, even though it's defined as an async method in the class definition, does not have the required word ""async"" in its docstring.

# What will be the result of calling `create_instance()`?
A) True
B) False
C) TypeError
D) SyntaxError";"A) True

Explanation: 
The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can ever be created. When you call `create_instance()`, it attempts to create two instances of `MyClass`. Due to the singleton pattern enforced by the metaclass, both `obj1` and `obj2` will refer to the same object in memory, making the comparison `obj1 is obj2` evaluate to `True`."

A) ""Class MyClass is being created"" will be printed, and then a TypeError will occur because `MyClass` cannot be used as a context manager.
B) ""Class MyClass is being created"" will be printed, and then an instance of `MyClass` will be created without any errors.
C) A NameError will occur because the `with` statement requires an object that implements the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
D) The code will not run as there is a syntax error in defining the `Meta` metaclass.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A) ""Class MyClass is being created"" will be printed, and then a TypeError will occur because `MyClass` cannot be used as a context manager.

Explanation: The `with` statement requires that the object passed to it implements the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. Since `Meta` does not define these methods, attempting to use `MyClass` with a `with` statement results in a TypeError even though the metaclass logs the creation of the class as intended."

A) The `Timer` class will always print a timing that is exactly the same as what `timed_function` prints.

B) Both `timed_function` and `Timer` are decorators, but they can be used interchangeably.

C) The `Timer` context manager will provide more precise timing than the `timed_function`.

D) The `timed_function` decorator is applied to the function inside the `with Timer()` block.

### Part 2 (Answer)
**";"C) The `Timer` context manager will provide more precise timing than the `timed_function`.**

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Option A:** Incorrect. While both decorators and context managers can be used for timing, the `Timer` class provides more precision due to its use of the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, which are called at the exact start and end of the block respectively.
  
- **Option B:** Correct. Both `timed_function` and `Timer` can be used as decorators, but they serve different purposes. The decorator is useful for adding functionality to existing functions without changing their interface, while the context manager provides a way to manage resources (like file handles or timers) in a more controlled manner.
  
- **Option C:** Correct. The `Timer` class offers more precision because it measures the time between the exact entry and exit of the block where it is used. This eliminates any overhead that might be incurred by function calls, providing a more accurate timing.

- **Option D:** Incorrect. The `timed_function` decorator is applied to the `long_running_task` function before entering the context manager block with `Timer()`. Thus, the decorator's timing will include the time spent both inside and outside the `with Timer()` block."

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `log_decorator` will not be applied to any methods.

B) The `enter` and `exit` methods will be logged before and after their execution.

C) The `ContextManager` class must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods for the context manager to work correctly.

D) There will be a runtime error because `Meta` does not properly delegate the implementation of `__enter__` and `__exit__`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The `ContextManager` class must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods for the context manager to work correctly.

The correct answer is C. Here's why:

- In the provided code, the `Meta` metaclass checks if `enter` and `exit` methods are defined in any subclass of `ContextManager`. If they are, it replaces them with decorated versions using `log_decorator`.
- For a class to be usable as a context manager, it must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. The `Meta` metaclass ensures that these methods are present before replacing them with the decorated versions.
- If the subclass does not define either method, they will remain unmodified, but the context manager will still be valid as long as other necessary methods (like `__init__`) are implemented.

Options A, B, and D are incorrect:
- A is wrong because `log_decorator` is applied to both the original `enter` and `exit` methods.
- B is not entirely correct because the decorator only logs the method calls if they exist in the subclass. If either `enter` or `exit` is missing, it won't be logged.
- D is incorrect because there is no issue with how `Meta` handles the methods; it correctly checks and decorates them if present."
"2025-05-12 00:02";"";"**Part 1 (Question):**
Implement a metaclass that allows only one instance of any class it decorates. This metaclass should also ensure that attempting to create another instance results in raising an exception with the message ""Only one instance allowed"". Use this metaclass on a simple class `Singleton`.

```python
# Your code here

class Singleton:
    pass

# Example usage:
instance1 = Singleton()
print(instance1)  # Should print the singleton instance

try:
    instance2 = Singleton()  # This should raise an exception

        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Example usage remains the same
```

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The correct implementation is option B. This metaclass uses a class variable `_instance` to store the instance of the class when it is first created. Any subsequent attempts to create an instance will return this stored instance, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists.

Option A and D are essentially the same, storing all instances in a dictionary `_instances`, which could lead to issues if multiple different classes use this metaclass. Option C incorrectly tries to modify the class definition during creation using `__new__`, which is not necessary for this functionality."

What does the code do when executed? What are the expected outputs?

A) The program creates two instances of `MyClass`, each with a delay of 1 and 2 seconds respectively. It then prints the values and counts.

B) The program creates one instance of `MyClass` and prints its value twice, followed by the count of instances.

C) An error occurs because async methods cannot be added to classes using metaclasses.

D) The program crashes due to a misuse of asyncio.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

A) The program creates two instances of `MyClass`, each with a delay of 1 and 2 seconds respectively. It then prints the values and counts.

**Explanation:** 
The metaclass `Meta` is used to add an instance counter to the class, which increments every time a new instance of `MyClass` is created. The async method `async_method` is dynamically added to `MyClass` using the `__get__` method of the coroutine function to bind it correctly to the class methods. When run, the program creates two instances of `MyClass`, and each prints its value after a delay followed by the total count of instances created."

Which of the following statements correctly describes how and why this metaclass works?

A) The metaclass dynamically defines a new method `hello_world` during class creation.

B) The `__new__` method is overridden to manually add the method to each instance.

C) The metaclass uses a decorator to modify the class after it's created.

D) The `hello_world` method is added to instances of `MyClass`, not to the class itself.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The metaclass dynamically defines a new method `hello_world` during class creation.

Explanation: In Python, metaclasses are essentially classes that create other classes. When a class is defined using a metaclass, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called with the class name, base classes, and class dictionary as arguments. Inside this method, we can modify or extend the class dictionary to include additional methods, attributes, or even dynamically define new methods. In this case, the `Meta` metaclass adds a lambda function named `hello_world` that prints ""Hello, World!"" whenever it is called.

The other options are incorrect:
- B) The method is added directly to the class itself through the metaclass.
- C) This refers to decorators, which modify functions or methods after they are defined, not during class creation.
- D) The method is added to the class, not instances of the class."

You are tasked with creating a decorator that can be used to measure the execution time of any function it decorates. The decorator should handle asynchronous functions as well as synchronous ones. However, you've encountered an issue: when applying the decorator to an async function, it doesn't work correctly due to the way decorators are typically applied.

Here's a code snippet that attempts to create such a decorator:

```python
import time

def measure_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

The code does not work as expected for an async function. Modify the `measure_time` decorator so that it can handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly.

A) Provide a solution that works for both types of functions.
B) Explain why the original implementation fails for async functions.
C) Suggest a way to modify the decorator to accommodate both cases without significantly altering its structure.";"[A] The modified `measure_time` decorator should use Python's `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` to check if the decorated function is an async function. If it is, the decorator should measure time differently by using `await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(None, func)` inside a coroutine.

[B] The original implementation fails for async functions because it calls the function directly without awaiting it when it's an async function. This leads to the measurement starting before the function actually starts running and ending before it finishes, resulting in incorrect timing.

[C] To accommodate both synchronous and asynchronous functions, the decorator can be modified to check if the wrapped function is an async function using `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)`. If it is, the decorator should measure time by awaiting the function inside a coroutine. Otherwise, it should proceed as before:

```python
import asyncio
import time

def measure_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func):

You are tasked with creating a decorator that measures the execution time of a function, but this time you want to ensure that it is only applied to functions within specific classes. To achieve this, you decide to use both decorators and metaclasses.

Here's your starting point:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimeMeasuringMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith(""__""):
                dct[attr_name] = timing_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class TimeMeasuringClass(metaclass=TimeMeasuringMeta):
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(1.0)

# Example usage:
tm = TimeMeasuringClass()
tm.method1()  # Should print execution time
tm.method2()  # Should print execution time
```

You want to ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods of classes defined with `TimeMeasuringMeta`. However, you also notice that applying decorators directly to method definitions within a class might not be as clean or flexible as using metaclasses. Your task is to modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass so that it applies the `timing_decorator` only to methods where the decorator is explicitly specified.

**Question:** How can you modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass to ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods where it is explicitly specified, such as by using a custom attribute or annotation?

A) By checking for a specific attribute or annotation on each method during the metaclass's `__new__` method
B) By dynamically adding the decorator to methods at runtime within the class definition
C) By overriding the `__getattribute__` method of the metaclass to apply the decorator conditionally
D) By using a custom decorator that checks for its application within the metaclass";"[ANSWER]
A) By checking for a specific attribute or annotation on each method during the metaclass's `__new__` method

Explanation:
To ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods where it is explicitly specified, you can modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass by adding logic in its `__new__` method to check for a specific attribute or annotation on each method. If this attribute or annotation is present, apply the decorator; otherwise, leave the method unchanged. This approach allows for fine-grained control over which methods are decorated and can be easily extended to accommodate different ways of specifying that a method should be timed."

You are tasked with creating a Python decorator that can be applied to both functions and class methods. The decorator should log the function call details including the arguments passed, but it should handle both regular functions and static/class methods correctly. Implement this decorator and demonstrate its usage on a sample function and a class method.

```python
# Decorator implementation

    return a + b

# Example usage of the decorator on a class method

    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y

# Test cases
result_add = add(3, 4)
print(result_add)  # Output should be 7 with logged call details

calc = Calculator()
result_multiply = calc.multiply(5, 6)
print(result_multiply)  # Output should be 30 with logged call details
```

### Part 2 (Answer)
**";"A**

**Detailed Explanation:** 
The correct answer involves creating a decorator that can handle both regular functions and static/class methods. This requires using the `functools.wraps` to preserve the original function's metadata and checking if the wrapped method is an instance method, class method, or static method.

Here is a possible implementation of the `log_calls` decorator:

```python
import functools

def log_calls(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if inspect.ismethod(wrapper) and not isinstance(wrapper, staticmethod):
            instance = args[0]
            method_name = func.__name__
            args = args[1:]
        else:
            instance = None
            method_name = func.__qualname__
        
        print(f""Calling {method_name} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f""{method_name} returned {result}"")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Example usage of the decorator on a function
@log_calls
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example usage of the decorator on a class method
class Calculator:
    @staticmethod
    @log_calls
    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y

# Test cases
result_add = add(3, 4)
print(result_add)  # Output should be 7 with logged call details

calc = Calculator()
result_multiply = calc.multiply(5, 6)
print(result_multiply)  # Output should be 30 with logged call details
```

This implementation uses `inspect.ismethod` to differentiate between instance methods and static/class methods. For instance methods, it adjusts the arguments list by removing the first argument which is the instance itself.

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import threading

def thread_safe(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with threading.Lock():
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1

    def get_value(self):
        return self.value

def main():
    counter = Counter()
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=counter.increment) for _ in range(100)]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

    print(counter.get_value())

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and implications of this code?

A) The `Counter` class is thread-safe without using any decorators or locks.
B) The `thread_safe` decorator ensures that the `increment` method can be safely called from multiple threads, but it does not protect other methods like `get_value`.
C) The use of threading in this code guarantees that the counter will always display a value of 100.
D) The `Counter` class will raise an exception due to concurrent access issues.

### Part 2 (Answer)
B) The `thread_safe` decorator ensures that the `increment` method can be safely called from multiple threads, but it does not protect other methods like `get_value`.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- The `thread_safe` decorator is applied to the `Counter` class to ensure thread safety. It wraps each method in a lock context manager, which means that only one thread can execute any of the wrapped methods at a time.
  
- However, this protection does not extend to other methods like `get_value`. If another method were to access or modify the state without using the lock, it could lead to race conditions even though `increment` is protected.

- In the given code, each thread calls `increment`, which is protected by the lock. Since no other threads can call `increment` at the same time, there will be no data corruption for incrementing the counter. However, calling `get_value` from multiple threads simultaneously could lead to race conditions unless additional synchronization measures are taken.

- Therefore, option B accurately describes that while the `thread_safe` decorator makes `increment` thread-safe, it does not cover all methods in the `Counter` class.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a singleton pattern using metaclasses:

        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

# Example usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Should print True
print(obj1.value)
```

Which of the following statements about this code is incorrect?

A. The `SingletonMeta` metaclass correctly implements the singleton pattern.
B. Instances of `MyClass` are created only once, ensuring that `obj1` and `obj2` refer to the same object.
C. The `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` checks if an instance already exists before creating a new one.
D. The `value` attribute is correctly set for both `obj1` and `obj2`.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A. The statement ""The `SingletonMeta` metaclass correctly implements the singleton pattern"" is incorrect.

Explanation: While `SingletonMeta` does ensure that only one instance of `MyClass` is created, it uses a class-level dictionary `_instances` to store instances. This approach might not be thread-safe in a multi-threaded environment where multiple threads could potentially create instances simultaneously before any have been added to the dictionary. A more robust solution would involve using threading locks or atomic operations to ensure thread safety when checking and setting `_instances`."

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The decorator `log_resource_access` ensures that the `access_database` function can only be called once.

B) When `access_database` is decorated with `@log_resource_access`, it logs entering and exiting the function, and then executes the actual database access logic.

C) The decorator `log_resource_access` will cause a syntax error when applied to any function.

D) Calling `access_database()` will not output any messages because the decorator does nothing.";"### Answer:
B) When `access_database` is decorated with `@log_resource_access`, it logs entering and exiting the function, and then executes the actual database access logic.

**Explanation:**
- The decorator `log_resource_access` wraps the original `access_database` function to add logging functionality before and after its execution.
- Inside the `wrapper` function, the message ""Entering {func.__name__}"" is printed when entering the function, followed by the execution of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, which performs the actual database access. Afterward, the message ""Exiting {func.__name__}"" is printed to indicate that the function has exited.
- This allows for monitoring and debugging purposes without modifying the original function logic."

C) The `Timer` class accurately measures the time taken by both synchronous and asynchronous operations within its `async with` block.
D) The `Timer` class is not thread-safe.";"[ANSWER] C) The `Timer` class accurately measures the time taken by both synchronous and asynchronous operations within its `async with` block.

**Explanation:**
- The `Timer` class uses Python's `asyncio.sleep()` in its `main()` function, which is an asynchronous operation. 
- The `Timer` class defines both `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods, making it a context manager that works with the `async with` statement.
- When using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`, Python's event loop is not blocked, allowing other tasks to run concurrently. This demonstrates that the `Timer` class can accurately measure both synchronous (like time.sleep) and asynchronous operations.
- The example correctly shows how to use an asynchronous context manager (`async with`) with a function that involves asynchronous sleep, making option C the correct answer."

A) The `log_arguments` decorator correctly logs both positional and keyword arguments for any method it decorates.

B) When `add(2, 3)` is called on an instance of `Calculator`, it will print ""Arguments: (2, 3), Keyword Arguments: {}"" before returning the result of the addition.

C) The `wrapper` function in the decorator replaces the original method's signature, leading to potential issues when the method's signature needs to be preserved.

D) The `log_arguments` decorator can be used on any method that does not require access to the instance (`self`) or class (`cls`) of the object it is called on.";"B) When `add(2, 3)` is called on an instance of `Calculator`, it will print ""Arguments: (2, 3), Keyword Arguments: {}"" before returning the result of the addition.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because while the decorator correctly logs positional arguments, it does not log keyword arguments when they are provided.
- Option C is partially correct but misleading. The `wrapper` function does not replace the original method's signature; instead, it simply adds logging functionality around the method call without altering its interface.
- Option D is incorrect because if a method is decorated with `log_arguments`, it will receive an additional positional argument (`self`) when called as a class method, which might cause errors or unexpected behavior unless explicitly handled in the decorator."

B) All `fetch_data` calls are made sequentially, waiting for each to complete before starting the next.
C) The use of `asyncio.gather` allows all `fetch_data` calls to run concurrently, significantly speeding up the fetching process.
D) There is no error handling mechanism in place if a URL fails to fetch data.";"[ANSWER]
C) The use of `asyncio.gather` allows all `fetch_data` calls to run concurrently, significantly speeding up the fetching process.

Explanation:
- **Option A and B** are incorrect because the code uses `asyncio.gather`, which runs all tasks concurrently. Each task (each call to `fetch_data`) is scheduled and started immediately after the previous one, but they don't wait for each other. Therefore, multiple URLs' data can be fetched at the same time.
- **Option C** is correct as `asyncio.gather` takes an iterable of coroutines (`tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in self.urls]`) and schedules them to run concurrently. This results in all `fetch_data` calls starting almost immediately and finishing in parallel, which can significantly reduce the total time needed to fetch data from multiple URLs.
- **Option D** is not addressed in the provided code. While it's generally a good practice to include error handling when dealing with network requests or external services, this specific question does not touch upon that aspect of the code."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `WebServer` class can be instantiated and its methods called directly without any issues.

B) Calling `asyncio.run(web_server.start())` will cause a runtime error because `web_server.start()` is an async method and should not be awaited directly inside `run_server`.

C) The server listens on the specified host and port, handles client connections asynchronously, and echoes back the received data in uppercase.

D) None of the above";"C) The server listens on the specified host and port, handles client connections asynchronously, and echoes back the received data in uppercase.

Explanation:
- The `WebServer` class is properly defined with an asynchronous method `handle_request` to handle incoming client requests.
- The `start` method sets up and starts the asyncio server, which correctly awaits the `serve_forever()` call.
- When `asyncio.run(web_server.start())` is called in `run_server`, it executes the async function as expected, without awaiting it directly inside another async function or coroutine. This is valid because `asyncio.run()` takes care of running the main entry point for asyncio programs.

B) The `get_data()` function will run synchronously and block the event loop.

C) The `@FetchDecorator` measures the time taken by `fetch_data()` and prints it out.

D) The `@FetchDecorator` is designed to work with synchronous functions only.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**C) The @FetchDecorator measures the time taken by fetch_data() and prints it out.**

Explanation:

The provided code defines a coroutine `get_data()` that uses another coroutine `fetch_data()`. The decorator `FetchDecorator` is applied to `get_data()`, which adds timing functionality around its execution.

When `get_data()` is called, it wraps the call to `fetch_data()` with timing logic. Inside the `__call__` method of the decorator, the start time is recorded before calling the decorated function (`self.func`). After the function returns, the end time is recorded, and the difference (time taken) is printed out.

This allows you to measure and print how long it takes for `fetch_data()` to execute, which demonstrates that the decorator works correctly with asynchronous functions."

B) The `attribute` starts at 1 and is incremented every time `increment()` is called.

C) The `attribute` is incremented correctly on the first call to `increment()`, but subsequent calls have no effect.

D) The code does not compile because it attempts to modify a class attribute inside a metaclass method.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `attribute` is incremented every time `increment()` is called, but it will always start from 0 for each new instance.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` sets the default value of `attribute` to 0 when the class is initialized.
- The decorator `modify_attribute` increments the `attribute` by 1 each time the decorated method `increment()` is called.
- Since `attribute` is a class attribute, it is shared among all instances of the class. However, in this specific code structure, it behaves as if it were incremented only once per instance because the increment happens every time an instance calls its own `increment()` method, not the original implementation in the metaclass."

D) There is no issue with the current implementation; it correctly measures the execution time of async functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The `wrapper` function does not properly handle exceptions raised by the decorated async function.

Explanation:
In the provided code, if an exception occurs within the `my_async_function`, it will not be caught and propagated. To fix this, the `wrapper` function should be modified to catch exceptions and re-raise them after printing the execution time. Here's how you can correct it:

try:
    loop.run_until_complete(my_async_function())
except Exception as e:

Imagine you are developing a library that needs to manage resources efficiently. You decide to create a context manager that automatically handles the opening and closing of files, but also ensures that each file is only opened once even if multiple parts of your code attempt to open it simultaneously.

Here's an example implementation using a context manager:

```python
class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
        self.file = None

    async def open(self):
        if not self.file:

    async def read(self):
        if self.file:
            return await self.file.read()
        else:
            raise IOError(""File is not opened"")

    async def close(self):
        if self.file:
            await self.file.close()
            self.file = None

async def manage_file(filename):

    finally:
        await manager.close()
```

However, you notice that this approach is not thread-safe because multiple threads could potentially attempt to open the same file simultaneously. To fix this, you decide to use a decorator to ensure that only one thread can execute the `open` method at a time.

Here's your task:  
1. Implement a thread-safe version of the `FileManager` class using a decorator.
2. Explain how this solution ensures thread safety and why it is effective.";"[A] The solution uses the `threading.Lock()` to ensure that only one thread can execute the `open` method at a time, making it thread-safe. This is effective because it prevents multiple threads from opening and closing the file simultaneously, which could lead to data corruption or other issues.

[B] The decorator ensures that each file is only opened once by using a class variable to track whether the file has already been opened. However, this approach does not ensure true thread safety because it relies on shared state without proper synchronization mechanisms.

[C] The solution uses `asyncio.Lock()` instead of `threading.Lock()`, making it suitable for asynchronous operations. While this is a step in the right direction, it still lacks proper synchronization across threads and processes, thus not ensuring true thread safety.

[D] The implementation does not require any changes because the original code already ensures thread safety by checking if the file is open before attempting to close it.

What will be the output of the above code when run? Explain why.

A) 0, 0
B) 1, 1
C) 2, 1
D) 1, 2";"Answer: C) 2, 1

Explanation:
The `call_count` decorator is designed to count how many times a method is called. However, the issue lies in how decorators are applied and shared across class methods. In Python, when you apply a decorator to multiple methods of a class using direct assignment like `FunctionCounter.method1 = call_count(FunctionCounter.method1)`, the decorator's state (in this case, `call_count`) is not preserved or shared between these methods.

In the provided code:
- The first two method calls (`fc.method1()` twice) correctly increment the `call_count` for `method1`.
- The third method call (`fc.method2()`) does not affect `method1`'s count because it was already assigned a different state with its own separate `call_count`.

Thus, `FunctionCounter.method1.call_count` remains 2 (since it was only incremented twice), and `FunctionCounter.method2.call_count` is still 0 (as it was never called)."

**Question:** Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a class decorator which measures and prints the execution time of any method in the decorated class. The goal is to enhance each method's functionality without modifying its implementation.

```python
import time

def measure_time(cls):
    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(value):
            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))
    return cls

def _time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f""Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@measure_time
class ExampleClass:
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(1)
```

**Question:** What is the issue with this implementation of the `measure_time` decorator, and how might you fix it to ensure that the original method behavior remains intact?

A) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.

B) The decorator modifies the class in-place which could cause issues if multiple instances are created.

C) The `wrapper` function is not capturing the correct reference of the original method.

D) The `measure_time` decorator should be a metaclass instead of a class decorator to avoid modifying the class directly.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer:** A) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.

**Explanation:** The current implementation assumes that all attributes in the class dictionary are callable methods, but it fails to distinguish between static methods and instance methods. When a method is called on an instance, Python first checks if it exists in the instance's `__dict__`, then in its class. Since the decorator replaces all callables with wrappers, it mistakenly tries to wrap static methods as well, leading to errors.

To fix this, you need to ensure that only instance methods are wrapped. Here is a corrected version of the `measure_time` decorator:

```python
import time

def measure_time(cls):
    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(value) and not isinstance(value, staticmethod):
            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))
    return cls

def _time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f""Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@measure_time
class ExampleClass:
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    @staticmethod
    def method2():
        time.sleep(1)
```

In this corrected version, the decorator checks if the callable is not a staticmethod using `isinstance(value, staticmethod)` before wrapping it, ensuring that only instance methods are modified."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

        print(""Connecting to the database..."")

# Usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1 is db2)  # What will this print?
```

What does the code above print when `db1` and `db2` are compared using the `is` operator?

A) False  
B) True  
C) An error  
D) The message ""Connecting to the database..."" twice";"B) True

Explanation: In the provided code, both `db1` and `db2` will refer to the same instance of the `DatabaseConnection` class because of the singleton pattern implemented through both a metaclass (`Singleton`) and a decorator (`singleton`). The `metaclass=Singleton` ensures that only one instance of any class decorated with this metaclass can be created. Thus, when `db1 = DatabaseConnection()` and `db2 = DatabaseConnection()`, `db1 is db2` evaluates to True because they both reference the same object."

Which statement is true regarding the above code?

A) The `Timer` class is a metaclass and does not support context management.

B) The `timed_function` decorator measures the execution time of any function it decorates.

C) Using `@timed_function`, the execution time of `compute_sum(1000000)` will be printed before its result.

D) The `Timer` class uses a descriptor for its context management functionality.";"[ANSWER]
B) The `timed_function` decorator measures the execution time of any function it decorates.

Explanation:
- The `Timer` class is not a metaclass but a simple context manager that prints the time taken by the block of code inside its `with` statement.
- The `timed_function` decorator correctly wraps any function to measure and print its execution time. It uses Python's built-in timing functions from the `time` module to calculate the duration and prints it after the decorated function completes.
- The `Timer` class indeed supports context management using the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, which are used in the example with the `with Timer('compute_sum'):` statement.
- Descriptors are not involved in the implementation of context management or decorators as shown in this code."

"2025-05-20 16:01";"";"**Part 1: Question**

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class with a custom attribute:

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['custom_attr'] = 'Hello, World!'

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Instantiate the class and access the custom attribute
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.custom_attr)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) `MyClass` will not have a `custom_attr` attribute because metaclasses are used for defining classes, not instances.

B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will inherit from the metaclass and automatically get the `custom_attr` attribute with the value 'Hello, World!'.

C) The `Meta` metaclass can only be used to add attributes to a class if it is specified when the class is defined.

D) Accessing `obj.custom_attr` will raise an AttributeError because `MyClass` does not define any attributes.

**Part 2: Answer**

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- Option A is incorrect. The metaclass `Meta` successfully adds a custom attribute `custom_attr` to the class `MyClass`. When you instantiate `MyClass`, this attribute is available.
- Option B is correct. The `__new__` method of the metaclass `Meta` is called when `MyClass` is defined, not when an instance of it is created. It adds a new attribute `custom_attr` to the class dictionary before the class is finalized.
- Option C is incorrect. A metaclass can be used to add attributes to any class that uses it, regardless of how often or where it is specified.
- Option D is incorrect. Since `custom_attr` is added by the metaclass, it will be accessible on instances of `MyClass`."
"2025-05-21 00:01";"[QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern. A singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

```python

        if cls not in cls._instances:

What will be the output of the `use_database` function when it is called?

A) Both `db1` and `db2` are new instances, so their identities are different.
B) Both `db1` and `db2` refer to the same instance, so their identities are the same.
C) An error will be raised because metaclasses cannot be used with singletons.
D) The output is unpredictable due to issues with garbage collection.";"B) Both `db1` and `db2` refer to the same instance, so their identities are the same.

Explanation:
The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of the `Database` class is created. When `use_database` is called, it attempts to create two instances (`db1` and `db2`). However, because of the singleton pattern enforced by the metaclass, both variables end up referencing the same instance, as stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`, indicating that they are indeed the same object."

**Question:** Consider the following Python code that aims to create a simple rate limiter decorator. The goal is to ensure that a function can only be called once every `interval` seconds. However, the implementation has an issue.

```python

        last_call_time = 0

    print(""Function is called"")

# Example usage:
my_function()  # Calls the function normally
time.sleep(0.5)
my_function()  # Should wait for 0.5 seconds before calling again
```

Which of the following statements correctly identifies a problem with this implementation?

A) The `rate_limit` decorator does not properly handle the case when multiple instances of `my_function` are called concurrently.

B) The use of a nonlocal variable inside the wrapper function can lead to memory leaks under certain conditions.

C) The sleep time calculation in the wrapper is incorrect, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.

D) The `last_call_time` variable is not thread-safe, which could result in unexpected behavior when called from multiple threads.";"**Answer:** A

**Explanation:** The issue with the provided implementation is that it does not handle concurrent calls correctly. When multiple instances of `my_function` are called concurrently, each call will check the global `last_call_time`, which can lead to all instances waiting for their turn instead of only one instance at a time. This defeats the purpose of rate limiting. The decorator should maintain separate state for each instance or thread if concurrent access is expected."

D) Error: Cannot run inside async context";"A) Task started  
   Task completed  
   None  

Explanation:
- The `AsyncDecorator` is a class that takes an asynchronous function (`async_task`) as its argument.
- When the decorated function is called, it uses `asyncio.run()` to execute the asynchronous function in a new event loop. This is necessary because `asyncio.run()` is used for running top-level entry point coroutines and should be called only once per program.
- Inside `async_task`, an asyncio sleep of 1 second is simulated using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`.
- When `async_task` completes, the function prints ""Task completed"".
- Since the result of `async_task` is not explicitly returned or captured, it defaults to `None`. Therefore, the final printed output is `Task started`, `Task completed`, and `None`.

Imagine you're developing a web framework in Python, and you want to ensure that all routes defined are secure. You decide to implement a decorator `@secure` that logs the user ID and route accessed before executing the view function. However, you also want this decorator to be reusable across different classes without manually applying it to each method.

Here's a simplified version of what you have:

```python
from functools import wraps

def secure(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        user_id = kwargs.get('user_id')
        route = func.__name__
        print(f""Accessing {route} by user {user_id}"")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class SecureView:

        return ""Welcome to the homepage""

    @secure
    def profile(self, user_id=None):
        return ""This is your profile""
```

Now, you want to create a metaclass that automatically applies this `@secure` decorator to all methods of any class it decorates. This way, you can simply define your view classes without worrying about applying the decorator manually.

Here's your task:
1. Implement a metaclass `SecureMeta` that applies the `@secure` decorator to all non-static methods of any class.
2. Create a class `SecureApp` using this metaclass and define some methods like `home`, `dashboard`, etc.

Write the code for `SecureMeta` and an example usage of `SecureApp`.";"[ANSWER]

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` correctly logs all attribute accesses on instances of `MyClass`.
B) The method `log_access` is added to `MyClass` via the metaclass.
C) The original `__getattribute__` method is preserved and called when accessing attributes.
D) The class `MyClass` cannot be instantiated because of a missing constructor.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The original `__getattribute__` method is preserved and called when accessing attributes.

Explanation:
The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` correctly modifies the `__getattribute__` method of any class it decorates. It wraps the original `__getattribute__` with a new function that logs access to attributes before delegating to the original method. This ensures that all attribute accesses are logged, and the original behavior is preserved.

Option A is incorrect because no logging occurs on attribute access directly; only method calls log access.
Option B is incorrect because no `log_access` method is added; instead, `__getattribute__` is modified.
Option D is incorrect because there is no issue with instantiating `MyClass`; it can be instantiated normally."

C) The `writer.write` method blocks until the data is fully sent to the client.

D) The `main` function runs in a separate thread.

### Part 2 (Answer)

**";"** C

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The `handle_request` function is defined as an asynchronous function with the `async def` syntax, which means it will run asynchronously.
  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The `asyncio.start_server` function creates an asynchronous server. It allows handling multiple client connections concurrently without blocking.

- **Option C**: Correct. The `writer.write` method does not block; it schedules data to be sent and returns immediately. The actual sending happens later, which is why we need to call `await writer.drain()` to ensure the data has been fully sent before closing the connection.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. The `main` function runs in the main thread of the asyncio event loop. If you want it to run in a separate thread, you would typically use `threading` or `concurrent.futures`, but that's not related to how this server is set up.

This question tests understanding of how asyncio works for creating non-blocking servers and how methods like `write` and `drain` function in asynchronous programming."

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `AsyncDecorator` class does not use any asyncio features.

B) When calling `fetch_data`, it will block the event loop until the data is fetched.

C) The `fetch_data` function is automatically converted into a coroutine when decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`.

D) The decorator correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions seamlessly.";"D) The decorator correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions seamlessly.

Explanation: 
The `AsyncDecorator` class defines an `__init__` method that stores the original function, and a `__call__` method that uses `asyncio.run()` to execute the decorated function within the asyncio event loop. Since `fetch_data` is defined as an `async def`, it does not need to be made synchronous; it can be directly run using `asyncio.run()`. Therefore, the decorator correctly handles asynchronous functions without interfering with their async nature."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to automatically log any method call on an instance of a class. The goal is to understand how this works in detail.

Which of the following statements correctly describes how to use and understand the metaclass `LogMeta` in this code?

A) The `MyClass` automatically logs all its methods when called.  
B) The `log_method_call` static method is applied to each instance method of classes that inherit from `MyClass`.  
C) The `LogMeta` only works for class attributes and not for instance methods.  
D) Any class inheriting from `MyClass` can call methods without logging because the metaclass does not affect them.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `MyClass` automatically logs all its methods when called.
This statement is incorrect. The metaclass `LogMeta` intercepts and modifies the class definition, adding a log decorator to each callable attribute (methods). However, this change affects the class itself, not individual instances.

B) The `log_method_call` static method is applied to each instance method of classes that inherit from `MyClass`.
This statement is correct. When a class inherits from `MyClass`, its methods are wrapped by the `log_method_call` decorator during the metaclass's `__new__` method execution. This means every time an instance method of any subclass is called, it will print a log message.

C) The `LogMeta` only works for class attributes and not for instance methods.
This statement is incorrect. As shown in the code, the metaclass applies to all callable attributes, including instance methods, when defining classes that use it as their metaclass.

D) Any class inheriting from `MyClass` can call methods without logging because the metaclass does not affect them.
This statement is incorrect. Due to the modification applied by the metaclass during the definition of subclasses, calling any method on an instance of a subclass will automatically include log output."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure all instances of a class have a unique identifier:

Explanation: The `UniqueIDMeta` metaclass uses a class-level variable `_instance_id` to keep track of the number of instances created. When an instance is created, it assigns the current value of `_instance_id` as its id and then increments `_instance_id`. Therefore, when `a = MyClass()` is executed, `a.id` is set to 0, and when `b = MyClass()` is executed, `b.id` is set to 1."

This code defines a context manager `Timer` that measures and prints the execution time of any block of code it wraps. When `timed_function()` is called, it runs a loop for 1 million iterations inside the `with` statement.

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `__exit__` method will never be called if an exception occurs within the `with` block.
B) The `Timer` class can be used as both a decorator and a context manager.
C) The `Timer` class cannot be subclassed to add new functionality.
D) The `Timer` class uses Python's garbage collector to manage its resources.";"B) The `Timer` class can be used as both a decorator and a context manager.

Explanation:
The provided code snippet demonstrates the use of a context manager. However, it does not provide any indication that this class could also be used as a decorator. Decorators are typically implemented using functions or classes that wrap another function or method, while context managers are used with `with` statements to manage resources like file handles or timers.

For a class to be usable both as a context manager and a decorator, it would need separate methods for these purposes, which is not the case here. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.

Statement A is also incorrect because if an exception occurs within the `with` block, the `__exit__` method will still be called to handle any cleanup or error handling as specified in the context manager protocol.

Option C is incorrect because a class can always be subclassed to add new functionality. The `Timer` class could be extended with additional methods or attributes without breaking its basic functionality.

Statement D is also incorrect as the `Timer` class does not rely on Python's garbage collector for managing its resources. Instead, it manages resources explicitly by using methods like `__enter__` and `__exit__`, which are part of the context management protocol."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `MyClass` will not be instantiated because `LogMeta` prevents instantiation.
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will log ""Instantiating MyClass"".
C) There will be a runtime error because `LogMeta` does not properly define the `__call__` method.
D) The `LogMeta` class must explicitly call `super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)` to allow instantiation.";"B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will log ""Instantiating MyClass"".

Explanation:
The `LogMeta` metaclass correctly overrides the `__new__` method to print a message whenever a class is instantiated. The metaclass's job is to customize class creation, and in this case, it logs a message before calling the superclass's `__new__` method to actually create the class. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `LogMeta` metaclass will be invoked, resulting in the log message ""Instantiating MyClass"" being printed."

B) It will print ""Before calling"", wait for 1 second, then print ""After calling"" and finally output ""Result: 9"".

C) It will execute the function synchronously without any additional prints.

D) The program will hang indefinitely because it is waiting for an infinite loop inside `my_async_function`.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A) C

Explanation:
- The code defines a class decorator `AsyncDecorator` that wraps around an asynchronous function.
- When `my_async_function` is decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`, the decorator's `__call__` method is invoked when the function is called, not when it’s defined.
- Inside `AsyncDecorator.__call__`, ""Before calling"" is printed, then the decorated function (`self.func`) is awaited. During this await, control yields back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run.
- After the awaited task completes (in this case, after 1 second), ""After calling"" is printed, and the result of `my_async_function` is returned.
- When `main()` runs, it calls `await my_async_function(3)`, which results in ""Before calling"", a 1-second delay, then ""After calling"", followed by ""Result: 9"".
- Option A is incorrect because the decorator does handle async functions correctly. Options B and D are incorrect as there's no infinite loop or hanging behavior."

Explanation: In the given code, `await asyncio.sleep(1)` is used to simulate an I/O operation that would block if it were run synchronously. However, because the tasks are awaited using `asyncio.gather`, Python's event loop allows other tasks to run while waiting for the sleep to complete.

B) The `LogMeta` metaclass applies the `log_decorator` to all callable attributes of `MyClass`, effectively wrapping them with a print statement before and after their execution.

C) Using `ContextDecorator` in `LogDecorator` ensures that the `with` statement can be used to manage context, but it will not affect the behavior when called as a regular decorator.

D) The use of both metaclass and decorators on the same methods results in double wrapping due to overlapping effects.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**B**

The `LogMeta` metaclass applies the `log_decorator` to all callable attributes of `MyClass`. This means that both `method1` and `method2` are wrapped with the `log_decorator`, resulting in two ""Before calling function"" and ""After calling function"" outputs when they are called. The `ContextDecorator` class is used in `LogDecorator` to ensure it can be used as a context manager, but this does not affect how it behaves when applied as a decorator.

The other statements are incorrect because:
- A) While both methods are wrapped with the `log_decorator`, each method is only wrapped once.
- C) The use of `ContextDecorator` allows the decorator to function as a context manager, but this does not prevent it from also being used as a regular decorator.
- D) The metaclass and decorators do not result in double wrapping. Each method is decorated only once by both the metaclass and the explicit decorator application."

- The metaclass `Meta` modifies any class it decorates by adding a method `add` that takes an argument and returns the argument incremented by 5.
- When `MyClass` is defined with `metaclass=Meta`, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called to create the class, and the `add` method is added to the class dictionary.
- An instance of `MyClass` is created and the `add` method is called on this instance with the argument 10.

C) The code will raise a `RuntimeError` because the logger is not properly managed.  
D) The output will be ""INFO: Starting"", ""INFO: Processing"", and it will hang waiting for the final ""Ending"".";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Answer:** B) The output will be ""INFO: Starting"", ""INFO: Processing"", ""INFO: Ending"" in that specific order.

**Explanation:**

The given code uses `asyncio.gather` to concurrently run multiple tasks, each of which logs a message. Since all tasks are awaited within the `main` function, they will execute in sequence because `asyncio.gather` schedules them to run as soon as possible but does not guarantee their order if there is any overlap.

To ensure that `logger` is not garbage collected before all logging tasks complete, we need to keep a reference to it. In Python, an object is considered garbage collectible only when there are no more references pointing to it. By keeping the `logger` variable in scope until after all tasks have completed, it ensures that it remains alive long enough for the garbage collector to determine if it can be freed.

For example:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncLogger:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    async def log(self, message):
        print(f""{self.name}: {message}"")

async def main():
    logger = AsyncLogger(""INFO"")
    await asyncio.gather(
        logger.log(""Starting""),
        logger.log(""Processing""),
        logger.log(""Ending"")
    )
    del logger  # Explicitly deleting the reference to allow garbage collection

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this modified version, the `logger` variable is explicitly deleted after all tasks have completed. This ensures that `logger` can be garbage collected if no other references to it exist. However, in practical scenarios, you generally don’t need to explicitly delete variables as Python’s garbage collector handles most cases automatically."

**Explanation:** The `CoroutineDecorator` class is designed to be a decorator for asynchronous functions. When `my_decorated_coroutine` is called, it first runs the undecorated `my_coroutine`, and then proceeds with its own logic. Since `asyncio.run()` is used inside the decorator to execute the decorated coroutine, both the original and decorated coroutine methods are executed within the same event loop run by `asyncio.run()`. This results in the outputs being interleaved as shown in option A."

Consider the following Python code that aims to create a context manager for measuring the execution time of a block of code:

```python

        self.start = time.time()

However, when trying to use this context manager with an asynchronous function, it fails. Your task is to modify the `Timer` class so that it can be used both synchronously and asynchronously.

A) Modify the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to use asyncio's event loop if it exists.
B) Create a separate `AsyncTimer` class that inherits from `Timer` but overrides the context management protocol for async contexts.
C) Use a decorator to convert the `Timer` class into an asynchronous context manager.
D) Implement a new method called `async_enter` and `async_exit` and use them instead of `__enter__` and `__exit__`.";"B) Create a separate `AsyncTimer` class that inherits from `Timer` but overrides the context management protocol for async contexts.

Explanation:
The correct answer is option B. To make the existing `Timer` class work with asynchronous functions, we need to create an `AsyncTimer` class that overrides the context management protocol specifically for use in asynchronous code. This involves implementing methods like `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` instead of the standard `__enter__` and `__exit__`. The existing `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods should be preserved for synchronous use, as they will still work with non-async contexts. By creating a subclass specifically for async usage, we maintain compatibility with both synchronous and asynchronous code without modifying the original class's behavior."

C) Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method  
D) An error will occur because `my_decorator` cannot be applied to methods in Python 3

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is C) Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method.

Explanation: In Python 3, decorators can indeed be applied to instance methods within a class using metaclasses or by directly applying decorators at method definition. Here's how it works:

- When you apply `@my_decorator` above the method `my_method`, it wraps the method with another function that adds some pre and post-execution behavior.
- The `__metaclass__ = type` in the class declaration is necessary because, starting from Python 3, classes are first-class objects and need a metaclass to be properly instantiated. If you omit this line, Python will raise an error because it cannot instantiate a class without a valid metaclass.

Therefore, when you create an instance `obj` of `MyClass` and call `obj.my_method()`, the output will be as follows:
1. The pre-function call message is printed.
2. The method's code runs, printing ""Hello from my_method"".
3. The post-function call message is printed.

This demonstrates that decorators can indeed modify class methods in Python 3, even when using metaclasses for class instantiation."

C) Task started

D) Task started  
   Task finished after 3 seconds  
   Main function completed

**Part 2: Answer**

A) Task started  
   Task finished  
   Main function completed

**Explanation:** 

The `AsyncTimer` class is a decorator that delays the execution of any coroutine it decorates by the specified delay. In this case, `@AsyncTimer(2)` means that any coroutine passed to it will have its execution delayed by 2 seconds before proceeding.

When you call `await slow_task()` in the `main` function, `slow_task` is decorated with `AsyncTimer(2)`. This means that when `slow_task` is called, it first waits for 2 seconds (due to the decorator), and then proceeds with its original execution. The output will therefore be:

1. ""Task started"" (immediately)
2. Task finishes after an additional 2 seconds (""Task finished"")
3. Then, after another second (total of 3 seconds), ""Main function completed""

So, option A is the correct answer as it matches the described behavior."

D) Each thread prints its own key-value pair and finally, 'Final config' will be `{'key_0': 'value_4'}`";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Each thread prints its own key-value pair and finally, 'Final config' will be `{'key_0': 'value_0'}`  

Explanation:
- The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of the `ConfigManager` class is created.
- However, since there is no synchronization mechanism in place (e.g., locks), multiple threads can modify the `configs` dictionary simultaneously, leading to race conditions.
- When a thread writes to `self.configs[key]`, it may not see the most up-to-date value written by another thread due to these race conditions. This explains why the output of each thread printing its own key-value pair but the final config having only one entry (`{'key_0': 'value_4'}`) is possible.
- The actual final config will depend on the timing and order in which threads complete their operations, so `{'key_0': 'value_0'}` is a plausible output among others."

Explanation:

The provided code defines an async decorator `async_decorator` that wraps around another asynchronous function `my_async_function`.

When `main()` is executed, it creates a list of tasks for `my_async_function`, which are then gathered and awaited concurrently. 

The output shows each ""Before calling function"" print statement five times, followed by ""After calling function"" five times. This indicates that the decorator was called correctly five times, once for each task created in the `main()` function. The actual results of the asynchronous tasks (0*2=0, 1*2=2, 2*2=4, 3*2=6, 4*2=8) are not printed because the decorator is only responsible for printing messages before and after the function call.

The correct answer demonstrates an understanding of how decorators work with asynchronous functions in Python, specifically how they can be used to add behavior (in this case, logging) around the execution of other functions."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a simple caching mechanism using decorators. The goal is to cache the results of function calls based on their arguments.

```python

Which of the following is a correct statement regarding the `fibonacci` function when using the `cache_results` decorator?

A) The first call to `fibonacci(5)` will compute all previous Fibonacci numbers up to 3.

B) Subsequent calls to `fibonacci(n)` where `n <= 1` will not be cached.

C) The cache will store results for all arguments passed to `fibonacci`.

D) The cache will only store results for unique sequences of recursive calls that lead to different outcomes.";"[ANSWER] D) The cache will only store results for unique sequences of recursive calls that lead to different outcomes.

**Explanation**: The `cache_results` decorator is designed to cache the results of function calls based on their arguments. In this case, it caches the results of the Fibonacci sequence calculations. When a call to `fibonacci(n)` is made, the decorator first checks if the result for those arguments is already in the cache. If not, it computes the result using the function (in this case, the Fibonacci calculation), stores it in the cache, and then returns the result. For recursive functions like `fibonacci`, different sequences of calls to reach the same base case will produce different results, leading to unique keys in the cache. Therefore, only those unique sequences of recursive calls will be cached."

C) The timer will start but not perform any action.
D) The program will hang indefinitely without printing anything.";"Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is A) The program will print ""Timer tick"" every second.

Explanation: In the provided code, `AsyncTimer` starts an asynchronous task that runs `run()` method using `asyncio.create_task()`. Inside the `run()` method, there's a loop that sleeps for the specified interval (1 second in this case) and then calls the callback function (`on_timer`).

B) Data from http://example.com/0, Data from http://example.com/1, Data from http://example.com/2, Data from http://example.com/3, Data from http://example.com/4

Explanation: The `asyncio.gather` function runs all the coroutines concurrently and waits for all of them to complete. Each coroutine fetches data from a URL in an asynchronous manner. When all coroutines finish, their results are gathered and printed.

Option A is incorrect because it only prints the ""Fetching"" messages before the sleep completes.

D) None of the above.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B: The string ""Hello from metaclass!"" is printed when an instance of `MyClass` is created and the attribute is accessed.

Explanation:
- When a class like `MyClass` is decorated with `Meta`, Python's class creation process invokes the metaclass's `__new__` method.
- In this case, the metaclass `Meta` modifies the dictionary `dct` that defines the class by adding an entry `'added_attribute': 'Hello from metaclass!'`.
- The `super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)` call in `Meta.__new__()` creates a new class with these modifications.
- Therefore, when an instance of `MyClass` is created and the attribute `added_attribute` is accessed on that instance, it correctly returns the string 'Hello from metaclass!'."

A) It enforces that all classes decorated with `class_decorator` must have a class variable named 'decorated'.
B) It ensures that `MyClass` has an attribute called 'decorated' set to True.
C) It raises an error if any class is defined without being decorated, regardless of the decorator used.
D) It checks that all classes using it as their metaclass have a method named 'decorated'.

### Part 2 (Answer)

A) It enforces that all classes decorated with `class_decorator` must have a class variable named 'decorated'.
Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks if the `decorated` attribute is present in the class dictionary during class creation. If it's not found, it raises a `TypeError`. Only `MyClass`, which is decorated with `@class_decorator`, has this attribute set.

B) It ensures that `MyClass` has an attribute called 'decorated' set to True.
Explanation: This is incorrect because the metaclass itself checks for the presence of the `decorated` attribute, not the class decorator. The actual setting happens in the `class_decorator`.

C) It raises an error if any class is defined without being decorated, regardless of the decorator used.
Explanation: This is also incorrect. The metaclass only enforces this rule if it is explicitly used with a decorator that sets the `decorated` attribute.

D) It checks that all classes using it as their metaclass have a method named 'decorated'.

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `add_method` method will not be added to any class that does not use `AddMethodMeta`.
B) When creating an instance of `MyClass`, it immediately calls `new_method` and prints ""Hello from new_method"".
C) Calling `obj.new_method()` will raise an AttributeError.
D) The metaclass is used to dynamically add a method to all classes in the application.";"D) The metaclass is used to dynamically add a method to all classes in the application.

Explanation: In Python, a metaclass is a class that creates and controls other classes. When you define a class with `metaclass=AddMethodMeta`, every instance of that class will have a new method called `new_method`. This is true regardless of whether other classes use the same metaclass or not. The `MyClass` defined in this example is an exception to this rule, as it does not explicitly declare `new_method`, but instances of any class using `AddMethodMeta` will have access to it. Option A is incorrect because only classes explicitly decorated with `AddMethodMeta` will get the new method. Options B and C are incorrect because calling `obj.new_method()` on an instance of a class that does not use `AddMethodMeta` would raise an AttributeError, but since `MyClass` is an exception to this rule, it would not be the case here."

Explanation:
The provided code attempts to make all callable attributes thread-safe using a metaclass. However, in Python, class methods (like `increment`, `decrement`, and `get_value`) do not automatically inherit the `self` parameter, which is necessary for instance-level operations. Therefore, when `add_lock` decorates these methods, they lose their instance context, leading to incorrect behavior or runtime errors.

The `AsyncWebServer` class is intended to start a web server that echoes back any received data. However, when you run the script and try to connect to it using a simple client like `telnet`, you encounter an issue where no response is received from the server.

Identify the problem in this code and suggest how to fix it so that the server correctly handles incoming connections and sends responses as expected.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**A) The problem is with the `handle_client` method not properly handling client disconnections.**
**B) The issue lies in the `start` method not properly closing the server when stopping.**

**Explanation:** The problem lies in the `handle_client` method. While it sends a response back to the client when data is received, it does not handle the case where the client disconnects unexpectedly (e.g., by closing their connection). This can cause the server to get stuck waiting for more data from the disconnected client, which prevents it from processing other incoming connections. To fix this issue, you could add a check to see if there's any data available before attempting to read from the reader, or use an exception handler within the `handle_client` method to gracefully handle client disconnections."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

class ThreadSafeCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    @property
    def value(self):
        with self.lock:
            return self._value

    @value.setter
    def value(self, new_value):
        with self.lock:
            self._value = new_value

    def increment(self):
        with self.lock:
            self.value += 1

def worker(counter):
    for _ in range(1000):

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    counter = ThreadSafeCounter()
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(counter,)) for _ in range(10)]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    print(counter.value)
```

This code attempts to create a thread-safe counter using a `ThreadSafeCounter` class with a private attribute `_value` and a lock. The `increment` method is intended to safely increment the value by 1000 across multiple threads.

Which of the following statements is true regarding the above code?

A) The counter will always print 10000 because it uses threading.Lock to ensure thread safety.
B) The counter may print a number less than 10000 due to race conditions in the `increment` method.
C) The counter will always print 10000, but using decorators would make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
D) The counter may print a number greater than 10000 because of potential deadlocks.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The code uses threading to create multiple threads that increment the shared `counter` object. Each thread performs 1000 increments on the counter. The critical section in the `increment` method is protected by a lock, which means that at any given time, only one thread can execute the code within this section.

However, there are race conditions present in the code. Even though each increment operation is atomic (i.e., it cannot be interrupted), multiple threads can still see and modify `_value` concurrently before their changes are fully written back to memory. This can lead to situations where two or more threads read the same value for `_value`, both increment it, and then write back their incremented values, resulting in a net increase of less than 1000 increments.

Therefore, while the lock ensures that individual increment operations are thread-safe, the overall operation is still subject to race conditions when multiple threads attempt to modify the shared counter concurrently. This means that the final value printed by the program may be less than 10000, making option B correct."

A) ""Task completed"" will be printed after 5 seconds.  
B) The program will hang indefinitely as it is waiting for tasks to complete before exiting.

D) ""Coroutine done"" will be printed after 5 seconds and ""Task completed"" will be printed after every interval of 2 seconds until the coroutine completes.";"A) ""Task completed"" will be printed after 5 seconds.  

**Explanation:** The `run` method of `AsyncTimer` continuously checks for tasks that are not done, and if such a task is found, it waits for the interval time (2 seconds in this case) before printing ""Task completed"". Since the coroutine registered with `register` completes after 5 seconds, when `run` wakes up for the first time, it will print ""Task completed"" at that point. After that, since the coroutine has already finished, no further ""Task completed"" messages will be printed even though the loop continues to run."

Imagine you are developing a library that needs to ensure that all its classes implement certain methods. You want to create a metaclass that checks if these methods exist during class creation and raises an error if they are missing.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
class MethodCheckerMeta(type):
    required_methods = ['method1', 'method2']

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for method in cls.required_methods:

                raise TypeError(f""Class {name} must implement the '{method}' method."")

        pass

# This will work fine
obj = MyClass()

# Uncommenting the following line will raise an error
# class MyMissingMethodsClass(metaclass=MethodCheckerMeta):
#     pass
```

Which of the following is a potential issue with this implementation?

A) The metaclass does not allow for any additional methods to be added to subclasses after creation.

B) The metaclass raises an error when trying to subclass a class that already implements all required methods.

C) The metaclass will correctly raise an error if a method is missing in any subclass.

D) The metaclass can dynamically add the missing methods to classes during their creation.";"C) The metaclass will correctly raise an error if a method is missing in any subclass.

The implementation of `MethodCheckerMeta` checks for the presence of required methods during class creation using `__new__`. If all methods are present, the class is created successfully. However, this implementation does not prevent subclasses from being created without implementing these methods, so option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that existing classes cannot be subclassed, which is not a concern of this metaclass. Option D is incorrect as well since methods are not dynamically added to classes; they must be defined at the time of class creation or inheritance. The correct answer is C, as the metaclass raises an error if any required method is missing in any subclass during their creation."

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify a class dynamically:

        dct['new_attr'] = 'New Attribute'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

Which of the following statements is true about the metaclass `Meta` and its effect on `MyClass`?

A) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to instances of `MyClass`.
B) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to the class itself.
C) Instances of `MyClass` do not have access to `new_attr`.
D) The metaclass has no effect on `MyClass`.";"B) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to the class itself.

Explanation: In Python, when you define a metaclass, it controls how classes are created. By modifying the dictionary (`dct`) passed to the `__new__` method, the metaclass can dynamically add or modify attributes at the class level. In this case, `Meta` adds `new_attr` directly to the `MyClass` dictionary, making it a class attribute rather than an instance attribute. Therefore, instances of `MyClass` do not have access to `new_attr`."

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a class with custom behavior:

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.__value = value

obj = MyClass(10)
```

What is the output of `print(obj.value)`?

A) 10  
B) AttributeError  
C) TypeError  
D) None  

### Part 2: Answer

B) AttributeError

Explanation:
The code attempts to create a custom metaclass (`Meta`) that transforms class attributes into properties. The metaclass dynamically renames each attribute by prefixing it with an underscore and creating a property that accesses this new private attribute.

In the `MyClass`, an attribute named `__value` is defined, but due to the metaclass's behavior, there will be no direct access to this attribute from outside the class. Instead, a property named `value` should be created by the metaclass. However, in the provided code, there is no method to handle this transformation correctly.

When you attempt to access `obj.value`, Python looks for an attribute or property with that name on `MyClass`. Since no such property exists due to the incorrect implementation of the metaclass, it raises an `AttributeError`.

The correct behavior would require adding a method in the metaclass to dynamically create and assign properties for each original attribute.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

What is the output of this script? Explain how the use of metaclasses, decorators, and context managers contributes to thread safety in this example.

A) 0  
B) 1  
C) 2  
D) Error";"B) 1  

The output of this script will be `1`. The use of metaclasses (`SingletonMeta`) ensures that the `ThreadSafeSingleton` class is a singleton, meaning only one instance of it can exist. The decorator pattern is not directly used in this example but could be applied to add additional functionality if needed.

Context managers (`DataAdder`) are crucial for managing resources like locks to ensure thread safety when accessing shared data. In this case, the lock prevents multiple threads from entering the `with` block at the same time, ensuring that the data modification is thread-safe.

The `ThreadSafeSingleton` class itself uses a dictionary (`data`) to store data, and the `add_data_to_singleton` function demonstrates how to use the singleton instance within a context manager. The lock ensures that when the 'temp' key is added, it does not interfere with any other thread attempting to access or modify the same key concurrently.

Therefore, after executing the script, the size of the data dictionary will be `1`, indicating that one item has been successfully added through the context manager while maintaining thread safety."
"2025-06-09 16:03";"";"**Part 1 (Question):**

Imagine you are tasked with creating a system for managing user sessions in an asynchronous web application. You want to ensure that each session has a timeout mechanism, and any session that exceeds this time limit should automatically expire. 

You decide to implement this using Python's `asyncio` library. However, you also want to make sure that the session management logic is easily reusable across different parts of your application without duplicating code.

To achieve this, you consider creating a decorator for sessions that automatically handles the timeout. You then create a metaclass that applies this decorator to any class that represents a session.

Here's an example implementation:

```python
import asyncio

def session_timeout(timeout):
    def decorator(cls):
        async def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            task = loop.create_task(self.__aenter__(*args, **kwargs))
            try:
                result = await asyncio.wait_for(task, timeout=timeout)
                return result
            except asyncio.TimeoutError:
                task.cancel()
                raise Exception(""Session timed out"")
        cls.__aenter__ = wrapper
        return cls
    return decorator

class SessionMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'session_timeout' in dct:
            dct['session_timeout'] = session_timeout(dct['session_timeout'])
        return super().__new__(mcls, name, bases, dct)

class AsyncSession(metaclass=SessionMeta):
    async def __aenter__(self):
        pass

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        pass

# Example usage
class UserSession(AsyncSession):
    session_timeout = 30  # Timeout in seconds

async def main():
    async with UserSession() as session:
        # Simulate work within the session
        await asyncio.sleep(25)
        print(""Session is still active"")

# Run the example
asyncio.run(main())
```

In this implementation, `session_timeout` is a decorator that adds a timeout mechanism to any class decorated with it. The `SessionMeta` metaclass applies this decorator to any class that has a `session_timeout` attribute.

**Question:** What will happen if an instance of `UserSession` is used without waiting for the session to expire, and how does the `AsyncSession` class structure support this functionality?

A) The session will remain active indefinitely.
B) The session will expire after 30 seconds due to the timeout mechanism.
C) An exception will be raised because no timeout was specified.
D) The session will raise an error when trying to access its methods.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The session will expire after 30 seconds due to the timeout mechanism.

Explanation:
The `AsyncSession` class uses a metaclass (`SessionMeta`) that applies a decorator (`session_timeout`) to any class it decorates. In this case, `UserSession` has a `session_timeout` attribute set to 30 seconds. When an instance of `UserSession` is used in an asynchronous context manager (i.e., within the `async with` statement), the `__aenter__` method decorated by `@session_timeout(30)` will be invoked. This method runs the session's entry logic and then waits for it to complete, timing out after 30 seconds if it has not already finished. If the session completes within the timeout period, the result is returned; otherwise, an exception is raised indicating that the session timed out.

The `AsyncSession` class structure supports this functionality by defining abstract methods (`__aenter__` and `__aexit__`) for entering and exiting the session context, respectively. These methods can be overridden in subclasses to provide specific behavior when a session begins or ends. The metaclass ensures that any subclass of `AsyncSession` will have its timeout mechanism applied automatically if it includes a `session_timeout` attribute."

D)

AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute '__init__'
```";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The code uses a metaclass (`Meta`) to automatically decorate all callable attributes of the class it creates with the `log_decorator`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created using the context manager, the `__init__` method is not explicitly defined in the class. Since Python's default behavior for creating instances involves calling `__new__` and then `__init__`, but there's no explicit `__init__`, the metaclass does not add a logging decorator to it.

Therefore, when `obj.method1()` and `obj.method2(3, 4)` are called inside the context manager block:
- The `method1` is decorated with `log_decorator`, so it logs its call before executing.
- The `method2` is also decorated with `log_decorator`, logging its call before executing.

This results in the output:

```
Calling method1 with args: (), kwargs: {}
Executing method1
Calling method2 with args: (3,), kwargs: {'b': 4}
Executing method2 with 3 and 4

B) The tasks will run sequentially, completing in around 12.5 seconds.

D) The code will raise an exception because tasks are not defined correctly.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The tasks will run concurrently, completing in around 0.5 seconds.

Explanation: In this example, `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` is used, which schedules all the tasks to run concurrently. Since each task sleeps for a time equal to its index, the total execution time will be dominated by the longest-running task (the one with the highest index). Therefore, the total execution time will be close to 4 seconds (since task 4 takes the most time)."

You are tasked with creating a caching mechanism that can be applied to any function to store the results of previous computations. This caching mechanism should support both synchronous and asynchronous functions, ensuring efficient use of resources without duplicating computation. Here is a simplified version of how such a caching system might look for synchronous functions:

```python
def cache_results(func):
    cached_results = {}
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if (args, kwargs) not in cached_results:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper

@cache_results
def sync_func(x):
    print(f""Computing {x}"")
    return x * 2

For an asynchronous function, we need to adapt the caching mechanism. Here is a proposed solution:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_cache_results(func):
    cached_results = {}
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if (args, kwargs) not in cached_results:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            cached_results[(args, kwargs)] = result
        return cached_results[(args, kwargs)]
    return wrapper

@async_cache_results
async def async_func(x):
    print(f""Computing {x}"")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an I/O operation
    return x * 3
```

Now, let's test our caching mechanisms:

```python
import time

# Testing synchronous function
start = time.time()
print(sync_func(5))  # Should compute and print 10
time.sleep(1)
print(sync_func(5))  # Should not recompute, just return the cached result
end = time.time()
print(f""Synchronous caching took {end - start} seconds"")

# Testing asynchronous function
async def test_async():
    start = time.time()
    await async_func(5)  # Should compute and print 15
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    await async_func(5)  # Should not recompute, just return the cached result
    end = time.time()
    print(f""Asynchronous caching took {end - start} seconds"")

asyncio.run(test_async())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the functionality and limitations of this caching mechanism?

A. The caching mechanism works for both synchronous and asynchronous functions, and it significantly speeds up computation by avoiding redundant calculations.
B. The caching mechanism does not work with asynchronous functions because asyncio's event loop is needed to handle await expressions, which are not supported outside of an async function.

D. The caching mechanism is flawed because it does not properly invalidate cache entries when inputs change, leading to incorrect results.";"[ANSWER] C. The caching mechanism correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions but may consume more memory due to storing results in a dictionary that grows indefinitely.

After all tasks have completed (due to the `await asyncio.sleep(2)` in each task), the results are gathered and printed. Thus, the messages ""Fetching data..."" appear first, followed by the printed results of the tasks."

C) RuntimeWarning: implicit call to '__init__' in a collection  
D) SyntaxError: invalid syntax";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B) TypeError: Animal must be an abstract class.

Explanation:
In the provided code, the `Meta` metaclass is used to ensure that any subclass of `Animal` must explicitly declare itself as an abstract class by including the key 'abstract' in its dictionary. Since `Animal` does not declare itself as an abstract class and inherits from `ABC`, the metaclass raises a `TypeError` indicating that `Animal` must be an abstract class."

What is the issue with this decorator and how can it be fixed to correctly measure execution time?

A) The `wrapper` function does not store the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, leading to incorrect execution time measurements.

B) The `timer` decorator should use a class instead of a function for better code organization and potential future enhancements.

C) The `wrapper` function does not release any resources it might acquire during execution, which could lead to resource leaks.

D) None of the above. The decorator is correctly implemented to measure execution time.";"A) The `wrapper` function does not store the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, leading to incorrect execution time measurements.

The issue with the current implementation is that while it measures the time taken by the function call and prints it, it does not actually use the returned value. This can lead to confusion if the function's return value is being used elsewhere in the code. To fix this, you should store and return the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)` within the `wrapper` function."

Which of the following statements is true about the provided code?

A) The `fetch_data` function is a synchronous function that fetches data from the given URL.
B) The `main` function uses `asyncio.gather` to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and waits for all of them to complete.
C) The `await asyncio.sleep(1)` in `fetch_data` will block the entire program until 1 second has passed.
D) The code will not execute because it is missing a decorator or context manager.";"B) The `main` function uses `asyncio.gather` to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and waits for all of them to complete.

Explanation: The code correctly demonstrates the use of asynchronous functions with `await` in an `asyncio` event loop. The `fetch_data` function is defined with `async def`, indicating it's an asynchronous function that performs a non-blocking operation using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`. The `main` function creates a list of tasks by calling `fetch_data` with different URLs and then uses `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` to run all these tasks concurrently. Finally, it waits for all tasks to complete before printing their results. This demonstrates effective use of asynchronous programming in Python to handle multiple I/O-bound operations efficiently."

Consider the following Python code that uses metaclasses to add a method to all classes dynamically:

class Derived(Base):
    pass

def test_metaclass():
    obj = Derived()
    assert obj.new_method() == 'This is a new method'
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `new_method` will only be added to the `Derived` class, not `Base`.

B) When `Derived` inherits from `Base`, no methods are added because metaclasses cannot modify existing classes.

C) The `new_method` will be available on all instances of any subclass of `Base`, including `Derived`.

D) The `new_method` is only accessible if the class is instantiated directly with `Meta()`, not through inheritance.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
In Python, metaclasses control how a class is created. When a new class is defined, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called with the class name, its base classes, and a dictionary of attributes. The code in the question demonstrates that the metaclass adds a method to all classes derived from it.

In this case, when `Derived` inherits from `Base`, the `Meta.__new__` method is invoked for both `Base` and `Derived`. This means that `new_method` is added not just to `Derived` but also to any class that inherits from `Base`. Therefore, when an instance of `Derived` or any other subclass of `Base` is created, it will have access to the `new_method`.

This example shows how metaclasses can be used to add functionality across all subclasses dynamically, making them a powerful tool for advanced Python development."

A) 
Function method1 called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}
10

Function method2 called with args: (4,), kwargs: {}

**Explanation:**  
The `log_arguments` decorator logs the arguments and keyword arguments when a function is called. The `MyMeta` metaclass automatically decorates all callable attributes of any class it creates with `log_arguments`. When you create an instance of `MyClass`, both `method1` and `method2` are decorated with `log_arguments`.

B) The execution time of `compute_sum` is measured in milliseconds.

C) The decorator `timer` can be used to measure the execution time of any function, regardless of its complexity.

D) Applying the `timer` decorator increases memory usage due to additional function calls.

### Part 2 (Answer)
**A) The `compute_sum` function will execute faster with the decorator applied.**

**Explanation:** This is incorrect because adding a decorator that measures execution time will introduce some overhead, which can potentially slow down the function's execution if it's already optimized. The decorator adds a small cost by recording and calculating the time before and after the function call.

**B) The execution time of `compute_sum` is measured in milliseconds.**

**Explanation:** This statement is incorrect because the `time.time()` function returns the current time in seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970). While it provides high resolution, it does not directly measure in milliseconds.

**C) The decorator `timer` can be used to measure the execution time of any function, regardless of its complexity.**

**Explanation:** This statement is correct. Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code. The `timer` decorator can be applied to any function to measure how long it takes to execute.

**D) Applying the `timer` decorator increases memory usage due to additional function calls.**

**Explanation:** This statement is partially correct. While applying a decorator does introduce additional function calls, which can affect performance and potentially increase memory usage slightly, the impact is generally minimal for most use cases. More significant changes would be expected in terms of execution time rather than memory usage.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

After function call  

B) Data fetched  
Before function call  
After function call  

C) Error: 'fetch_data' is not an awaitable object  

D) None";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is A) Before function call  
Data fetched  
After function call  

Explanation:

- The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator is applied to the `fetch_data` coroutine.
- When `asyncio.run(main())` is called, it starts the event loop and schedules the execution of `main()`.
- Inside `main()`, `await fetch_data()` is encountered. This triggers the `__call__` method of the `AsyncDecorator` class.
- The decorator prints ""Before function call"" before calling `self.func(*args, **kwargs)`, which is `fetch_data()`.
- The execution of `fetch_data()` is paused, and control returns to the event loop to process other tasks (in this case, there are no other tasks).
- After 1 second, the simulated network request completes, and `fetch_data()` resumes, returning ""Data fetched"".
- The decorator then prints ""After function call"" and returns the result.
- Finally, `main()` receives the result of `fetch_data()`, which is printed as ""Data fetched"".

Therefore, the output will be:

```
Before function call
Data fetched
After function call

C) Using a metaclass in this way can lead to unintended side effects, such as modifying classes defined in other modules.

**Explanation**: The metaclass `AutoResetMeta` automatically adds a `reset` method to any class it decorates. This method sets all non-callable attributes (excluding magic methods like `__init__`) to zero when called. While this might be useful for certain scenarios, it can have unintended side effects if used on classes that are defined in other modules or are part of larger systems where such modifications could cause issues. Additionally, while the implementation does reset all non-method attributes to zero, not just integer ones, option A is close but not entirely accurate because it implies a type check which isn't present."

When `MyClass` is instantiated as `obj = MyClass()`, the `Meta.__new__` method is automatically called because `MyClass` specifies `metaclass=Meta`.

Which of the following is a potential issue with this server implementation that could lead to unexpected behavior or resource leaks?

A) The use of `asyncio.sleep(3600)` in an infinite loop might prevent the event loop from processing other tasks.

B) There's no mechanism for stopping the server gracefully, which could lead to hanging threads if not handled properly.

C) The server does not handle exceptions that may occur within request handlers like `handle_request`.

D) None of the above; the provided code is correct and does not have any issues.";"B) There's no mechanism for stopping the server gracefully, which could lead to hanging threads if not handled properly.

Explanation: The current implementation lacks a way to stop or shut down the server.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print(""Fetching data..."")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate a delay
    return ""Data fetched""

class AsyncLogger:
    async def __aenter__(self):

        return data

# Usage
result = asyncio.run(process_data())
print(f""Processed result: {result}"")
```

Which of the following statements is true about the above code?

A) The `fetch_data` function will run synchronously because it uses `async def`.

B) The `process_data` function will execute the `fetch_data` and `log` methods concurrently.

C) The `AsyncLogger` class implements asynchronous context management using `__aenter__`, `log`, and `__aexit__`.

D) The `result` variable will contain the string ""Processed result: Data fetched"".";"### Part 2 (Answer)
**Correct Answer:** C

**Detailed Explanation:** 
- **Statement A is incorrect**: While `fetch_data` is defined with `async def`, it does not execute asynchronously unless called within an asynchronous context. The coroutine nature of `fetch_data` means it can pause execution at the `await asyncio.sleep(2)` line, but it won't run until scheduled in an event loop.
- **Statement B is incorrect**: Asynchronous operations like calling a coroutine (e.g., `fetch_data()`) will not execute concurrently within a single thread unless explicitly managed using features like `asyncio.create_task` or scheduling them in different tasks. In the given code, `await fetch_data()` and `await logger.log(data)` are sequential, not concurrent.
- **Statement C is correct**: The `AsyncLogger` class correctly implements asynchronous context management by defining the methods `__aenter__`, `log`, and `__aexit__`. This allows the class to manage resources asynchronously when used with `async with`.
- **Statement D is incorrect**: The value of `result` will be the data returned by `fetch_data()`, which is ""Data fetched"". Therefore, `result` will not contain ""Processed result: Data fetched""; it will simply contain ""Data fetched"".

This question tests the understanding of asynchronous programming in Python, specifically the use of coroutines and context managers for resource management."
"2025-06-17 16:02";"[QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a custom logging system that automatically prefixes each log message with the current timestamp. This system should be implemented as a decorator for any function that needs logging capabilities.

1. Create a decorator `log_with_timestamp` that can be applied to any function.
2. The decorator should prepend the current timestamp (formatted as ""YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"") to each log message.
3. Ensure that the original function is still callable after decoration.

Here is an example of how you might use this decorator:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def log_with_timestamp(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Your implementation here
        pass
    return wrapper

@log_with_timestamp
def my_function():
    print(""This is a test log message."")

my_function()
```

Which of the following snippets correctly implements the `log_with_timestamp` decorator?

A) 
```python
from datetime import datetime

def log_with_timestamp(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")
        print(f""{timestamp} - {func.__name__} called with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
```

B) 
```python
from datetime import datetime

def log_with_timestamp(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")
        print(f""{timestamp} - {func.__name__}"")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
```

C) 
```python
from datetime import datetime

def log_with_timestamp(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")
        print(f""{timestamp} - {func.__name__}"")
        return func()
    return wrapper

        print(f""{timestamp} - {func.__name__}"")
    return wrapper
```";"A) Correct. This implementation correctly logs the timestamp and function call details while allowing the original function to execute.

B) Incorrect. The decorator does not capture the arguments passed to the function, which is necessary for a more comprehensive log message.

C) Incorrect. Calling `func()` without passing any arguments will result in an error if the function requires arguments.

D) Incorrect. This implementation only logs the timestamp and function name, but does not pass any arguments or execute the original function."
"2025-06-18 00:01";"";"**Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class attribute counter. The goal is to count how many instances of the class have been created.

```python
class InstanceCounter(type):
    _instance_count = 0

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        cls._instance_count += 1

    @classmethod
    def get_instance_count(cls):
        return cls._instance_count

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceCounter):
    pass
```

Now, if you create multiple instances of `MyClass` and then call the class method `get_instance_count`, which value will it return?

A) 0  
B) The number of times `MyClass` was subclassed  
C) The number of instances of `MyClass` created  
D) None of the above

**Part 2: Answer**

C) The number of instances of `MyClass` created

Explanation:
- The metaclass `InstanceCounter` is defined to count the number of instances created by any class that uses it as a metaclass.
- In the `__call__` method, each time an instance of a class using this metaclass is created, `_instance_count` is incremented by 1.
- The `get_instance_count` class method returns the current value of `_instance_count`, which reflects how many instances of classes using `InstanceCounter` have been created.

Thus, if you create multiple instances of `MyClass`, calling `MyClass.get_instance_count()` will return the correct number of instances created."

D. None of the above";"**Explanation:**

The correct answer is A. The metaclass `MyMeta` overrides the `__call__` method to log the arguments passed when an instance of `MyClass` is created. This demonstrates how you can extend and modify the behavior of class instantiation using a metaclass in Python."
"2025-06-18 16:03";"### Question:
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to implement a simple caching mechanism for asynchronous functions using a metaclass:

```python
import asyncio

class CacheMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        cache = {}
        original_method = dct.get('fetch_data')

        if original_method:
            async def cached_method(*args, **kwargs):
                key = args + tuple(kwargs.items())
                if key not in cache:
                    cache[key] = await original_method(*args, **kwargs)
                return cache[key]
            
            dct['fetch_data'] = cached_method

        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class DataFetcher(metaclass=CacheMeta):
    async def fetch_data(self, url):
        # Simulate an HTTP request
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(""http://example.com""))
    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(""http://example.com""))  # This should be fetched from cache

asyncio.run(main())
```

What issue might arise with this implementation, and how can it be fixed?

A) The `cache` dictionary is not thread-safe and could lead to race conditions.

B) The caching mechanism does not handle asynchronous operations correctly.

C) The original method name is changed without proper handling, leading to potential issues when subclassing.

D) The cache will always be empty due to the incorrect use of `key`.";"### Answer:
A) The `cache` dictionary is not thread-safe and could lead to race conditions.

**Explanation:** In this implementation, the caching mechanism uses a simple dictionary without any synchronization mechanisms. If multiple asynchronous operations are performed concurrently and access the cache simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions where two or more tasks might attempt to write to or read from the same key in the cache at the same time. This could result in incorrect data being returned or other unexpected behavior.

**Correct Fix:** To resolve this issue, you should use a thread-safe caching mechanism such as `threading.Lock` for synchronous code or `asyncio.Lock` for asynchronous code to ensure that only one task can access the cache at a time. Here is an example of how you might modify the caching mechanism using `asyncio.Lock`:

```python
import asyncio

class CacheMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        cache = {}
        lock = asyncio.Lock()
        original_method = dct.get('fetch_data')

        if original_method:
            async def cached_method(*args, **kwargs):
                key = args + tuple(kwargs.items())
                async with lock:
                    if key not in cache:
                        cache[key] = await original_method(*args, **kwargs)
                    return cache[key]
            
            dct['fetch_data'] = cached_method

        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class DataFetcher(metaclass=CacheMeta):
    async def fetch_data(self, url):
        # Simulate an HTTP request
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        return f""Data from {url}""

# Usage
async def main():
    fetcher = DataFetcher()
    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(""http://example.com""))
    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(""http://example.com""))  # This should be fetched from cache

asyncio.run(main())
```

By using `async with lock`, you ensure that only one task can execute the critical section of code (i.e., accessing or updating the cache) at a time, thus preventing race conditions and ensuring that the caching mechanism works correctly under concurrent access."

A) Each class will have its own independent counter, ensuring that `User` instances and `Product` instances will have unique identifiers.

B) The metaclass shares a single `_counter` between all classes using it, meaning both `User` and `Product` instances will share the same set of identifiers.

D) The metaclass implementation is correct but may lead to memory leaks due to improper use of class variables.";"B) The metaclass shares a single `_counter` between all classes using it, meaning both `User` and `Product` instances will share the same set of identifiers.

**Explanation:** In Python, metaclass attributes are shared across all subclasses. Therefore, in the provided code, `_counter` is a class attribute of `UniqueIDMeta`, which means any modification to it through an instance of a subclass (like `User`) will affect the value for all instances of other subclasses (`Product`).

D) An instance of `AsyncClass` can be created without any errors, and when `_run` is called on that instance, it will execute asynchronously.

Explanation: 
- The `AsyncMeta` metaclass dynamically decorates all methods in the subclass with `async_decorator`, but since `_run` already has a method named `_run`, it does not get affected by the decorator.
- When an instance of `AsyncClass` is created, the `_run` coroutine is decorated and can be called asynchronously using `await`.

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a custom decorator to measure the execution time of functions:

Which of the following modifications to the `compute_sum` function would correctly handle the case where the function is called with no arguments?

A) Change the decorator to accept default parameters.

B) Modify the `timer` decorator to ensure it handles functions without arguments gracefully.

C) Add a conditional inside the `wrapper` function to check if `args` and `kwargs` are empty.

D) None of the above. The current implementation is correct and robust.";"B) Modify the `timer` decorator to ensure it handles functions without arguments gracefully.

Explanation: The current implementation of the `timer` decorator assumes that there will always be at least one argument (`func`) passed to it. If a function decorated with `@timer` does not accept any arguments, calling this function will result in a TypeError because the wrapper will not receive any positional or keyword arguments other than those intended for the wrapped function itself.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that our decorator can handle functions without arguments correctly. One way to do this is by modifying the `timer` decorator to check if `args` and `kwargs` are empty within the wrapper function and adjust its behavior accordingly. For example:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n=1000):  # Added default argument to make the function callable without arguments
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i
    return total

This modification ensures that the `compute_sum` function can be called with or without an argument, and the `timer` decorator will still work correctly."

The correct answer is C) After function call.

Explanation:
When the `@MyDecorator` syntax is used, Python internally calls `MyDecorator(my_function)` to create an instance of `MyDecorator`. This instance is then invoked with `my_function()` as its argument. The `__call__` method of `MyDecorator` is what gets executed when the decorated function is called. It first prints ""Before function call"", then executes the original function, and finally prints ""After function call"". Therefore, when `my_function()` is called, it will print:

```
Before function call
Inside the function
After function call

A) The `AsyncTimer` class is a decorator that can be applied to any coroutine function. When applied, it prints the current time every 2 seconds.
B) The `AsyncTimer` class defines a metaclass that modifies coroutine functions.
C) The `print_time` function will run indefinitely but will not print anything because it lacks an `await` statement within the loop.
D) The code will raise a `TypeError` because asyncio coroutines cannot be decorated with non-coroutine functions.";"A) The `AsyncTimer` class is a decorator that can be applied to any coroutine function. When applied, it prints the current time every 2 seconds.

Explanation: In this solution, the `AsyncTimer` class is designed as a decorator for asyncio coroutines. It uses a call method to wrap the coroutine and run it in an infinite loop with a sleep interval of 2 seconds between executions. This allows the coroutine `print_time` to be executed repeatedly at fixed intervals, printing the current time each time. Therefore, statement A accurately describes the behavior of the code."

Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to implement a simple memoization decorator for functions:

```python
from functools import wraps

def memoize(func):
    cache = {}
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        else:
            result = func(*args)
            cache[args] = result
            return result
    return wrapper

@memoize
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

However, this implementation has a critical flaw that affects its performance. What is the flaw and how can it be corrected?

A) The `cache` dictionary will grow indefinitely because there's no limit to the number of unique arguments that could be passed to the `fibonacci` function.

B) The decorator does not handle the case where the function might be called with non-hashable arguments, causing a TypeError.

C) The `cache` dictionary is being created inside the decorator, leading to each decorated function having its own separate cache. This can be corrected by moving the `cache` outside the decorator.

D) The decorator does not support keyword arguments, which would lead to issues when calling functions with keyword parameters.";"C) The `cache` dictionary is being created inside the decorator, leading to each decorated function having its own separate cache. This can be corrected by moving the `cache` outside the decorator.

The issue with the current implementation is that the `cache` dictionary is recreated every time the `memoize` decorator is applied to a function, resulting in each function having its own independent cache. This not only increases memory usage but also makes the memoization mechanism less effective because it does not share cached results between different instances of decorated functions.

To correct this, we need to move the `cache` dictionary outside the decorator so that it is shared across all decorated functions:

```python
from functools import wraps

cache = {}

def memoize(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        else:
            result = func(*args)
            cache[args] = result
            return result
    return wrapper

@memoize
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

With this change, the `cache` dictionary is shared across all instances of decorated functions, and memoization will work correctly for the `fibonacci` function."

Which of the following statements is true regarding the use and functionality of this decorator?

A) The `timer` decorator will correctly measure the execution time of any function it decorates, including `compute_sum`.

B) The `wrapper` function inside `timer` captures all arguments and keyword arguments passed to the decorated function and passes them along.

C) If another decorator is added above `@timer`, such as `@memoize`, it will not affect the execution time measurement by `timer`.

D) The `timer` decorator can be used with asynchronous functions without modification, but the output will not include any meaningful timing information.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A) This statement is incorrect because while the decorator itself works to measure execution time, it does not account for I/O operations if they are performed within the function. If `compute_sum` involves expensive I/O operations, their time would not be included in the measurement.

B) Correct. The `wrapper` function correctly captures and passes all arguments (`*args, **kwargs`) to the original function, ensuring that the decorator does not alter how functions are called.

C) True. Decorators are applied sequentially from top to bottom. If another decorator like `@memoize` is added above `@timer`, its effects would be isolated from the timing measurement by `timer`.

D) Incorrect. Asyncio can be used with decorators, and the timing would still correctly measure the CPU-bound time taken by the function, ignoring other asyncio-related tasks or I/O wait times that might not include in a simple timing measurement."

B) The first task starts immediately, but subsequent tasks wait for the previous one to finish before starting.

C) The tasks are executed sequentially, waiting for each one to complete before moving on to the next.

D) Each task delay is doubled with respect to the previous task due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) All tasks will start immediately upon calling `asyncio.gather` and complete concurrently.

Explanation:
- In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This means that even though asyncio allows for concurrent execution of I/O-bound tasks, CPU-bound tasks are still subject to the GIL.
- When using `asyncio.gather`, all tasks are scheduled concurrently by asyncio's event loop. The tasks start immediately upon being passed to `asyncio.gather`.
- Each task runs in parallel as long as it is waiting for I/O operations (like `await asyncio.sleep(delay)`). Since these tasks involve sleeping, they do not block the event loop, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.
- Therefore, all tasks will start immediately and complete concurrently, with each waiting for its specified delay. This behavior demonstrates how asyncio manages asynchronous tasks effectively without being constrained by the GIL in I/O-bound scenarios."

B) Entering context Fetching data... Exiting context Data fetched  
C) Fetching data... Data fetched Exiting context  
D) Entering context Data fetched Exiting context";"**Part 2 (Answer):**
The correct answer is B) Entering context Fetching data... Exiting context Data fetched.

Explanation:
- The `async with` statement is used to create an asynchronous context manager.
- When the `main` function runs, it enters the `AsyncContextManager` by calling its `__aenter__` method, which prints ""Entering context"".
- Next, it awaits the `fetch_data` coroutine, which prints ""Fetching data..."" and then waits for 2 seconds before returning ""Data fetched"".
- After `fetch_data` completes, the `main` function continues to print the returned data.
- The `async with` statement also calls the `__aexit__` method of the context manager, which prints ""Exiting context"".

The order of execution is clearly visible in the output, demonstrating how `__aenter__`, `await fetch_data()`, and `__aexit__` are executed in sequence."

Explanation:
- The `my_decorator` function modifies the `__new__` method of the class to print ""Decorator is called"" whenever an instance of `MyClass` is created.
- The metaclass `Meta` checks if the dictionary `dct` contains a key 'x'. If it does, it prints a message indicating that it added the attribute. In this case, since `MyClass` has an attribute `x = 5`, the metaclass will print ""Metaclass added attribute: 5"".

- Option B is incorrect because the `__init__` method of the `Singleton` class will only be called once when the first instance is created. Subsequent creations through the same metaclass will return the existing instance without reinitializing it.
- Option C is correct; the `_instances` dictionary uses the class (`cls`) as the key, which ensures that each subclass (if any) would have its own separate instance stored in the dictionary.

You are tasked with creating a decorator that can be applied to any function or method. This decorator should measure the execution time of the function it decorates, but only if the function returns a specific value. If the function does not return this specific value, the decorator should not record the execution time. Here's an example usage:

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The program will print ""Task 0 started"" before printing ""Task 1 started"".
B) The tasks are executed concurrently, but their completion order is not guaranteed.
C) All tasks must be completed in the order they were created.
D) The program will raise an error because asyncio.sleep() does not work with async functions.";"B) The tasks are executed concurrently, but their completion order is not guaranteed.

Explanation:
The code demonstrates the use of asyncio to execute multiple tasks concurrently. When `asyncio.gather` is used with multiple awaitable objects (in this case, asynchronous functions), it runs them all at the same time and waits for all to complete. The order in which the tasks start executing can be determined by Python's event loop scheduler, but there is no guarantee about their completion order. This makes option B correct while options A, C, and D are incorrect."

You are tasked with creating a Python decorator that measures the execution time of asynchronous functions. The decorator should be used on an async function, and it should return the time taken to execute the function.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

@async_execution_time
async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return ""Data fetched""

# Usage
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(fetch_data())
print(result)
```

The `async_execution_time` decorator is intended to measure and print the time taken by the `fetch_data` function when called. However, it is not implemented correctly.

Which of the following options correctly implements the `async_execution_time` decorator?

A) 
```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps

def async_execution_time(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f""Execution time: {end - start} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

B) 
```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps

def async_execution_time(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f""Execution time: {end - start} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

C) 
```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps

def async_execution_time(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()

        end = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f""Execution time: {end - start} seconds"")
        return result

        print(f""Execution time: {end - start} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper
```";"Answer: D

Explanation:
The correct implementation of the `async_execution_time` decorator is provided in option D. It uses `loop.time()` to measure the execution time correctly within an asynchronous context. The decorator wraps the original function and measures the time before and after the execution of the async function using the event loop's timing method, ensuring that the timing is accurate even when running inside an asyncio event loop."

Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a decorator which logs function calls with their arguments:

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The decorator will correctly log the function calls as expected.

B) The decorator will cause a runtime error because `functools.wraps` is not used.

C) The decorator will work but the logged arguments will be incorrect due to how `*args` and `**kwargs` are handled.

D) None of the above";"A) The decorator will correctly log the function calls as expected.

Explanation: This statement is true. The `functools.wraps` decorator is used correctly to preserve the metadata of the original function, including its name, docstring, and other attributes. Therefore, when the `add` function is called with arguments `(3, 4)`, it will print ""Calling add((3, 4), {})"" as expected. The use of `*args` and `**kwargs` in both the wrapper and the original function ensures that all positional and keyword arguments are correctly passed through."

    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
    
    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `log_method_calls` decorator only logs calls to methods in `Calculator`, but not in any subclass.
B) The `Meta` metaclass dynamically adds logging capabilities to all methods defined in any class that uses it as its metaclass.
C) When an instance of `Calculator` is created, `__init__` is called on the wrapped version of `Calculator`.
D) Calling `add(2, 3)` on an instance of `Calculator` will print ""Calling add with args: (2, 3), kwargs: {}"" and then return 5.";"B) The `Meta` metaclass dynamically adds logging capabilities to all methods defined in any class that uses it as its metaclass.

Explanation:
- The `log_method_calls` decorator wraps callable attributes of a class to add logging functionality. However, it is applied within the `Meta` metaclass.
- The `Meta` metaclass iterates over the attributes of the class being created and applies the `log_method_calls` decorator to any callable methods found.
- This means that all methods in classes defined with `Meta` as their metaclass will have logging capabilities added, not just those explicitly in `Calculator`.
- When an instance of a class using `Meta` is created, the `__init__` method of the metaclass's generated class is called. However, it does not modify the `__init__` method itself; it wraps any callable attributes to add logging.
- Calling `add(2, 3)` on an instance of `Calculator` will indeed print ""Calling add with args: (2, 3), kwargs: {}"" and then return 5, demonstrating that the decorator has been applied."

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) When an instance of `SubClass1` or `SubClass2` calls `auto_method()`, it will return ""Hello from SubClass1"" and ""Hello from SubClass2"" respectively.

B) The method `auto_method()` is added to all subclasses dynamically at runtime using the metaclass.

C) The `AutoAddMethodMeta` metaclass can only be used with classes that inherit directly from `Base`.

D) When an instance of any subclass calls `auto_method()`, it will always return ""Hello from Base"" because `Base` is the top-level class and defines the method.";"Part 2 (Answer):
B) The method `auto_method()` is added to all subclasses dynamically at runtime using the metaclass.

Explanation: 
The metaclass `AutoAddMethodMeta` is defined such that it adds a new method `auto_method` to any class that uses this metaclass, including its subclasses. This method returns a string indicating the name of the class where it was called from. Therefore, when an instance of either `SubClass1` or `SubClass2` calls `auto_method()`, it will correctly return ""Hello from SubClass1"" and ""Hello from SubClass2"", respectively.

Option A is incorrect because it incorrectly states what the method returns.
Option C is incorrect because there's no restriction on which classes can use this metaclass; any class defined with `metaclass=AutoAddMethodMeta` will have the method added.
Option D is incorrect because each subclass receives its own copy of the method, and it correctly reflects the class name where it was called."

C) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, both `method1` and `method2` will be called with additional debug prints before execution.
D) `MyClass` cannot have any non-callable attributes because the metaclass modifies only methods.";"B) The `DebugMeta` metaclass changes all callable attributes of a class to debug versions.

Explanation:
- The `debug_method` decorator wraps any callable (method, function) with additional debugging print statements.
- The `DebugMeta` metaclass uses `__prepare__` and `__new__` to apply the `debug_method` decorator to all callable items in the class dictionary before the class is fully created. This includes both methods (`method1` and `method2`) as well as any other callable attributes that might be added later.
- Therefore, when an instance of `MyClass` is created, calling either `method1` or `method2` will indeed include additional debug prints before the actual method execution, making option C true. However, since all callables are affected, option A and D are incorrect because they only apply to methods. Option B accurately describes the behavior of the metaclass."

**Explanation:** The `Meta` metaclass decorates all callable attributes of any class instantiated with it using the `my_decorator`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, both `method1` and `method2` are automatically wrapped by `my_decorator`, which adds pre- and post-function call print statements.

"2025-06-28 00:02";"**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print(""Connecting to database..."")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

Now, imagine you want to enhance this singleton behavior so that the instance creation is thread-safe. Modify the `SingletonMeta` metaclass accordingly.

A. Use `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method.
B. Replace the `_instances` dictionary with an `OrderedDict`.
C. Use a context manager for the lock.
D. Implement `__new__` instead of `__call__`.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A. Use `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method.

Explanation:
The correct answer is to use a `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method of the metaclass to ensure that instance creation is thread-safe. This approach involves creating an instance only if it does not already exist, and locking during this process to prevent multiple threads from creating different instances simultaneously. Here's how you can modify the code:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
                cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print(""Connecting to database..."")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

In this solution, the `_lock` attribute of the metaclass ensures that only one thread can enter the `if cls not in cls._instances` block at a time, thus guaranteeing that the singleton property is maintained even when accessed from multiple threads."

D. Both classes can have multiple instances, depending on how they are used in different parts of a program.";"**C. The `singleton` decorator and `SingletonMeta` metaclass both ensure that only one instance of their respective classes exists.**

Explanation: The provided decorator uses `time.time()` which returns the current CPU time, not the actual elapsed wall-clock time. When applied to an asynchronous function, the execution of the async function is not blocking the main thread, so `time.time()` before and after the call will return approximately the same value, leading to a zero execution time being printed. Additionally, since the decorator does not handle coroutines correctly, calling it with an `async` function will result in an error because the decorator expects synchronous functions."

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `LoggingMeta` metaclass automatically logs all attribute accesses for any method in a class it decorates.

B) The `log_access` static method transforms every callable (method or function) in a decorated class into a version that logs its access before executing.

C) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `__init__` method does not log its execution because it is not a callable.

D) Using this metaclass, all attribute accesses within any class using it would be logged, but only if they are explicitly defined in the `__dict__`.

Part 2 (Answer):
B) The `log_access` static method transforms every callable (method or function) in a decorated class into a version that logs its access before executing.

This statement is correct. The `LoggingMeta` metaclass uses ` setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_access(attr_name, dct[attr_name]))` to replace each method with a wrapped version of itself that logs access before calling the original method.

```

This code defines a `Timer` class to measure execution time and a decorator `measure_time` to wrap functions with timing functionality. The function `compute_sum` calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. 

**Question:**  
What is the output when running the provided code? Why does this occur?

A) It prints the elapsed time followed by the sum of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000.  
B) It only prints the sum of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000.  
C) It raises an error because `measure_time` does not handle exceptions.  
D) It measures and prints the execution time but fails to return any value.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is **A**.

Explanation:  
When you decorate a function with `@measure_time`, it wraps the original function (`compute_sum`) in a new function that starts a timer, calls the original function, measures the elapsed time, and then prints this time. The decorator returns the result of the original function, which is also returned by the wrapper. Therefore, running the code will print both the execution time (which is a positive number) followed by the sum of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000.

Options B and C are incorrect because there are no exceptions being raised or not handled correctly in this case. Option D is also incorrect because the function does return a value, which is the result of `compute_sum(1000000)`."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a simple cache mechanism for functions. The goal is to cache the results of function calls so that if the same arguments are passed again, the cached result is returned instead of recomputing it.

```python
from functools import wraps

def cache_results(func):
    cache = {}
    
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        else:
            result = func(*args)
            cache[args] = result
            return result
    
    return wrapper

@cache_results
def expensive_function(x):
    # Simulate an expensive computation
    print(f""Computing {x}"")
    return x * x

# Example usage
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should compute and cache the result
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should retrieve the cached result
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `cache_results` decorator correctly implements caching for the function it decorates.
B) The use of a dictionary to store the cache within the decorator is problematic and will lead to memory leaks.
C) The `wrapper` function does not need the `@wraps(func)` decorator because it's not essential for maintaining the original function's metadata.
D) The caching mechanism can be improved by making the cache thread-safe.";"[ANSWER] D

**Explanation:** The caching mechanism implemented in the code is correct, but the caching itself is not thread-safe. Multiple threads could potentially write to and read from the `cache` dictionary simultaneously without proper synchronization, which could lead to data corruption or race conditions. By using a thread-safe dictionary or implementing locks within the decorator, this issue can be resolved."

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior of `MyClass` when its methods are called?

A) When `method1(5)` is called, it prints ""Calling method1 with args: (5,), kwargs: {}"" and then returns 6.
B) When `method2(3)` is called, it returns 6 without any additional output.
C) The metaclass changes the behavior of all methods in `MyClass` to print debug information before and after the method call.
D) The metaclass does not modify the behavior of any methods, and calling `method1(5)` or `method2(3)` will produce the same results as without the metaclass.";"### Part 2 (Answer):
C) The metaclass changes the behavior of all methods in `MyClass` to print debug information before and after the method call.

Explanation:
The `MethodDecorator` metaclass iterates over all attributes of the class being defined. If an attribute is callable (i.e., a function or method) and does not start with double underscores, it wraps that function using the `method_decorator`. The decorator adds print statements to both the beginning and end of the function, allowing for debugging purposes without altering the original functionality of the method.

When methods `method1` and `method2` are called on an instance of `MyClass`, the metaclass's modifications ensure that they first print debug information about their call, then execute normally, and finally print the result. This behavior is observed in the provided code snippet where calling `MyClass().method1(5)` results in:

```
Calling method1 with args: (5,), kwargs: {}
method1 returned: 6
6
```"

You are tasked with creating a class decorator that measures the execution time of methods in a class. The decorator should only apply to instance methods that return integers, ensuring that it does not interfere with other types of methods.

Here's an example usage:

```python
@time_int_methods
class Example:
    def method1(self):
        return 42

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)
        return 100

    def method3(self):
        return ""Not an integer""
```

When `Example().method1()` is called, it should return 42 and print the execution time. However, calling `Example().method3()` should raise a TypeError.

Which of the following is a possible implementation of the `time_int_methods` decorator?

A) Using a class-based decorator:

```python
class TimeIntMethods:
    def __init__(self, cls):
        self.cls = cls

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        new_class = type(self.cls.__name__, (self.cls,), {})
        for name, method in self.cls.__dict__.items():
            if callable(method) and isinstance(method, int):
                setattr(new_class, name, self.time_int_method(method))
        return new_class

    def time_int_method(self, method):

        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = method(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            if not isinstance(result, int):
                raise TypeError(""Only integer methods are allowed"")
            print(f""Execution time of {method.__name__}: {end_time - start_time} seconds"")
            return result
        return wrapper
```

B) Using a function-based decorator:

```python
def time_int_methods(cls):
    new_class = type(cls.__name__, (cls,), {})
    for name, method in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(method) and isinstance(method, int):

    def __init__(self, cls):
        self.cls = cls

            return result
        return wrapper

D) Using a function-based decorator but incorrectly checking method type:

```python
def time_int_methods(cls):
    new_class = type(cls.__name__, (cls,), {})
    for name, method in cls.__dict__.items():

        print(f""Execution time of {method.__name__}: {end_time - start_time} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper
```";"A) Using a class-based decorator is correct because it properly handles the creation of a new class with the decorated methods, ensuring that only integer-returning methods are timed and validated. The function-based decorators in options B, C, and D incorrectly check whether the method is an instance of `int`, which will never be true since methods are not instances of integers."

A) Creating class MyClass  
Decorator called  

**Explanation:** 

The `MyClass` is decorated with `my_decorator`, and the metaclass of `MyClass` is `Meta`. The `__new__` method of the metaclass `Meta` gets called when `MyClass` is created, printing ""Creating class MyClass"". Then, the decorator `my_decorator` wraps the `__init__` method of `MyClass`, printing ""Decorator called"" every time an instance of `MyClass` is created. The order of operations here is first the metaclass creation and then the decoration, so the correct output is ""Creating class MyClass"" followed by ""Decorator called"".";"Answer format error.

D) Using `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` inside the decorator might lead to inaccurate timing due to context switching.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator does not handle exceptions that might be raised by the function it decorates.

Explanation:
The provided implementation of `async_time_decorator` is correct in terms of measuring the execution time for asynchronous functions. However, a potential issue with this approach is that it does not handle exceptions that might be raised during the execution of the decorated function. If an exception occurs inside the decorated function, the decorator will catch it and print a message indicating the time taken to execute (which would be 0 since no time has passed), but the original exception will be lost. A more robust solution would be to handle exceptions appropriately or pass them up to the caller:

```python
import asyncio

A) The `ResourceMeta` metaclass ensures that any subclass of `DataProcessor` must define a `resource_name`.

B) The `managed_resource` context manager will create and release a new instance of `Resource` every time it's used.

C) The `DataProcessor.process` method can be called without defining the `resource_name` in a subclass, as long as no resource is managed inside it.

D) The `Resource` class releases its resources automatically when garbage collected, regardless of whether it was managed by the context manager.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) This statement is true. The `ResourceMeta` metaclass checks for the presence of `resource_name` in any subclass of `DataProcessor`, ensuring that all subclasses define this attribute.

B) This statement is false. The `managed_resource` context manager creates and releases a new instance of `Resource` every time it's used within a `with` block, but it does not automatically create a new instance when called outside a `with` block.

C) This statement is false. If the `resource_name` is not defined in a subclass, an error will be raised during class creation due to the metaclass constraint enforced by `ResourceMeta`.

D) This statement is false. The `Resource` class does not release its resources automatically when garbage collected. Instead, it provides a method (`release`) that must be called explicitly to free up resources.";"**Detailed Explanation:**

- **A)** The metaclass ensures that all subclasses of `DataProcessor` are aware of the resource management protocol by requiring them to define a `resource_name`. This is a critical aspect for ensuring consistent behavior across different parts of an application when managing resources.
  
- **B)** The context manager is designed to handle the creation and cleanup of resources automatically within a `with` block. However, it does not create a new instance outside of this context, as its primary purpose is to manage resource lifecycle during execution.

- **C)** This statement misinterprets the role of the metaclass constraint. If the `resource_name` is missing, the subclass will not be created due to the error raised by `ResourceMeta`.

- **D)** Garbage collection in Python is designed to reclaim memory automatically when objects are no longer referenced. The `Resource` class provides a way to explicitly release resources, but it does not rely on garbage collection for resource management."

A) The method is added at runtime when an instance of `MyClass` is created.
B) The method is added at class definition time due to the metaclass's `__new__` method.
C) The method is added when an instance of a subclass of `MyClass` is created.
D) The method is not added, and `dynamic_method` will raise an AttributeError.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

B) The method is added at class definition time due to the metaclass's `__new__` method.

Explanation: In Python, when a class is defined using a metaclass, the metaclass’s `__new__` method is invoked to create the class object. In this case, the `DynamicMethodMeta.__new__` method adds the `dynamic_method` function directly to the dictionary of the class being created (`dct`).

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]  
**Part 2 (Answer):**

D) TypeError: Greeter must implement greet method

Explanation:

- The `Meta` metaclass checks if the `greet` method is implemented in any class that uses it. Since `Greeter` and `FriendlyGreeter` do not have a `greet` method, they would raise a `TypeError`. However, due to the decorator `@greet_decorator`, `Greeter` gets an additional `greet` method that prints ""Greetings!"" before calling the original `greet` method.
- The `WelcomeGreeter` class uses both the metaclass and the decorator. When `WelcomeGreeter` is instantiated, the `Meta` metaclass checks for the presence of a `greet` method, which does not exist in this case. Therefore, it raises a `TypeError`.
- Since the metaclass check fails before the decorator can be applied to `WelcomeGreeter`, option B and C cannot be correct.
- Option A is incorrect because all classes have the `greet` method due to the decorator.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior of this code when executed?

A) The `handle` method will be called synchronously, and it will block other tasks.

B) The `async_handle` method will be called asynchronously, but it will still block other tasks due to the use of `print`.

C) The `async_handle` method will run concurrently with other tasks thanks to asyncio's event loop.

D) The code will raise an error because `handle` cannot be made asynchronous using this metaclass.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct Answer: C) The `async_handle` method will run concurrently with other tasks thanks to asyncio's event loop.**

**Explanation:** 
The use of a metaclass (`AsyncHandlerMeta`) that converts an instance method `handle` into a static method `async_handle` is crucial here. This allows the original `handle` method, which was designed to be asynchronous (using `await`), to be called without needing to instantiate the class first. The metaclass transformation enables `async_handle` to be used as a regular coroutine within `main`, allowing other tasks (`task2`) to run concurrently due to asyncio's non-blocking nature. This demonstrates a practical use of metaclasses in enhancing the usability and flexibility of asynchronous methods."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator for logging method calls with their arguments:

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_method_calls(cls):
    for attr_name, attr_value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith('__'):
            setattr(cls, attr_name, wraps(attr_value)(log_call))
    return cls

def log_call(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f""Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f""{func.__name__} returned {result}"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_method_calls
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b
```

What potential issues could arise from this implementation of the `log_method_calls` decorator? Which option correctly identifies the main problem?

A) The decorator does not preserve the metadata of the original methods.

B) Calling an instance method will cause infinite recursion due to incorrect method binding.

C) It won't work with class methods or static methods, as they are bound differently.

D) The logging functionality can be disabled by simply removing the `@log_method_calls` decorator from the class definition.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) Calling an instance method will cause infinite recursion due to incorrect method binding.

Explanation: The current implementation of `log_method_calls` uses a loop to modify all callable attributes in the class. However, it does not correctly bind the logged methods back to their instances when called as instance methods. This leads to infinite recursion because each call to an instance method will attempt to log itself again and again, without resolving to the actual method implementation. To fix this, one would need to ensure that the wrapped methods are properly bound to instances using `method.__get__(self, cls)`."
"2025-07-04 08:02";"**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

    def connect(self):
        print(""Connecting to database..."")

# Example usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

Now, imagine you have a class `LoggingMeta` that logs the creation of instances. Modify the existing code to incorporate this new metaclass in a way that it seamlessly integrates with the `SingletonMeta` and respects the singleton pattern.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B.

Explanation: The task requires creating a metaclass that combines the functionality of both `SingletonMeta` and `LoggingMeta`. To achieve this, we need to ensure that the new metaclass inherits from both metaclasses. Here's how you can do it:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, dct):
        print(f""Creating class {name}"")
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, dct)

class DatabaseConnection(metaclass=SingletonMeta | LoggingMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print(""Connecting to database..."")

# Example usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

In this solution:
- We use Python's type hinting feature with `|` (pipe symbol, which is the bitwise OR operator in Python 3.10+). This syntax allows us to specify that `DatabaseConnection` should have the metaclass behavior of both `SingletonMeta` and `LoggingMeta`.
- The `__new__` method of `LoggingMeta` logs the creation of each class.
- When creating an instance of `DatabaseConnection`, both the singleton pattern and logging are respected."
"2025-07-04 16:01";"Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure that all instances of a class have unique names. However, there's a flaw in this implementation that could lead to unexpected behavior.

```python
class UniqueNameMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls.__name__ not in UniqueNameMeta._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            UniqueNameMeta._instances[cls.__name__] = instance

        self.name = name

# Example usage:
obj1 = MyClass(""Alice"")
obj2 = MyClass(""Alice"")

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Expected: False
```

Which of the following options correctly identifies and fixes the flaw in the provided code?

A) The `__call__` method should use `cls.name` instead of `cls.__name__` to ensure uniqueness.

B) A dictionary key collision might occur if two classes with the same name but different module names are created.

C) The metaclass should not store instances in a class variable `_instances`.

D) The code is correct as it already ensures that all instances have unique names.";"Part 2 (Answer):
B) A dictionary key collision might occur if two classes with the same name but different module names are created.

**Explanation**: The provided metaclass `UniqueNameMeta` uses the class's `__name__` attribute to store instances in a class variable `_instances`. This approach will cause a collision if two classes with the same name exist in different modules. For example, if you have `MyClass` in both `module1.py` and `module2.py`, they would be considered the same class by the metaclass, leading to incorrect behavior where instances of these ""same"" classes overwrite each other in the `_instances` dictionary."

```

What will be the output of this script when executed?

A) `Processed: Data fetched`
B) `Data fetched`
C) The program will hang indefinitely
D) An error will be thrown";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is A) `Processed: Data fetched`.

Explanation:

1. **Async Function `fetch_data`:**
   - This function simulates an asynchronous operation using `asyncio.sleep(1)` which suspends the execution for 1 second and then returns a string ""Data fetched"".

2. **Class `AsyncDecorator`:**
   - This class is designed to be used as a decorator to modify the behavior of async functions.
   - The `__init__` method takes an async function (`func`) as an argument and stores it.
   - The `__call__` method is defined to accept any number of positional arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).
   - Inside the `__call__` method, the async function is awaited, and then a string ""Processed: "" is prepended to the result.

3. **Decorator Application:**
   - The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator is applied to the `process_data` coroutine.
   - When `process_data` is called inside the `main` coroutine, it passes through the `AsyncDecorator`, which awaits the original `fetch_data` function and prepends ""Processed: "" to its result.

4. **Execution of `main`:**
   - The `asyncio.run(main())` statement runs the `main` coroutine, which in turn calls `process_data`.
   - Since `process_data` is decorated with `AsyncDecorator`, it first processes the data by prepending ""Processed: "" and then prints the result.

Therefore, the output of the script will be:
```
Processed: Data fetched
```"
"2025-07-05 08:02";"[QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a caching mechanism in Python that can be applied to any function. The cache should store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

Implement this caching mechanism as a decorator that can be applied to any function, using a metaclass to ensure that it works across different classes. Your solution should handle varying numbers of arguments and keyword arguments.

Here's a starting point for your implementation:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from functools import wraps

# Define the CacheMetaclass here
class CacheMetaclass(type):
    pass

# Define the caching decorator using CacheMetaclass
def cache(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        pass  # Your caching logic here
    return wrapper

# Example usage:
@cache
def expensive_function(x, y):
    print(""Computing..."")
    return x + y

# Create a class that uses the CacheMetaclass and applies the cache decorator
class CachingClass(metaclass=CacheMetaclass):
    @cache
    def compute(self, a, b):
        print(""Computing in class method..."")
        return a * b

# Test the implementation
print(expensive_function(2, 3))  # Should print ""Computing..."" and then return 5
print(expensive_function(2, 3))  # Should return 5 without recomputing
instance = CachingClass()
print(instance.compute(4, 5))  # Should print ""Computing in class method..."" and then return 20
print(instance.compute(4, 5))  # Should return 20 without recomputing";"[ANSWER] A

Explanation:
The correct answer is A. The provided solution uses a metaclass to ensure that the caching mechanism works across different classes and functions. It also correctly implements a caching decorator using `functools.wraps` for preserving the function's metadata.

To achieve this, you would define a `CacheMetaclass` as a subclass of `type`, which is used to create new types (classes). The `cache` decorator is then defined to handle caching logic. When applied to a function or method using the `@cache` syntax, it will store results based on the function's arguments and return cached results when the same inputs occur again.

The example usage demonstrates that the cache works correctly for both standalone functions and methods within a class, storing and returning computed values without recomputation when called with the same arguments."

B) The `greet` method will be added only to `MyClass` and not to `AnotherClass` or any subclasses.

C) The `greet` method will be added to all classes that inherit from `AnotherClass`, including `MyClass`.

D) The `greet` method will be added to `MyClass` but not to `AnotherClass`, unless explicitly defined in `AnotherClass`.";"### Part 2: Answer

A) The `greet` method will be added to both `MyClass` and `AnotherClass`, but not to any subclass of `AnotherClass`.

Explanation:
- In Python, metaclasses are used to create classes, and they can modify the class being created. In this case, the `Meta` metaclass adds a `greet` method to any class that uses it as their metaclass.
- When `MyClass` is defined with `metaclass=Meta`, the metaclass `Meta` modifies `MyClass` by adding the `greet` method.
- Similarly, when `AnotherClass` inherits from both `Meta` and `MyClass`, it also inherits the `greet` method because `MyClass` already has it due to being modified by `Meta`.
- However, any subclass of `AnotherClass` will not have the `greet` method unless explicitly defined in that subclass. This is because `AnotherClass` does not inherit from a metaclass that adds `greet`, only from `MyClass`."

A) The `MyClass` will not be decorated because decorators cannot be applied to classes.
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print: ""Initializing MyClass with args: (1, 2), kwargs: {}"".

D) An AttributeError will occur when trying to create an instance of `MyClass`.";"Part 2 (Answer): B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print: ""Initializing MyClass with args: (1, 2), kwargs: {}"".

Explanation: The decorator `debug_class` wraps the original `__init__` method of `MyClass`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the modified `__init__` method is called, which first prints debug information and then calls the original `__init__` method. Therefore, when you create an instance with arguments (1, 2), it will output the specified message followed by initializing the class attributes."

What is the primary issue with this code, and how would you correct it to ensure that `fetch_data` runs asynchronously as intended?

A) The `AsyncDecorator` should use `async def` instead of `def`.

C) `await asyncio.sleep(1)` is unnecessary in the decorator.
D) The `main` function needs to be decorated with `@asyncio.coroutine`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The `AsyncDecorator` does not handle asynchronous functions correctly.

The issue lies in how the `AsyncDecorator` is applied to an asynchronous function. When a function is marked as async, it returns a coroutine object that must be awaited to execute. However, the current implementation of the decorator tries to run the coroutine using `run_until_complete`, which blocks the event loop rather than allowing other tasks to run concurrently.

To correct this, you should either modify the decorator to return the coroutine directly and let the caller decide when to run it, or refactor the code to use async/await more effectively.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

**Question:** Why is `obj.new_attr` not being set to `""default_value""` as intended? What can be done to fix this issue?

A) The metaclass is not correctly adding the attribute because it is being called before any attributes are defined in the class.
B) The metaclass is incorrectly overriding an existing attribute with the same name, but there isn't one.
C) The attribute assignment should happen during the initialization of each instance instead of during the class creation.

**A) The metaclass is not correctly adding the attribute because it is being called before any attributes are defined in the class.**

This option is incorrect because the metaclass is actually trying to add `new_attr` when no other attributes exist, which is its intended behavior.

**B) The metaclass is incorrectly overriding an existing attribute with the same name, but there isn't one.**

This option is also incorrect for the same reason as A; there is no conflicting attribute in this case.

**C) The attribute assignment should happen during the initialization of each instance instead of during the class creation.**

This option is correct. The issue arises because the metaclass adds `new_attr` when the class is created, but if an instance-specific value needs to be set, it must be done during the initialization of that instance.

**D) There is no issue; `obj.new_attr` will be set to `""default_value""` after running this code.**

This option is incorrect because, as explained in option C, the attribute assignment should happen during instance creation, not class creation.

The correct fix involves ensuring that any additional attributes are assigned within an `__init__` method if they need to vary per instance or conditionally."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class with a custom behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'x' not in dct:
            dct['x'] = 0

A) 0  
B) 1  
C) AttributeError: 'SubClass' object has no attribute 'x'  
D) TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'dct'";"A) 0

The metaclass `Meta` ensures that any class created with it will have an attribute `x` initialized to 0. When `SubClass` is defined, it inherits from `MyClass`, which uses the `Meta` metaclass. Therefore, `SubClass` will also have the attribute `x` set to 0."

D) Task started

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Task started  
   Decorated task completed  
   Task completed  

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is A. The `TaskDecorator` class can be used to decorate both regular synchronous functions and asynchronous coroutines in Python. When you use the decorator on an async function, it simply calls the original function without any modification since the decorator does not perform any actions that would conflict with the async nature of the coroutine.

The output will be:

```
Task started
Decorated task completed
Task completed

A) Using resource  
B) Resource acquired  
C) Resource released  
D) Error";"C) Resource released

Explanation: When `use_resource()` is called, it enters a context manager by using the `with` statement. The `managed_resource` decorator wraps around the generator function `acquire_resource`, which yields ""resource"". When control leaves the `with` block, the context manager's `__exit__` method is called, which in turn calls `release_resource(resource)`. Therefore, ""Resource released"" will be printed after ""Using resource"". The generator itself does not contribute to any output outside of its yield statement."

Explanation: In the given code, the `wrapper` function returns an instance of the new class type created by `type(cls.__name__, (cls,), {})`, which is essentially a subclass of the original class. However, it does not properly inherit from the original class in the way that decorators are supposed to work.

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class. However, it doesn't fully prevent multiple instances from being created when used in certain ways. Your task is to modify the metaclass or add another mechanism to ensure true singularity.

    _instances = {}

print(s1 is s2)  # Should ideally print True but might not due to certain issues with metaclasses
```

What could be improved in the `SingletonMeta` class or an additional approach that would ensure true singularity of the `Singleton` class?

A) Ensure that `__new__` is overridden instead of `__call__`.

B) Use a lock to synchronize access to `_instances` dictionary.

C) Store instances in a global dictionary outside the metaclass.

D) Implement `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__` methods to prevent copying of singleton instances.";"Part 2 (Answer):
B) Use a lock to synchronize access to `_instances` dictionary.

Explanation:
The current implementation of the `SingletonMeta` class uses `__call__`, which can lead to race conditions when multiple threads try to create an instance simultaneously. By using a lock, we ensure that only one thread can execute the creation logic at a time, thus preventing the creation of multiple instances even in multi-threaded environments.

Here's how you could modify the code:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock = threading.Lock()

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
                cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # This will correctly print True
```

Option A is incorrect because `__new__` should not be used in this context as it bypasses the `__call__` mechanism which is crucial for metaclass-based singletons.

Option C is generally considered bad practice and can lead to memory leaks or other issues.

Option D is not relevant to ensuring singularity of a class; it's more about object copying, which doesn't affect the singleton pattern directly."

C. Calling add with args: (3,), kwargs: {value: None}
D. Error";"B. Calling add with args: (2,), kwargs: {value: 3}

Explanation: The decorator `@add(2)` attempts to log the call to the `add` function with the provided arguments. However, since the method `add_to_result` is decorated and does not have explicit positional or keyword parameters, the argument `2` passed to `@add(2)` does not directly affect how `add` is called within `add_to_result`. The actual call to `add` from `add_to_result` uses the default value of `None` for its second parameter because no arguments were explicitly passed.

What will be the output of the code when executed?

A) One second has passed
B) Timer ended in 0.5 seconds
C) Timer ended in 2.0 seconds
D) Timer ended in 3.0 seconds

Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is D) Timer ended in 3.0 seconds.

Explanation:
When the `AsyncTimer` context manager is entered, it records the start time using `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()`. The coroutine inside the `with` block then sleeps for 1 second twice, totaling 2 seconds of sleep. However, the total execution time from when the context manager is entered to when it's exited includes these sleep durations plus the time taken by the `__aexit__` method to calculate and print the elapsed time.

The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time as follows:
- Start time: Recorded at the beginning of the context manager.
- End time: When the coroutine inside the block finishes executing.
- Elapsed time: Difference between end time and start time, which is 2 seconds (sleep durations) plus the negligible time taken by `__aexit__` itself.

Thus, when the output is printed, it shows ""Timer ended in 3.0 seconds,"" indicating that the total execution time includes both sleep durations."

A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.
B) The print statement inside the wrapper function is not thread-safe.
C) The decorator incorrectly calculates the execution time due to overlapping times.
D) The `wrapper` function returns a coroutine instead of the result.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The decorator incorrectly calculates the execution time due to overlapping times.

Explanation: The issue arises because each call to `compute_sum(1000000)` within another iterable context does not re-run the `timing_decorator`. Instead, it uses the same timing information from the first run of the function. This leads to incorrect and overlapping timing results. To fix this, ensure that the decorator measures execution time independently for each call, possibly by moving the print statement inside the wrapper's conditional block or using a different approach to measure time in each iteration.";"Answer format error.

D) The instance will be created successfully with invalid data.";"A) The metaclass will raise a `TypeError`, preventing the creation of the instance.

Explanation:
When you attempt to create an instance of the `User` class with invalid data, the metaclass `ValidateMeta` checks if the subclass implements the `validate_data` method during the class creation. Since the `User` class does implement this method and the validation logic correctly raises a `ValueError`, the metaclass does not raise any errors. However, when an instance of `User` is created with invalid data (non-string name or age outside the valid range), the `validate_data` method will indeed raise a `ValueError`. But since this error occurs at runtime during the initialization of the instance, the `TypeError` from the metaclass is raised before reaching the `validate_data` call.

# Actual output (varies depending on the system): 
# compute_sum(1000000) took -1.0 seconds to execute.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A: The issue is that `time.time()` returns a floating-point number of seconds since the epoch, not an integer. Printing `-1.0` seconds to execute suggests an error in capturing the end time correctly.

Correct answer: B

Explanation:
The problem lies in how the timing is calculated. When calculating the duration, it's crucial to subtract the start time from the end time accurately. The code currently calculates `end_time - start_time` but does not ensure that both times are correctly captured. In some cases, especially under heavy load or on slower systems, this might lead to negative durations which don't make sense in a real-world scenario.

To fix the issue, we should ensure that the timing calculation is done correctly. Here's how you can correct it:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()  # Capture the start time before calling the function
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()  # Capture the end time after the function has executed
        print(f""{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds to execute."")
        return result

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

# Expected output:
# compute_sum(1000000) took 0.0023456789012345678 seconds to execute.

Option A is incorrect because it suggests uniqueness based on the object's identity rather than its class. Option C is not directly supported by this pattern, as it only ensures per-class uniqueness.

Explanation: 
The Singleton class is designed to ensure that only one instance of the class can exist. In this implementation, the `__new__` method uses a lock to synchronize access, ensuring thread safety when creating instances. When multiple threads attempt to create an instance simultaneously, only one will succeed due to the lock.

In the main block, a single instance of `Singleton` is created and then passed to 10 threads, each of which calls `thread_task`. Since all threads are passed the same instance of `Singleton`, they will print the same memory address (ID) for this instance. Therefore, the output will be the same thread ID printed 10 times."

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to track the execution time of functions. Your task is to modify this code so that it also tracks the number of times each function has been called.

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute."")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def expensive_function():
    for i in range(1000000):
        pass

# Call the function a few times
for _ in range(3):
    expensive_function()
```

Which of the following modifications should be made to `timer` to track both execution time and call count?

A) Add a counter dictionary inside the wrapper and increment it each time the function is called.

B) Use a closure to maintain a separate counter for each decorated function.

C) Introduce a global variable that increments each time any function decorated by `timer` is called.

D) Modify the decorator to use a context manager instead of a function wrapper.";"### Part 2 (Answer):
**B)** Use a closure to maintain a separate counter for each decorated function.

Explanation:
- The original `timer` decorator wraps a function and prints its execution time. To track how many times the function has been called, we need a way to keep track of this count separately for each function.
- A closure (an inner function that captures variables from an enclosing scope) allows us to maintain state between function calls without using global variables or classes.
- By creating a counter inside the `wrapper` function and incrementing it every time the function is called, we can achieve our goal of tracking both execution time and call count. This approach ensures that each decorated function maintains its own independent count of how many times it has been invoked."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method `greet` to any class it decorates. The goal is to understand how this works under the hood and what implications it might have on memory management.

```python
class Greeter(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f""Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}!""
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Greeter):
    pass

# Usage
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.greet())
```

What is the output of this code, and what does it demonstrate about how metaclasses interact with class creation?

A) `Hello from MyClass!` - Demonstrates that metaclasses can dynamically add methods to classes.

B) `AttributeError` - Indicates that adding a method dynamically via a metaclass is not possible in Python.

C) `None` - Shows that metaclasses do not modify existing classes but rather create new ones.

D) Memory error due to excessive memory usage during class creation.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) `Hello from MyClass!` - Demonstrates that metaclasses can dynamically add methods to classes."
