**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that aims to create a decorator for asynchronous functions. The goal is to measure the execution time of an async function. However, the current implementation does not work as expected.

```python
import asyncio

def time_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def sample_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return ""Done""

# Running the function to test
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(sample_async_function())
```

What is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed?

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
B) The decorator works as expected, but the output format is incorrect.  
C) The decorator should use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):` instead of `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`.  
D) The decorator should not measure execution time for asynchronous functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
Explanation: The issue with the code lies in how the timing is being recorded. Since `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a function that provides the current time, it should be called directly to get the actual timestamp, not awaited. The correct usage would be `start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` and `end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`. This will give the current event loop's time in seconds when the function starts and ends, allowing the difference to calculate execution time.

Imagine you are developing a web application where users can upload files. You want to ensure that only specific types of files (e.g., .txt, .pdf) can be uploaded. To achieve this, you decide to use decorators and metaclasses in Python.

You create a decorator `@allowed_file_types` that checks if the file type is allowed. Then, you define a metaclass `FileTypeMeta` that automatically applies the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to any class derived from it, setting the allowed types as a parameter.

Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```python
def allowed_file_types(*types):
    def wrapper(cls):
        cls.allowed_types = types
        return cls
    return wrapper

class FileTypeMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'allowed_types' not in dct:
            dct['allowed_types'] = ()
        super_new = super(FileTypeMeta, cls).__new__
        return super_new(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AllowedFiles(metaclass=FileTypeMeta):
    pass

class TextFile(AllowedFiles):
    # TODO: Apply the allowed_file_types decorator here
    pass

# Example usage:
txt_file = TextFile()
print(txt_file.allowed_types)  # Should print ('.txt',)
```

Which of the following ways can you correctly apply the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to the `TextFile` class using the metaclass?

A) Use a direct assignment in the class definition.
B) Override the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute.
C) Use a class variable directly within the class definition.
D) Call the `@allowed_file_types` decorator directly on the class.";"Part 2 (Answer): 
A) Direct assignment is not an option because decorators are applied before the class is fully defined, and direct assignment would occur after the class is created.

B) Correct. By overriding the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute, you can ensure that any subclass of `AllowedFiles` will have its `allowed_types` attribute set by default if not explicitly provided.

C) This would work but doesn't utilize the decorator mechanism and isn't as clean or flexible as using a metaclass.

D) Calling the decorator directly on the class is also not correct because it bypasses the metaclass's influence, which should be used to set the `allowed_types` attribute."

You are developing a Python library that needs to provide thread-safe logging functionality. You want to ensure that log messages from different threads do not interfere with each other, even when they are written simultaneously. Implement a decorator that can be applied to any function to make it thread-safe using locks.

```python
import threading

# Your solution goes here

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    # Decorator code
    pass

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

Choose the correct implementation for the `thread_safe_logger` decorator:

A)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    with lock:
        print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

C)  
```python
def thread_safe_logger(func):
    lock = threading.Lock()
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

D)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            print(f""Log: {message}"")
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```";"B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

**Explanation**: The correct implementation is option B. In this solution, the `lock` is defined outside of the decorator function so that it is not recreated with each decorated function call. This ensures that all calls to the decorated functions use the same lock, making the logging thread-safe."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator to measure the execution time of any function it decorates:

```python
import time

def time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

However, there is a common pitfall with this decorator that can lead to incorrect measurements. What is the issue with this code and how would you fix it?

A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

B) The decorator captures the start time too late, leading to inaccurate timing.

C) The decorator does not allow the function to be called without any arguments.

D) The decorator does not account for recursive calls properly.";"A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

**Explanation:**
The provided decorator `time_decorator` is synchronous and will measure the total execution time of a synchronous function by capturing the start time before the function call and the end time after the function call. However, it does not account for the case where the function itself might be a coroutine (an asynchronous function). To handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly, you would need to modify the decorator to check if the decorated function is a coroutine using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`. If it is, you should use an asynchronous version of time measurement with `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete`.

A corrected version of the decorator that handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions might look like this:

```python
import asyncio
import time
import inspect

def time_decorator(func):
    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    else:
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

This version of the decorator uses conditional logic to determine whether to measure synchronous or asynchronous functions."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

        await asyncio.sleep(0.3)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `Timer` class can be used as a context manager for synchronous tasks.
B) The `Timer` class does not support asynchronous execution and will block when used in an async context.
C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.
D) Only ""Task 1"" will be able to complete successfully due to a bug.";"C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.

Explanation: The `Timer` class is designed as an asynchronous context manager, which means it can be used in an async block (`async with`). The `__aenter__` method records the start time using `time.time()` and prints a message when entering the block. The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time after exiting the block and prints it. Both tasks, ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"", will run concurrently due to their usage within an async context manager (`async with`). Therefore, both tasks will measure their execution time accurately and print it to the console."
"2025-04-28 00:01";"### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes dynamically:

```python
class AddMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['add_method'] = lambda self, x: x + 5
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddMethodMeta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.add_method(10))  # Output?
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.

B) The output will be an error because `add_method` is not defined in `MyClass`.

C) The output will be `None` because metaclasses do not affect method definitions.

D) The code will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot add methods dynamically.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.**

This is the correct answer. In Python, metaclasses allow you to customize class creation by modifying or extending the class definition before it's finalized. In this case, the `AddMethodMeta` metaclass dynamically adds a method named `add_method` to any class it's applied to. When we create an instance of `MyClass`, it gains access to this new method, which simply returns its argument incremented by 5.

The line `print(obj.add_method(10))` will therefore output `15`."

Which of the following statements is true about this code? Select all correct answers:

A) The metaclass `Meta` checks if the subclass has a `greet` method before allowing it to be instantiated.
B) The `greeting_decorator` modifies the `greet` method of any class it decorates, adding a greeting message at the beginning.
C) When `person.greet()` is called, it will first print ""Hello from Person"" and then ""I am a person"".
D) Both A and B are correct.";"[ANSWER] D

Explanation:
A) The metaclass `Meta` correctly checks if the subclass has a `greet` method. If not, it raises a `TypeError`, which is true.
B) The `greeting_decorator` correctly modifies the `greet` method by adding a greeting message at the beginning, which is also true.

What is the expected output of this code? Why does it behave that way?

A) The output will be 1000 because all increments are performed atomically.

B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

C) The output will be more than 1000 due to extra increments caused by thread switching.

D) The program will raise an exception due to improper use of the lock.";"B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

Explanation:
- The decorator `@thread_safe` is intended to ensure that the `increment` method of `SharedResource` is thread-safe by using a lock.
- However, the lock object is created inside the wrapper function for each call. This means that each `increment` call will use its own separate lock instead of sharing the same one across threads.
- Since each thread uses its own lock and does not block other threads from reading and writing to `value`, race conditions can still occur.
- Therefore, the final value of `resource.value` will be less than 1000, as multiple increments might be incorrectly applied."

You are tasked with creating a Python application that needs to track the creation of all instances of a certain class. You decide to use a metaclass for this purpose. Here is a partially complete code snippet:

```python

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(InstanceTracker._instances)  # Expected output: {'MyClass': [obj1, obj2]}

Which line of code should be added to the `__new__` method in the `InstanceTracker` metaclass to track the creation of instances?

A) `cls._instances[name].append(instance)`
B) `self._instances[name] = []`
C) `self._instances[name].append(self())`
D) `self._instances[name].append(new_class())`";"[ANSWER] C

Explanation:
In the provided code, we need to track the creation of instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass. The current implementation does not add any logic to track instances. 

Option A is incorrect because `instance` is not defined in the scope where this line would be executed.
Option B is incorrect because it attempts to create a new list for each class but does not append any instances to it.
Option C is correct because it appends an instance of the newly created class to a list associated with the class name. The `self()` call inside `append` creates a new instance of the class, which is then added to the list stored in `_instances`.
Option D is incorrect because it tries to append the metaclass itself rather than an instance of the class.

Adding this line to the `__new__` method will correctly track and store instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass."

B) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. After that, the program will print nothing as the timer is not running any more tasks.

C) The coroutine starts and stays alive indefinitely because the timer keeps scheduling itself to run every 3 seconds.

D) There will be an error because adding a task to the `AsyncTimer` instance does not start it immediately.";"A) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. The timer runs in an infinite loop every 3 seconds, but since there's only one task, it doesn't add any complexity.

The `run` method of the `AsyncTimer` class is designed to run indefinitely, continuously waiting for all tasks to complete before sleeping for the specified interval. Since the `my_coroutine` is added with a sleep duration of 2 seconds, it will complete after 2 seconds and then wait again for the next iteration of the timer loop (every 3 seconds).

The correct answer is D. The metaclass `Meta` dynamically adds a new attribute to each integer attribute in the class, but it only affects attributes named with a single letter ('x', 'z'). This is because when the `Meta` metaclass iterates over all attributes, it includes inherited attributes as well. In this case, since 'y' is not an integer, no additional attribute is added for it. The '__new__' method of the metaclass is included in the class dictionary because metaclasses define their own `__new__` method to create and return a new class object."

        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    x = 10
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) When `MyClass` is defined, it does not raise any errors.
B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.
C) The metaclass `Meta` can be used to enforce that all classes inheriting from `MyClass` must also define an attribute `x`.
D) The metaclass `Meta` cannot be instantiated directly.";"B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because the code does not run without errors. It raises a `TypeError` during class creation.
- Option C is incorrect because metaclasses like `Meta` control the creation of classes, not their inheritance.
- Option D is correct because a metaclass itself is just a class that inherits from `type`, and it can be instantiated as any other class.
- Option B is correct. The metaclass `Meta` checks if the attribute `x` is present in the class dictionary when the class is being created. If it's not, it raises a `TypeError`."

You are tasked with creating a context manager that logs the time taken for each block of code it decorates. However, you want this logging to be performed asynchronously, so that it does not block the main execution flow. Your task is to design such a context manager using Python's `asyncio` library.

Here's a partially implemented version of your context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f""Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds"")

# Example usage:
async def main():
    async with AsyncTimerContextManager() as timer:
        # Simulate some asynchronous work
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print(""Work completed!"")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

However, this code has an issue: it does not correctly handle exceptions that might occur within the `with` block. You need to ensure that any exceptions raised inside the `with` block are propagated and handled by the caller of `async with`.

What change should you make to the `AsyncTimerContextManager` class to correctly propagate exceptions?

A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

B) Wrap the code that calculates and logs the duration in a try-except block.

C) Remove the `return self` statement from the `__aenter__` method.

D) Change the `log_time_taken` method to be an instance method instead of a static method.";"A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

The correct answer is A. In the `__aexit__` method, you should add a condition to check if an exception occurred (`if exc_type`). If an exception did occur, you should re-raise it using `raise exc_val from exc_tb`. This ensures that any exceptions raised within the `with` block are propagated and handled correctly by the caller of `async with`.

Here's the corrected version of the context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        if exc_type is None:
            await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)
        else:
            raise exc_val from exc_tb

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f""Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds"")

# Example usage remains the same
```

This implementation ensures that exceptions are correctly propagated, allowing for proper error handling in the code using the context manager."

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def task1():
    print(""Task 1 started"")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print(""Task 1 finished"")

async def task2():
    print(""Task 2 started"")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(""Task 2 finished"")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2())
    print(""All tasks completed"")

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the output of this script?

A) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", followed by ""Task 2 started"", then ""Task 1 finished"", and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

B) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 1 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

C) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", followed by ""Task 2 started"", and both tasks will finish concurrently without waiting for the other.

D) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 2 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, but ""Task 1 finished"" will not print because it takes longer to complete.";"B) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 1 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

Explanation: 
- The `asyncio.gather` function runs multiple coroutines concurrently.
- When both tasks start, they print their start messages immediately.
- However, since `task2` completes first (after 1 second), its completion is printed next.
- After a total of 2 seconds, the completion of `task1` is printed."

**Question:** Consider the following Python code snippet which uses a metaclass to ensure that only one instance of a class can be created:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: ?
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the output of `print(db1 is db2)`?

A) True  
B) False  
C) The code will raise an error  
D) None of the above";"**Answer:** A) True

**Explanation:**  
The provided metaclass, `SingletonMeta`, ensures that only one instance of any class using it can be created. In this case, when `db1` and `db2` are instantiated from the `Database` class, the `__call__` method of the metaclass is invoked. Since `_instances[cls]` is checked for `SingletonMeta`, and since no other instance exists in `_instances`, both `db1` and `db2` will reference the same instance stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run"")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr, value in dct.items():
            if callable(value) and not attr.startswith(""__""):
                dct[attr] = timing_decorator(value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Timer(metaclass=TimingMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def add(self, other):
        return self.value + other

    def multiply(self, other):
        return self.value * other
```

When an instance of the `Timer` class is created and its methods are called, which aspects of the code will be affected by both the decorator and metaclass?

A) The creation of the `Timer` class itself will be timed.

B) All callable methods of the `Timer` instances will have their execution time printed.

C) Only the `add` method's execution time will be printed.

D) The `multiply` method's result will be printed instead of its execution time.";"[B] Both A and B are correct."
"2025-05-02 16:01";"**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to count the number of times a function is called:

```python
def counter(func):
    func.count = 0
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        func.count += 1
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@counter
def my_function():
    pass

# Now call the function multiple times and print its count
my_function()
print(my_function.count)  # Expected output: 1
my_function()
print(my_function.count)  # Expected output: 2
```

Which of the following statements is true about the `counter` decorator and the `my_function` when it's decorated?

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

B) The `wrapper` function does not have access to the `count` attribute because it is a local variable in the `counter` function.

C) Each call to `my_function` creates a new instance of the `counter` decorator.

D) When `my_function` is decorated, the `func.count` attribute is set to 1 immediately and then incremented by 1 each time the function is called.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

Explanation:
- A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it. In this case, the `counter` decorator is designed to keep track of how many times the decorated function (`my_function`) has been called.
- The `wrapper` function inside the `counter` decorator has access to all non-local variables, including those defined in enclosing functions. Therefore, it can modify the `count` attribute which was set on the original function object when it was passed to the decorator.
- Each call to `my_function()` increments the `count` by 1, demonstrating that the `func.count` attribute is indeed being updated correctly with each invocation.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."
"2025-05-03 00:01";"";"**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator for an asynchronous function to measure its execution time:

```python
import asyncio

def time_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)

@time_decorator
async def async_task():

    return ""Task Completed""

# Example usage
asyncio.run(async_task())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

B) The use of `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` inside the wrapper function is incorrect and will raise an error.

C) The `@time_decorator` syntax applies the decorator to any synchronous or asynchronous function without modification.

D) The execution time measurement is accurate but can be improved by using a more precise timer.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

Explanation: The code uses `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` to get the current time asynchronously, which is appropriate for measuring the execution time of an asyncio function. This method ensures that the timing does not interfere with other tasks running in the event loop. The decorator works as intended and provides accurate execution time measurements for asynchronous functions."
