**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that aims to create a decorator for asynchronous functions. The goal is to measure the execution time of an async function. However, the current implementation does not work as expected.

```python
import asyncio

def time_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def sample_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return ""Done""

# Running the function to test
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(sample_async_function())
```

What is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed?

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
B) The decorator works as expected, but the output format is incorrect.  
C) The decorator should use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):` instead of `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`.  
D) The decorator should not measure execution time for asynchronous functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
Explanation: The issue with the code lies in how the timing is being recorded. Since `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a function that provides the current time, it should be called directly to get the actual timestamp, not awaited. The correct usage would be `start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` and `end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`. This will give the current event loop's time in seconds when the function starts and ends, allowing the difference to calculate execution time.

Imagine you are developing a web application where users can upload files. You want to ensure that only specific types of files (e.g., .txt, .pdf) can be uploaded. To achieve this, you decide to use decorators and metaclasses in Python.

You create a decorator `@allowed_file_types` that checks if the file type is allowed. Then, you define a metaclass `FileTypeMeta` that automatically applies the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to any class derived from it, setting the allowed types as a parameter.

Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```python
def allowed_file_types(*types):
    def wrapper(cls):
        cls.allowed_types = types
        return cls
    return wrapper

class FileTypeMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'allowed_types' not in dct:
            dct['allowed_types'] = ()
        super_new = super(FileTypeMeta, cls).__new__
        return super_new(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AllowedFiles(metaclass=FileTypeMeta):
    pass

class TextFile(AllowedFiles):
    # TODO: Apply the allowed_file_types decorator here
    pass

# Example usage:
txt_file = TextFile()
print(txt_file.allowed_types)  # Should print ('.txt',)
```

Which of the following ways can you correctly apply the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to the `TextFile` class using the metaclass?

A) Use a direct assignment in the class definition.
B) Override the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute.
C) Use a class variable directly within the class definition.
D) Call the `@allowed_file_types` decorator directly on the class.";"Part 2 (Answer): 
A) Direct assignment is not an option because decorators are applied before the class is fully defined, and direct assignment would occur after the class is created.

B) Correct. By overriding the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute, you can ensure that any subclass of `AllowedFiles` will have its `allowed_types` attribute set by default if not explicitly provided.

C) This would work but doesn't utilize the decorator mechanism and isn't as clean or flexible as using a metaclass.

D) Calling the decorator directly on the class is also not correct because it bypasses the metaclass's influence, which should be used to set the `allowed_types` attribute."

You are developing a Python library that needs to provide thread-safe logging functionality. You want to ensure that log messages from different threads do not interfere with each other, even when they are written simultaneously. Implement a decorator that can be applied to any function to make it thread-safe using locks.

```python
import threading

# Your solution goes here

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    # Decorator code
    pass

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

Choose the correct implementation for the `thread_safe_logger` decorator:

A)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    with lock:
        print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

C)  
```python
def thread_safe_logger(func):
    lock = threading.Lock()
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

D)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            print(f""Log: {message}"")
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```";"B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

**Explanation**: The correct implementation is option B. In this solution, the `lock` is defined outside of the decorator function so that it is not recreated with each decorated function call. This ensures that all calls to the decorated functions use the same lock, making the logging thread-safe."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator to measure the execution time of any function it decorates:

```python
import time

def time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

However, there is a common pitfall with this decorator that can lead to incorrect measurements. What is the issue with this code and how would you fix it?

A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

B) The decorator captures the start time too late, leading to inaccurate timing.

C) The decorator does not allow the function to be called without any arguments.

D) The decorator does not account for recursive calls properly.";"A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

**Explanation:**
The provided decorator `time_decorator` is synchronous and will measure the total execution time of a synchronous function by capturing the start time before the function call and the end time after the function call. However, it does not account for the case where the function itself might be a coroutine (an asynchronous function). To handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly, you would need to modify the decorator to check if the decorated function is a coroutine using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`. If it is, you should use an asynchronous version of time measurement with `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete`.

A corrected version of the decorator that handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions might look like this:

```python
import asyncio
import time
import inspect

def time_decorator(func):
    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    else:
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

This version of the decorator uses conditional logic to determine whether to measure synchronous or asynchronous functions."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

        await asyncio.sleep(0.3)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `Timer` class can be used as a context manager for synchronous tasks.
B) The `Timer` class does not support asynchronous execution and will block when used in an async context.
C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.
D) Only ""Task 1"" will be able to complete successfully due to a bug.";"C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.

Explanation: The `Timer` class is designed as an asynchronous context manager, which means it can be used in an async block (`async with`). The `__aenter__` method records the start time using `time.time()` and prints a message when entering the block. The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time after exiting the block and prints it. Both tasks, ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"", will run concurrently due to their usage within an async context manager (`async with`). Therefore, both tasks will measure their execution time accurately and print it to the console."
"2025-04-28 00:01";"### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes dynamically:

```python
class AddMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['add_method'] = lambda self, x: x + 5
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddMethodMeta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.add_method(10))  # Output?
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.

B) The output will be an error because `add_method` is not defined in `MyClass`.

C) The output will be `None` because metaclasses do not affect method definitions.

D) The code will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot add methods dynamically.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.**

This is the correct answer. In Python, metaclasses allow you to customize class creation by modifying or extending the class definition before it's finalized. In this case, the `AddMethodMeta` metaclass dynamically adds a method named `add_method` to any class it's applied to. When we create an instance of `MyClass`, it gains access to this new method, which simply returns its argument incremented by 5.

The line `print(obj.add_method(10))` will therefore output `15`."

Which of the following statements is true about this code? Select all correct answers:

A) The metaclass `Meta` checks if the subclass has a `greet` method before allowing it to be instantiated.
B) The `greeting_decorator` modifies the `greet` method of any class it decorates, adding a greeting message at the beginning.
C) When `person.greet()` is called, it will first print ""Hello from Person"" and then ""I am a person"".
D) Both A and B are correct.";"[ANSWER] D

Explanation:
A) The metaclass `Meta` correctly checks if the subclass has a `greet` method. If not, it raises a `TypeError`, which is true.
B) The `greeting_decorator` correctly modifies the `greet` method by adding a greeting message at the beginning, which is also true.

What is the expected output of this code? Why does it behave that way?

A) The output will be 1000 because all increments are performed atomically.

B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

C) The output will be more than 1000 due to extra increments caused by thread switching.

D) The program will raise an exception due to improper use of the lock.";"B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

Explanation:
- The decorator `@thread_safe` is intended to ensure that the `increment` method of `SharedResource` is thread-safe by using a lock.
- However, the lock object is created inside the wrapper function for each call. This means that each `increment` call will use its own separate lock instead of sharing the same one across threads.
- Since each thread uses its own lock and does not block other threads from reading and writing to `value`, race conditions can still occur.
- Therefore, the final value of `resource.value` will be less than 1000, as multiple increments might be incorrectly applied."

You are tasked with creating a Python application that needs to track the creation of all instances of a certain class. You decide to use a metaclass for this purpose. Here is a partially complete code snippet:

```python

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(InstanceTracker._instances)  # Expected output: {'MyClass': [obj1, obj2]}

Which line of code should be added to the `__new__` method in the `InstanceTracker` metaclass to track the creation of instances?

A) `cls._instances[name].append(instance)`
B) `self._instances[name] = []`
C) `self._instances[name].append(self())`
D) `self._instances[name].append(new_class())`";"[ANSWER] C

Explanation:
In the provided code, we need to track the creation of instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass. The current implementation does not add any logic to track instances. 

Option A is incorrect because `instance` is not defined in the scope where this line would be executed.
Option B is incorrect because it attempts to create a new list for each class but does not append any instances to it.
Option C is correct because it appends an instance of the newly created class to a list associated with the class name. The `self()` call inside `append` creates a new instance of the class, which is then added to the list stored in `_instances`.
Option D is incorrect because it tries to append the metaclass itself rather than an instance of the class.

Adding this line to the `__new__` method will correctly track and store instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass."

B) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. After that, the program will print nothing as the timer is not running any more tasks.

C) The coroutine starts and stays alive indefinitely because the timer keeps scheduling itself to run every 3 seconds.

D) There will be an error because adding a task to the `AsyncTimer` instance does not start it immediately.";"A) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. The timer runs in an infinite loop every 3 seconds, but since there's only one task, it doesn't add any complexity.

The `run` method of the `AsyncTimer` class is designed to run indefinitely, continuously waiting for all tasks to complete before sleeping for the specified interval. Since the `my_coroutine` is added with a sleep duration of 2 seconds, it will complete after 2 seconds and then wait again for the next iteration of the timer loop (every 3 seconds).

The correct answer is D. The metaclass `Meta` dynamically adds a new attribute to each integer attribute in the class, but it only affects attributes named with a single letter ('x', 'z'). This is because when the `Meta` metaclass iterates over all attributes, it includes inherited attributes as well. In this case, since 'y' is not an integer, no additional attribute is added for it. The '__new__' method of the metaclass is included in the class dictionary because metaclasses define their own `__new__` method to create and return a new class object."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) When `MyClass` is defined, it does not raise any errors.
B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.
C) The metaclass `Meta` can be used to enforce that all classes inheriting from `MyClass` must also define an attribute `x`.
D) The metaclass `Meta` cannot be instantiated directly.";"B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because the code does not run without errors. It raises a `TypeError` during class creation.
- Option C is incorrect because metaclasses like `Meta` control the creation of classes, not their inheritance.
- Option D is correct because a metaclass itself is just a class that inherits from `type`, and it can be instantiated as any other class.
- Option B is correct. The metaclass `Meta` checks if the attribute `x` is present in the class dictionary when the class is being created. If it's not, it raises a `TypeError`."

You are tasked with creating a context manager that logs the time taken for each block of code it decorates. However, you want this logging to be performed asynchronously, so that it does not block the main execution flow. Your task is to design such a context manager using Python's `asyncio` library.

Here's a partially implemented version of your context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f""Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds"")

# Example usage:
async def main():
    async with AsyncTimerContextManager() as timer:
        # Simulate some asynchronous work
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print(""Work completed!"")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

However, this code has an issue: it does not correctly handle exceptions that might occur within the `with` block. You need to ensure that any exceptions raised inside the `with` block are propagated and handled by the caller of `async with`.

What change should you make to the `AsyncTimerContextManager` class to correctly propagate exceptions?

A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

B) Wrap the code that calculates and logs the duration in a try-except block.

C) Remove the `return self` statement from the `__aenter__` method.

D) Change the `log_time_taken` method to be an instance method instead of a static method.";"A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

The correct answer is A. In the `__aexit__` method, you should add a condition to check if an exception occurred (`if exc_type`). If an exception did occur, you should re-raise it using `raise exc_val from exc_tb`. This ensures that any exceptions raised within the `with` block are propagated and handled correctly by the caller of `async with`.

Here's the corrected version of the context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        if exc_type is None:
            await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)
        else:
            raise exc_val from exc_tb

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f""Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds"")

# Example usage remains the same
```

This implementation ensures that exceptions are correctly propagated, allowing for proper error handling in the code using the context manager."

A) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", followed by ""Task 2 started"", then ""Task 1 finished"", and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

B) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 1 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

C) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", followed by ""Task 2 started"", and both tasks will finish concurrently without waiting for the other.

D) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 2 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, but ""Task 1 finished"" will not print because it takes longer to complete.";"B) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 1 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

Explanation: 
- The `asyncio.gather` function runs multiple coroutines concurrently.
- When both tasks start, they print their start messages immediately.
- However, since `task2` completes first (after 1 second), its completion is printed next.
- After a total of 2 seconds, the completion of `task1` is printed."

A) True  
B) False  
C) The code will raise an error  
D) None of the above";"**Answer:** A) True

**Explanation:**  
The provided metaclass, `SingletonMeta`, ensures that only one instance of any class using it can be created. In this case, when `db1` and `db2` are instantiated from the `Database` class, the `__call__` method of the metaclass is invoked. Since `_instances[cls]` is checked for `SingletonMeta`, and since no other instance exists in `_instances`, both `db1` and `db2` will reference the same instance stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`."

Which of the following statements is true about the `counter` decorator and the `my_function` when it's decorated?

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

B) The `wrapper` function does not have access to the `count` attribute because it is a local variable in the `counter` function.

C) Each call to `my_function` creates a new instance of the `counter` decorator.

D) When `my_function` is decorated, the `func.count` attribute is set to 1 immediately and then incremented by 1 each time the function is called.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

Explanation:
- A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it. In this case, the `counter` decorator is designed to keep track of how many times the decorated function (`my_function`) has been called.
- The `wrapper` function inside the `counter` decorator has access to all non-local variables, including those defined in enclosing functions. Therefore, it can modify the `count` attribute which was set on the original function object when it was passed to the decorator.
- Each call to `my_function()` increments the `count` by 1, demonstrating that the `func.count` attribute is indeed being updated correctly with each invocation.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

B) The use of `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` inside the wrapper function is incorrect and will raise an error.

C) The `@time_decorator` syntax applies the decorator to any synchronous or asynchronous function without modification.

D) The execution time measurement is accurate but can be improved by using a more precise timer.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

Explanation: The code uses `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` to get the current time asynchronously, which is appropriate for measuring the execution time of an asyncio function. This method ensures that the timing does not interfere with other tasks running in the event loop. The decorator works as intended and provides accurate execution time measurements for asynchronous functions."

What is the output when running this code?

A) The file 'example.txt' will be created with ""Hello, World!"" inside.
B) ""Executing open_file"" will be printed before the file is written to.
C) An error will occur because decorators cannot be used with context managers.
D) ""Executing open_file"" will not be printed.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The file 'example.txt' will be created with ""Hello, World!"" inside.

Explanation: Decorators and context managers are separate concepts in Python. While you can use a decorator on any callable, including a function used within a context manager, the decorators themselves do not interfere with the behavior of the context manager. In this example, `log_decorator` is applied to `open_file`, but since it does not modify the behavior of opening or closing the file (only logs that the function is being executed), the file operations will still occur as expected.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) The `my_decorator` will only execute before the `say_hello()` function, not when accessing the `my_property`.

Explanation:
In Python, decorators can be applied to methods in classes. However, when a property is accessed, it does not pass through the decorator because properties have their own getter, setter, and deleter methods associated with them. In this case, the `@property` decorator applies the `my_decorator` only to the getter method of `my_property`. Therefore, the message ""Something is happening before the function is called."" will be printed when accessing `obj.my_property`, but ""Something is happening after the function is called."" will not be printed because the decorator does not apply to the setter or deleter methods."

B) The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator wraps `my_async_function` in a way that it can be used with `asyncio.run()`.

**Explanation:**
The `@AsyncDecorator` class is designed to accept an asynchronous function (`my_async_function`) and simply call it. This does not change the fact that `my_async_function` is still an async function, meaning it requires proper execution through an event loop like `asyncio.run()`. Thus, using `@AsyncDecorator` does not alter the fundamental nature of `my_async_function`; it remains a coroutine, which can only be executed in an asyncio context. Therefore, calling `my_async_function()` directly outside of an async context or without wrapping it in an appropriate event loop will raise an error unless `my_async_function` is defined as a regular function rather than an async one."

You are tasked with optimizing a Python script that involves frequent I/O operations. The current implementation uses synchronous file handling, which is blocking and affects the performance of the application.

To optimize this, you decide to use asynchronous file handling with `asyncio`. However, your script also needs to maintain state across multiple asynchronous tasks without using global variables or mutable shared data structures.

Which of the following approaches would be most suitable for maintaining state between asynchronous tasks while optimizing I/O operations?

A) Using a class-based state management system that inherits from `asyncio.Lock` and handles all state transitions asynchronously

B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup

C) Implementing a custom metaclass that tracks state across asynchronous tasks by intercepting attribute access and modification

D) Creating a global dictionary to store state information, which is thread-safe due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup**

This approach is the most suitable for several reasons:
1. **State Management**: `AsyncExitStack` allows you to manage multiple asynchronous context managers efficiently, ensuring that resources are cleaned up properly even if an exception occurs.
2. **Concurrency Safety**: By using `asyncio.Queue`, you can safely share state across tasks without worrying about race conditions or synchronization issues, making the system more robust and scalable.
3. **Asynchronous Operations**: Since both `AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` are asynchronous constructs, they integrate seamlessly with other asynchronous components of your application, improving overall performance and responsiveness.

The other options have limitations:
- **Option A** uses `asyncio.Lock`, which is more for synchronization rather than state management.
- **Option C**, while it might be interesting, introduces unnecessary complexity and potential issues related to maintaining state in a metaclass, especially since metaclasses are not directly designed for this purpose.
- **Option D** relies on the GIL, which would limit performance gains from asynchronous programming, as it doesn't take advantage of multiple cores or threads effectively."

Which of the following is the correct diagnosis for why `MyClass` instances do not log method calls as expected?

A) The metaclass's `__new__` method is incorrectly overriding the class dictionary.

B) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.

C) Using `setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))` modifies the class dictionary in an unintended way.

D) The `wrapper` function inside `log_method` is incorrectly capturing its arguments.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.

The issue with the provided code is that the `log_method` static method is intended to return a new callable that logs when the wrapped method is called. However, it incorrectly modifies the `wrapper` function's closure by using `*args, **kwargs`, which prevents it from capturing the correct arguments and keyword arguments of the original method.

To fix this, one should avoid modifying the `wrapper` function in-place within `log_method`. A better approach would be to define a new callable object that captures the original method and its signature correctly. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f""Creating class {name}"")
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():

                setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

A) The `__len__` method will return 0 because it does not count attributes.

B) The `__len__` method will raise an error because it cannot determine attribute counts dynamically.

C) The `__len__` method will return 2 because it correctly counts the instance attributes.

D) The behavior of the `MyClass` instances will be unchanged as no additional methods were added.

### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct answer: C) The `__len__` method will return 2 because it correctly counts the instance attributes.**

**Explanation:** The metaclass `AutoLenMeta` dynamically adds a `__len__` method to any class it decorates. This method returns the number of items in the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which typically includes all non-private attributes of the class (i.e., those not starting with an underscore). Therefore, when `MyClass` is created, the `__len__` method will return 2, as there are two attributes (`a` and `b`) in the `MyClass`. The lambda function used for `__len__` counts all items directly from the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which correctly reflects the number of instance attributes.";"Answer format error.

B) Method '__init__' called with args: (), kwargs: {}  
   38

C) Method '__init__' called with args: (10, 20), kwargs: {}  
   Method 'add' called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}

D) Error: __new__() got multiple values for argument 'name'

**Part 2 (Answer):**
C) Method '__init__' called with args: (10, 20), kwargs: {}  
   Method 'add' called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}  
   40

**Explanation:** 
When `MyClass` is instantiated, the metaclass `LogMethodCalls` logs the call to the `__init__` method before executing it. After `__init__` is called, when `obj.add(5, 3)` is executed, the `add` method is also logged by the `LogMethodCalls` metaclass. The expected output includes both the log statements and the result of the `add` method call, which is 40."

print(instance1 == instance2)  # Output: ?
print(instance1.value)       # Output: ?

What will be the output of `instance1 == instance2` and `instance1.value` when the code is executed?

A. True, 10  
B. False, 10  
C. True, 20  
D. False, 20";"A. True, 10  

Explanation: The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created, no matter how many times it is instantiated. When `instance1 = create_instance(10)` is executed, an instance with `value=10` is created and stored in `_instances`. Then, when `instance2 = create_instance(20)` is called, the existing instance from `_instances` (which has `value=10`) is returned. Therefore, `instance1 == instance2` evaluates to True because they refer to the same object. Additionally, since both instances are the same, `instance1.value` also returns 10."

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to modify the behavior of a class method:

```python
from functools import wraps

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):

# Create an instance of MyClass and call its method
obj = MyClass(10)

What will be the output of this code when executed? Explain how decorators work in this context.

A) ""Calling get_value with args=(), kwargs={}

""10""

C) TypeError: get_value() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'

D) None";"A) ""Calling get_value with args=(), kwargs={}

Explanation: In this example, a decorator named `log_method_calls` is defined to log the calls to methods it decorates. The `wrapper` function inside the decorator logs the method name and its arguments before calling the original method. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and the `get_value` method is called, the output shows that the method was successfully logged with no arguments passed (as `self` is automatically passed by Python when a method is called on an instance), followed by the return value of the method call."

C) The tasks run concurrently, and all three finish within about 3 seconds.

Explanation:
The `asyncio.gather` function is used to run multiple coroutines concurrently. In this example, 'A', 'B', and 'C' start at the same time, and each task has a different sleep duration. Task 'A' sleeps for 1 second, 'B' for 2 seconds, and 'C' for 3 seconds.

Implement a decorator that measures the execution time of a coroutine. The decorator should be able to handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions. Use `asyncio` for asynchronous timing.

Here is a partial implementation to help you get started:

    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()

sync_function = measure_time(lambda: time.sleep(1))

# Call both the synchronous and asynchronous functions to see their execution times.
sync_function()
asyncio.run(async_function())

Which of the following statements is true regarding the implementation above?

A) The `measure_time` decorator works correctly for both synchronous and asynchronous functions but it fails when applied to synchronous functions.

B) The `measure_time` decorator is fully functional for both types of functions and will accurately measure their execution times.

C) The `wrapper` function in the decorator incorrectly measures time due to a mistake in capturing start and end times.

D) The `async_function` can be called directly without using `await`, but it will not trigger the execution time measurement because of its `@measure_time` decorator.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
B) The `measure_time` decorator is fully functional for both types of functions and will accurately measure their execution times.

The implementation uses `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` to capture the current loop time, which works correctly whether the function being measured is synchronous or asynchronous. For synchronous functions, calling `await asyncio.sleep(1)` in a coroutine context effectively pauses the event loop for 1 second while still allowing other tasks to run, thus accurately measuring the execution time.";"Answer format error.

D) The use of `@wraps(cls)` in the decorator is unnecessary and causing issues.

Part 2 (Answer):
B) Both the metaclass and the decorator are incorrectly trying to manage instances.

Explanation:
The issue with the provided code lies in its attempt to combine singleton patterns using both a metaclass (`SingletonMeta`) and a decorator (`singleton`). Each of these methods tries to manage the instance creation, leading to conflicts when an instance is created through one method (metaclass) and later attempted again through another (decorator). The correct approach would be to use either the metaclass or the decorator but not both. If using a metaclass, it should handle all instance creation logic within its `__call__` method. If using a decorator, it should manage instances outside of class definitions and apply it to methods that need to return singleton instances rather than applying it directly to the class.";"Answer format error.

A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.

B) The decorator uses a closure to capture and modify the behavior of the original function.

C) The `wrapper` function inside the `timer` decorator directly replaces `compute_sum`.

D) The execution time is printed only once, outside of the function call in `compute_sum`.";"A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.

**Explanation:** 
Option A is correct. In Python, decorators are functions that take another function and extend its behavior without explicitly modifying it. The `wrapper` function captures the execution time by recording the start and end times around the call to the original function `func`. This extended behavior is then returned when `compute_sum` is called.

**Option B:**
While the decorator does use a closure, this is not what makes it modify the original function. A closure only affects how variables are bound within nested functions. The modification happens through the way the `wrapper` function is defined and returned by the `timer` decorator.

**Option C:**
This statement is incorrect because the `wrapper` function does not replace `compute_sum`. Instead, it wraps around `compute_sum` to add the timing functionality.

**Option D:**
The execution time is printed inside the `wrapper` function each time `compute_sum` is called. It is not a one-time print outside of the function call."

Explanation: The correct answer is B. The metaclass `AutoReprMeta` dynamically adds a `__repr__` method to any class it decorates, which in this case is `MyClass`. This method returns a string formatted as ""ClassName(instance_id)"", where `instance_id` is the memory address of the instance, as returned by Python's built-in `id()` function.

D) The decorator will cause a stack overflow due to excessive recursion when used with large inputs.

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]  
**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When applied to `compute_sum`, the decorator will print the execution time without modifying its return value.

Explanation: The provided decorator, `timing_decorator`, is correctly implemented. It measures the time taken by the function it decorates (`func`) and prints this duration. However, it does not modify the return value of the function being decorated. Therefore, when `compute_sum(100000)` is called with the `@timing_decorator` applied, it will print the execution time and then return the result of `sum(range(1))`, which is 5000050000, as expected.

The decorator can be used with coroutine functions without issues. However, in Python, decorators are not directly applicable to coroutines due to differences in how they are executed and awaited, so attempting to use a timing decorator on a coroutine would not raise an error but would likely not function as intended.

**Explanation:**  
The decorator `async_if_docstring_contains_async` checks if the docstring of a function contains the word ""async"". If it does, the function is decorated with `asyncio.coroutine`, which converts it into an asynchronous function. In the given code, the subclass `Derived` inherits from `Base`. Since `method_with_async_in_docstring` has a docstring containing ""async"", it will be converted to an asynchronous method when it is accessed via an instance of `Derived`. On the other hand, `method_without_async_in_docstring`, even though it's defined as an async method in the class definition, does not have the required word ""async"" in its docstring.

# What will be the result of calling `create_instance()`?
A) True
B) False
C) TypeError
D) SyntaxError";"A) True

Explanation: 
The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can ever be created. When you call `create_instance()`, it attempts to create two instances of `MyClass`. Due to the singleton pattern enforced by the metaclass, both `obj1` and `obj2` will refer to the same object in memory, making the comparison `obj1 is obj2` evaluate to `True`."

A) ""Class MyClass is being created"" will be printed, and then a TypeError will occur because `MyClass` cannot be used as a context manager.
B) ""Class MyClass is being created"" will be printed, and then an instance of `MyClass` will be created without any errors.
C) A NameError will occur because the `with` statement requires an object that implements the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
D) The code will not run as there is a syntax error in defining the `Meta` metaclass.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A) ""Class MyClass is being created"" will be printed, and then a TypeError will occur because `MyClass` cannot be used as a context manager.

Explanation: The `with` statement requires that the object passed to it implements the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. Since `Meta` does not define these methods, attempting to use `MyClass` with a `with` statement results in a TypeError even though the metaclass logs the creation of the class as intended."

A) The `Timer` class will always print a timing that is exactly the same as what `timed_function` prints.

B) Both `timed_function` and `Timer` are decorators, but they can be used interchangeably.

C) The `Timer` context manager will provide more precise timing than the `timed_function`.

D) The `timed_function` decorator is applied to the function inside the `with Timer()` block.

### Part 2 (Answer)
**";"C) The `Timer` context manager will provide more precise timing than the `timed_function`.**

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Option A:** Incorrect. While both decorators and context managers can be used for timing, the `Timer` class provides more precision due to its use of the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, which are called at the exact start and end of the block respectively.
  
- **Option B:** Correct. Both `timed_function` and `Timer` can be used as decorators, but they serve different purposes. The decorator is useful for adding functionality to existing functions without changing their interface, while the context manager provides a way to manage resources (like file handles or timers) in a more controlled manner.
  
- **Option C:** Correct. The `Timer` class offers more precision because it measures the time between the exact entry and exit of the block where it is used. This eliminates any overhead that might be incurred by function calls, providing a more accurate timing.

- **Option D:** Incorrect. The `timed_function` decorator is applied to the `long_running_task` function before entering the context manager block with `Timer()`. Thus, the decorator's timing will include the time spent both inside and outside the `with Timer()` block."

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `log_decorator` will not be applied to any methods.

B) The `enter` and `exit` methods will be logged before and after their execution.

C) The `ContextManager` class must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods for the context manager to work correctly.

D) There will be a runtime error because `Meta` does not properly delegate the implementation of `__enter__` and `__exit__`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The `ContextManager` class must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods for the context manager to work correctly.

The correct answer is C. Here's why:

- In the provided code, the `Meta` metaclass checks if `enter` and `exit` methods are defined in any subclass of `ContextManager`. If they are, it replaces them with decorated versions using `log_decorator`.
- For a class to be usable as a context manager, it must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. The `Meta` metaclass ensures that these methods are present before replacing them with the decorated versions.
- If the subclass does not define either method, they will remain unmodified, but the context manager will still be valid as long as other necessary methods (like `__init__`) are implemented.

Options A, B, and D are incorrect:
- A is wrong because `log_decorator` is applied to both the original `enter` and `exit` methods.
- B is not entirely correct because the decorator only logs the method calls if they exist in the subclass. If either `enter` or `exit` is missing, it won't be logged.
- D is incorrect because there is no issue with how `Meta` handles the methods; it correctly checks and decorates them if present."
"2025-05-12 00:02";"";"**Part 1 (Question):**
Implement a metaclass that allows only one instance of any class it decorates. This metaclass should also ensure that attempting to create another instance results in raising an exception with the message ""Only one instance allowed"". Use this metaclass on a simple class `Singleton`.

```python
# Your code here

class Singleton:
    pass

# Example usage:
instance1 = Singleton()
print(instance1)  # Should print the singleton instance

try:
    instance2 = Singleton()  # This should raise an exception

        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Example usage remains the same
```

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The correct implementation is option B. This metaclass uses a class variable `_instance` to store the instance of the class when it is first created. Any subsequent attempts to create an instance will return this stored instance, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists.

Option A and D are essentially the same, storing all instances in a dictionary `_instances`, which could lead to issues if multiple different classes use this metaclass. Option C incorrectly tries to modify the class definition during creation using `__new__`, which is not necessary for this functionality."

What does the code do when executed? What are the expected outputs?

A) The program creates two instances of `MyClass`, each with a delay of 1 and 2 seconds respectively. It then prints the values and counts.

B) The program creates one instance of `MyClass` and prints its value twice, followed by the count of instances.

C) An error occurs because async methods cannot be added to classes using metaclasses.

D) The program crashes due to a misuse of asyncio.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

A) The program creates two instances of `MyClass`, each with a delay of 1 and 2 seconds respectively. It then prints the values and counts.

**Explanation:** 
The metaclass `Meta` is used to add an instance counter to the class, which increments every time a new instance of `MyClass` is created. The async method `async_method` is dynamically added to `MyClass` using the `__get__` method of the coroutine function to bind it correctly to the class methods. When run, the program creates two instances of `MyClass`, and each prints its value after a delay followed by the total count of instances created."

Which of the following statements correctly describes how and why this metaclass works?

A) The metaclass dynamically defines a new method `hello_world` during class creation.

B) The `__new__` method is overridden to manually add the method to each instance.

C) The metaclass uses a decorator to modify the class after it's created.

D) The `hello_world` method is added to instances of `MyClass`, not to the class itself.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The metaclass dynamically defines a new method `hello_world` during class creation.

Explanation: In Python, metaclasses are essentially classes that create other classes. When a class is defined using a metaclass, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called with the class name, base classes, and class dictionary as arguments. Inside this method, we can modify or extend the class dictionary to include additional methods, attributes, or even dynamically define new methods. In this case, the `Meta` metaclass adds a lambda function named `hello_world` that prints ""Hello, World!"" whenever it is called.

The other options are incorrect:
- B) The method is added directly to the class itself through the metaclass.
- C) This refers to decorators, which modify functions or methods after they are defined, not during class creation.
- D) The method is added to the class, not instances of the class."

You are tasked with creating a decorator that can be used to measure the execution time of any function it decorates. The decorator should handle asynchronous functions as well as synchronous ones. However, you've encountered an issue: when applying the decorator to an async function, it doesn't work correctly due to the way decorators are typically applied.

Here's a code snippet that attempts to create such a decorator:

```python
import time

def measure_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

The code does not work as expected for an async function. Modify the `measure_time` decorator so that it can handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly.

A) Provide a solution that works for both types of functions.
B) Explain why the original implementation fails for async functions.
C) Suggest a way to modify the decorator to accommodate both cases without significantly altering its structure.";"[A] The modified `measure_time` decorator should use Python's `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` to check if the decorated function is an async function. If it is, the decorator should measure time differently by using `await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(None, func)` inside a coroutine.

[B] The original implementation fails for async functions because it calls the function directly without awaiting it when it's an async function. This leads to the measurement starting before the function actually starts running and ending before it finishes, resulting in incorrect timing.

[C] To accommodate both synchronous and asynchronous functions, the decorator can be modified to check if the wrapped function is an async function using `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)`. If it is, the decorator should measure time by awaiting the function inside a coroutine. Otherwise, it should proceed as before:

```python
import asyncio
import time

def measure_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func):

You are tasked with creating a decorator that measures the execution time of a function, but this time you want to ensure that it is only applied to functions within specific classes. To achieve this, you decide to use both decorators and metaclasses.

Here's your starting point:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimeMeasuringMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith(""__""):
                dct[attr_name] = timing_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class TimeMeasuringClass(metaclass=TimeMeasuringMeta):
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(1.0)

# Example usage:
tm = TimeMeasuringClass()
tm.method1()  # Should print execution time
tm.method2()  # Should print execution time
```

You want to ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods of classes defined with `TimeMeasuringMeta`. However, you also notice that applying decorators directly to method definitions within a class might not be as clean or flexible as using metaclasses. Your task is to modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass so that it applies the `timing_decorator` only to methods where the decorator is explicitly specified.

**Question:** How can you modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass to ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods where it is explicitly specified, such as by using a custom attribute or annotation?

A) By checking for a specific attribute or annotation on each method during the metaclass's `__new__` method
B) By dynamically adding the decorator to methods at runtime within the class definition
C) By overriding the `__getattribute__` method of the metaclass to apply the decorator conditionally
D) By using a custom decorator that checks for its application within the metaclass";"[ANSWER]
A) By checking for a specific attribute or annotation on each method during the metaclass's `__new__` method

Explanation:
To ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods where it is explicitly specified, you can modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass by adding logic in its `__new__` method to check for a specific attribute or annotation on each method. If this attribute or annotation is present, apply the decorator; otherwise, leave the method unchanged. This approach allows for fine-grained control over which methods are decorated and can be easily extended to accommodate different ways of specifying that a method should be timed."

You are tasked with creating a Python decorator that can be applied to both functions and class methods. The decorator should log the function call details including the arguments passed, but it should handle both regular functions and static/class methods correctly. Implement this decorator and demonstrate its usage on a sample function and a class method.

```python
# Decorator implementation

    return a + b

# Example usage of the decorator on a class method

    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y

# Test cases
result_add = add(3, 4)
print(result_add)  # Output should be 7 with logged call details

calc = Calculator()
result_multiply = calc.multiply(5, 6)
print(result_multiply)  # Output should be 30 with logged call details
```

### Part 2 (Answer)
**";"A**

**Detailed Explanation:** 
The correct answer involves creating a decorator that can handle both regular functions and static/class methods. This requires using the `functools.wraps` to preserve the original function's metadata and checking if the wrapped method is an instance method, class method, or static method.

Here is a possible implementation of the `log_calls` decorator:

```python
import functools

def log_calls(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if inspect.ismethod(wrapper) and not isinstance(wrapper, staticmethod):
            instance = args[0]
            method_name = func.__name__
            args = args[1:]
        else:
            instance = None
            method_name = func.__qualname__
        
        print(f""Calling {method_name} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f""{method_name} returned {result}"")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Example usage of the decorator on a function
@log_calls
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example usage of the decorator on a class method
class Calculator:
    @staticmethod
    @log_calls
    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y

# Test cases
result_add = add(3, 4)
print(result_add)  # Output should be 7 with logged call details

calc = Calculator()
result_multiply = calc.multiply(5, 6)
print(result_multiply)  # Output should be 30 with logged call details
```

This implementation uses `inspect.ismethod` to differentiate between instance methods and static/class methods. For instance methods, it adjusts the arguments list by removing the first argument which is the instance itself.

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import threading

def thread_safe(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with threading.Lock():
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1

    def get_value(self):
        return self.value

def main():
    counter = Counter()
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=counter.increment) for _ in range(100)]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

    print(counter.get_value())

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and implications of this code?

A) The `Counter` class is thread-safe without using any decorators or locks.
B) The `thread_safe` decorator ensures that the `increment` method can be safely called from multiple threads, but it does not protect other methods like `get_value`.
C) The use of threading in this code guarantees that the counter will always display a value of 100.
D) The `Counter` class will raise an exception due to concurrent access issues.

### Part 2 (Answer)
B) The `thread_safe` decorator ensures that the `increment` method can be safely called from multiple threads, but it does not protect other methods like `get_value`.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- The `thread_safe` decorator is applied to the `Counter` class to ensure thread safety. It wraps each method in a lock context manager, which means that only one thread can execute any of the wrapped methods at a time.
  
- However, this protection does not extend to other methods like `get_value`. If another method were to access or modify the state without using the lock, it could lead to race conditions even though `increment` is protected.

- In the given code, each thread calls `increment`, which is protected by the lock. Since no other threads can call `increment` at the same time, there will be no data corruption for incrementing the counter. However, calling `get_value` from multiple threads simultaneously could lead to race conditions unless additional synchronization measures are taken.

- Therefore, option B accurately describes that while the `thread_safe` decorator makes `increment` thread-safe, it does not cover all methods in the `Counter` class.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a singleton pattern using metaclasses:

        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

# Example usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Should print True
print(obj1.value)
```

Which of the following statements about this code is incorrect?

A. The `SingletonMeta` metaclass correctly implements the singleton pattern.
B. Instances of `MyClass` are created only once, ensuring that `obj1` and `obj2` refer to the same object.
C. The `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` checks if an instance already exists before creating a new one.
D. The `value` attribute is correctly set for both `obj1` and `obj2`.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A. The statement ""The `SingletonMeta` metaclass correctly implements the singleton pattern"" is incorrect.

Explanation: While `SingletonMeta` does ensure that only one instance of `MyClass` is created, it uses a class-level dictionary `_instances` to store instances. This approach might not be thread-safe in a multi-threaded environment where multiple threads could potentially create instances simultaneously before any have been added to the dictionary. A more robust solution would involve using threading locks or atomic operations to ensure thread safety when checking and setting `_instances`."

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The decorator `log_resource_access` ensures that the `access_database` function can only be called once.

B) When `access_database` is decorated with `@log_resource_access`, it logs entering and exiting the function, and then executes the actual database access logic.

C) The decorator `log_resource_access` will cause a syntax error when applied to any function.

D) Calling `access_database()` will not output any messages because the decorator does nothing.";"### Answer:
B) When `access_database` is decorated with `@log_resource_access`, it logs entering and exiting the function, and then executes the actual database access logic.

**Explanation:**
- The decorator `log_resource_access` wraps the original `access_database` function to add logging functionality before and after its execution.
- Inside the `wrapper` function, the message ""Entering {func.__name__}"" is printed when entering the function, followed by the execution of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, which performs the actual database access. Afterward, the message ""Exiting {func.__name__}"" is printed to indicate that the function has exited.
- This allows for monitoring and debugging purposes without modifying the original function logic."

C) The `Timer` class accurately measures the time taken by both synchronous and asynchronous operations within its `async with` block.
D) The `Timer` class is not thread-safe.";"[ANSWER] C) The `Timer` class accurately measures the time taken by both synchronous and asynchronous operations within its `async with` block.

**Explanation:**
- The `Timer` class uses Python's `asyncio.sleep()` in its `main()` function, which is an asynchronous operation. 
- The `Timer` class defines both `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods, making it a context manager that works with the `async with` statement.
- When using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`, Python's event loop is not blocked, allowing other tasks to run concurrently. This demonstrates that the `Timer` class can accurately measure both synchronous (like time.sleep) and asynchronous operations.
- The example correctly shows how to use an asynchronous context manager (`async with`) with a function that involves asynchronous sleep, making option C the correct answer."

A) The `log_arguments` decorator correctly logs both positional and keyword arguments for any method it decorates.

B) When `add(2, 3)` is called on an instance of `Calculator`, it will print ""Arguments: (2, 3), Keyword Arguments: {}"" before returning the result of the addition.

C) The `wrapper` function in the decorator replaces the original method's signature, leading to potential issues when the method's signature needs to be preserved.

D) The `log_arguments` decorator can be used on any method that does not require access to the instance (`self`) or class (`cls`) of the object it is called on.";"B) When `add(2, 3)` is called on an instance of `Calculator`, it will print ""Arguments: (2, 3), Keyword Arguments: {}"" before returning the result of the addition.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because while the decorator correctly logs positional arguments, it does not log keyword arguments when they are provided.
- Option C is partially correct but misleading. The `wrapper` function does not replace the original method's signature; instead, it simply adds logging functionality around the method call without altering its interface.
- Option D is incorrect because if a method is decorated with `log_arguments`, it will receive an additional positional argument (`self`) when called as a class method, which might cause errors or unexpected behavior unless explicitly handled in the decorator."

B) All `fetch_data` calls are made sequentially, waiting for each to complete before starting the next.
C) The use of `asyncio.gather` allows all `fetch_data` calls to run concurrently, significantly speeding up the fetching process.
D) There is no error handling mechanism in place if a URL fails to fetch data.";"[ANSWER]
C) The use of `asyncio.gather` allows all `fetch_data` calls to run concurrently, significantly speeding up the fetching process.

Explanation:
- **Option A and B** are incorrect because the code uses `asyncio.gather`, which runs all tasks concurrently. Each task (each call to `fetch_data`) is scheduled and started immediately after the previous one, but they don't wait for each other. Therefore, multiple URLs' data can be fetched at the same time.
- **Option C** is correct as `asyncio.gather` takes an iterable of coroutines (`tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in self.urls]`) and schedules them to run concurrently. This results in all `fetch_data` calls starting almost immediately and finishing in parallel, which can significantly reduce the total time needed to fetch data from multiple URLs.
- **Option D** is not addressed in the provided code. While it's generally a good practice to include error handling when dealing with network requests or external services, this specific question does not touch upon that aspect of the code."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `WebServer` class can be instantiated and its methods called directly without any issues.

B) Calling `asyncio.run(web_server.start())` will cause a runtime error because `web_server.start()` is an async method and should not be awaited directly inside `run_server`.

C) The server listens on the specified host and port, handles client connections asynchronously, and echoes back the received data in uppercase.

D) None of the above";"C) The server listens on the specified host and port, handles client connections asynchronously, and echoes back the received data in uppercase.

Explanation:
- The `WebServer` class is properly defined with an asynchronous method `handle_request` to handle incoming client requests.
- The `start` method sets up and starts the asyncio server, which correctly awaits the `serve_forever()` call.
- When `asyncio.run(web_server.start())` is called in `run_server`, it executes the async function as expected, without awaiting it directly inside another async function or coroutine. This is valid because `asyncio.run()` takes care of running the main entry point for asyncio programs.

B) The `get_data()` function will run synchronously and block the event loop.

C) The `@FetchDecorator` measures the time taken by `fetch_data()` and prints it out.

D) The `@FetchDecorator` is designed to work with synchronous functions only.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**C) The @FetchDecorator measures the time taken by fetch_data() and prints it out.**

Explanation:

The provided code defines a coroutine `get_data()` that uses another coroutine `fetch_data()`. The decorator `FetchDecorator` is applied to `get_data()`, which adds timing functionality around its execution.

When `get_data()` is called, it wraps the call to `fetch_data()` with timing logic. Inside the `__call__` method of the decorator, the start time is recorded before calling the decorated function (`self.func`). After the function returns, the end time is recorded, and the difference (time taken) is printed out.

This allows you to measure and print how long it takes for `fetch_data()` to execute, which demonstrates that the decorator works correctly with asynchronous functions."

B) The `attribute` starts at 1 and is incremented every time `increment()` is called.

C) The `attribute` is incremented correctly on the first call to `increment()`, but subsequent calls have no effect.

D) The code does not compile because it attempts to modify a class attribute inside a metaclass method.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `attribute` is incremented every time `increment()` is called, but it will always start from 0 for each new instance.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` sets the default value of `attribute` to 0 when the class is initialized.
- The decorator `modify_attribute` increments the `attribute` by 1 each time the decorated method `increment()` is called.
- Since `attribute` is a class attribute, it is shared among all instances of the class. However, in this specific code structure, it behaves as if it were incremented only once per instance because the increment happens every time an instance calls its own `increment()` method, not the original implementation in the metaclass."

D) There is no issue with the current implementation; it correctly measures the execution time of async functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The `wrapper` function does not properly handle exceptions raised by the decorated async function.

Explanation:
In the provided code, if an exception occurs within the `my_async_function`, it will not be caught and propagated. To fix this, the `wrapper` function should be modified to catch exceptions and re-raise them after printing the execution time. Here's how you can correct it:

try:
    loop.run_until_complete(my_async_function())
except Exception as e:

Imagine you are developing a library that needs to manage resources efficiently. You decide to create a context manager that automatically handles the opening and closing of files, but also ensures that each file is only opened once even if multiple parts of your code attempt to open it simultaneously.

Here's an example implementation using a context manager:

```python
class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
        self.file = None

    async def open(self):
        if not self.file:

    async def read(self):
        if self.file:
            return await self.file.read()
        else:
            raise IOError(""File is not opened"")

    async def close(self):
        if self.file:
            await self.file.close()
            self.file = None

async def manage_file(filename):

    finally:
        await manager.close()
```

However, you notice that this approach is not thread-safe because multiple threads could potentially attempt to open the same file simultaneously. To fix this, you decide to use a decorator to ensure that only one thread can execute the `open` method at a time.

Here's your task:  
1. Implement a thread-safe version of the `FileManager` class using a decorator.
2. Explain how this solution ensures thread safety and why it is effective.";"[A] The solution uses the `threading.Lock()` to ensure that only one thread can execute the `open` method at a time, making it thread-safe. This is effective because it prevents multiple threads from opening and closing the file simultaneously, which could lead to data corruption or other issues.

[B] The decorator ensures that each file is only opened once by using a class variable to track whether the file has already been opened. However, this approach does not ensure true thread safety because it relies on shared state without proper synchronization mechanisms.

[C] The solution uses `asyncio.Lock()` instead of `threading.Lock()`, making it suitable for asynchronous operations. While this is a step in the right direction, it still lacks proper synchronization across threads and processes, thus not ensuring true thread safety.

[D] The implementation does not require any changes because the original code already ensures thread safety by checking if the file is open before attempting to close it.

What will be the output of the above code when run? Explain why.

A) 0, 0
B) 1, 1
C) 2, 1
D) 1, 2";"Answer: C) 2, 1

Explanation:
The `call_count` decorator is designed to count how many times a method is called. However, the issue lies in how decorators are applied and shared across class methods. In Python, when you apply a decorator to multiple methods of a class using direct assignment like `FunctionCounter.method1 = call_count(FunctionCounter.method1)`, the decorator's state (in this case, `call_count`) is not preserved or shared between these methods.

In the provided code:
- The first two method calls (`fc.method1()` twice) correctly increment the `call_count` for `method1`.
- The third method call (`fc.method2()`) does not affect `method1`'s count because it was already assigned a different state with its own separate `call_count`.

Thus, `FunctionCounter.method1.call_count` remains 2 (since it was only incremented twice), and `FunctionCounter.method2.call_count` is still 0 (as it was never called)."

**Question:** Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a class decorator which measures and prints the execution time of any method in the decorated class. The goal is to enhance each method's functionality without modifying its implementation.

```python
import time

def measure_time(cls):
    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(value):
            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))
    return cls

def _time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f""Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@measure_time
class ExampleClass:
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(1)
```

**Question:** What is the issue with this implementation of the `measure_time` decorator, and how might you fix it to ensure that the original method behavior remains intact?

A) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.

B) The decorator modifies the class in-place which could cause issues if multiple instances are created.

C) The `wrapper` function is not capturing the correct reference of the original method.

D) The `measure_time` decorator should be a metaclass instead of a class decorator to avoid modifying the class directly.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer:** A) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.

**Explanation:** The current implementation assumes that all attributes in the class dictionary are callable methods, but it fails to distinguish between static methods and instance methods. When a method is called on an instance, Python first checks if it exists in the instance's `__dict__`, then in its class. Since the decorator replaces all callables with wrappers, it mistakenly tries to wrap static methods as well, leading to errors.

To fix this, you need to ensure that only instance methods are wrapped. Here is a corrected version of the `measure_time` decorator:

```python
import time

def measure_time(cls):
    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(value) and not isinstance(value, staticmethod):
            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))
    return cls

def _time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f""Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@measure_time
class ExampleClass:
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    @staticmethod
    def method2():
        time.sleep(1)
```

In this corrected version, the decorator checks if the callable is not a staticmethod using `isinstance(value, staticmethod)` before wrapping it, ensuring that only instance methods are modified."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

        print(""Connecting to the database..."")

# Usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1 is db2)  # What will this print?
```

What does the code above print when `db1` and `db2` are compared using the `is` operator?

A) False  
B) True  
C) An error  
D) The message ""Connecting to the database..."" twice";"B) True

Explanation: In the provided code, both `db1` and `db2` will refer to the same instance of the `DatabaseConnection` class because of the singleton pattern implemented through both a metaclass (`Singleton`) and a decorator (`singleton`). The `metaclass=Singleton` ensures that only one instance of any class decorated with this metaclass can be created. Thus, when `db1 = DatabaseConnection()` and `db2 = DatabaseConnection()`, `db1 is db2` evaluates to True because they both reference the same object."

Which statement is true regarding the above code?

A) The `Timer` class is a metaclass and does not support context management.

B) The `timed_function` decorator measures the execution time of any function it decorates.

C) Using `@timed_function`, the execution time of `compute_sum(1000000)` will be printed before its result.

D) The `Timer` class uses a descriptor for its context management functionality.";"[ANSWER]
B) The `timed_function` decorator measures the execution time of any function it decorates.

Explanation:
- The `Timer` class is not a metaclass but a simple context manager that prints the time taken by the block of code inside its `with` statement.
- The `timed_function` decorator correctly wraps any function to measure and print its execution time. It uses Python's built-in timing functions from the `time` module to calculate the duration and prints it after the decorated function completes.
- The `Timer` class indeed supports context management using the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, which are used in the example with the `with Timer('compute_sum'):` statement.
- Descriptors are not involved in the implementation of context management or decorators as shown in this code."

"2025-05-20 16:01";"";"**Part 1: Question**

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class with a custom attribute:

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['custom_attr'] = 'Hello, World!'

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Instantiate the class and access the custom attribute
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.custom_attr)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) `MyClass` will not have a `custom_attr` attribute because metaclasses are used for defining classes, not instances.

B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will inherit from the metaclass and automatically get the `custom_attr` attribute with the value 'Hello, World!'.

C) The `Meta` metaclass can only be used to add attributes to a class if it is specified when the class is defined.

D) Accessing `obj.custom_attr` will raise an AttributeError because `MyClass` does not define any attributes.

**Part 2: Answer**

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- Option A is incorrect. The metaclass `Meta` successfully adds a custom attribute `custom_attr` to the class `MyClass`. When you instantiate `MyClass`, this attribute is available.
- Option B is correct. The `__new__` method of the metaclass `Meta` is called when `MyClass` is defined, not when an instance of it is created. It adds a new attribute `custom_attr` to the class dictionary before the class is finalized.
- Option C is incorrect. A metaclass can be used to add attributes to any class that uses it, regardless of how often or where it is specified.
- Option D is incorrect. Since `custom_attr` is added by the metaclass, it will be accessible on instances of `MyClass`."
"2025-05-21 00:01";"[QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern. A singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

```python

        if cls not in cls._instances:

What will be the output of the `use_database` function when it is called?

A) Both `db1` and `db2` are new instances, so their identities are different.
B) Both `db1` and `db2` refer to the same instance, so their identities are the same.
C) An error will be raised because metaclasses cannot be used with singletons.
D) The output is unpredictable due to issues with garbage collection.";"B) Both `db1` and `db2` refer to the same instance, so their identities are the same.

Explanation:
The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of the `Database` class is created. When `use_database` is called, it attempts to create two instances (`db1` and `db2`). However, because of the singleton pattern enforced by the metaclass, both variables end up referencing the same instance, as stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`, indicating that they are indeed the same object."

**Question:** Consider the following Python code that aims to create a simple rate limiter decorator. The goal is to ensure that a function can only be called once every `interval` seconds. However, the implementation has an issue.

```python

        last_call_time = 0

    print(""Function is called"")

# Example usage:
my_function()  # Calls the function normally
time.sleep(0.5)
my_function()  # Should wait for 0.5 seconds before calling again
```

Which of the following statements correctly identifies a problem with this implementation?

A) The `rate_limit` decorator does not properly handle the case when multiple instances of `my_function` are called concurrently.

B) The use of a nonlocal variable inside the wrapper function can lead to memory leaks under certain conditions.

C) The sleep time calculation in the wrapper is incorrect, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.

D) The `last_call_time` variable is not thread-safe, which could result in unexpected behavior when called from multiple threads.";"**Answer:** A

**Explanation:** The issue with the provided implementation is that it does not handle concurrent calls correctly. When multiple instances of `my_function` are called concurrently, each call will check the global `last_call_time`, which can lead to all instances waiting for their turn instead of only one instance at a time. This defeats the purpose of rate limiting. The decorator should maintain separate state for each instance or thread if concurrent access is expected."

D) Error: Cannot run inside async context";"A) Task started  
   Task completed  
   None  

Explanation:
- The `AsyncDecorator` is a class that takes an asynchronous function (`async_task`) as its argument.
- When the decorated function is called, it uses `asyncio.run()` to execute the asynchronous function in a new event loop. This is necessary because `asyncio.run()` is used for running top-level entry point coroutines and should be called only once per program.
- Inside `async_task`, an asyncio sleep of 1 second is simulated using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`.
- When `async_task` completes, the function prints ""Task completed"".
- Since the result of `async_task` is not explicitly returned or captured, it defaults to `None`. Therefore, the final printed output is `Task started`, `Task completed`, and `None`.

Imagine you're developing a web framework in Python, and you want to ensure that all routes defined are secure. You decide to implement a decorator `@secure` that logs the user ID and route accessed before executing the view function. However, you also want this decorator to be reusable across different classes without manually applying it to each method.

Here's a simplified version of what you have:

```python
from functools import wraps

def secure(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        user_id = kwargs.get('user_id')
        route = func.__name__
        print(f""Accessing {route} by user {user_id}"")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class SecureView:

        return ""Welcome to the homepage""

    @secure
    def profile(self, user_id=None):
        return ""This is your profile""
```

Now, you want to create a metaclass that automatically applies this `@secure` decorator to all methods of any class it decorates. This way, you can simply define your view classes without worrying about applying the decorator manually.

Here's your task:
1. Implement a metaclass `SecureMeta` that applies the `@secure` decorator to all non-static methods of any class.
2. Create a class `SecureApp` using this metaclass and define some methods like `home`, `dashboard`, etc.

Write the code for `SecureMeta` and an example usage of `SecureApp`.";"[ANSWER]

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` correctly logs all attribute accesses on instances of `MyClass`.
B) The method `log_access` is added to `MyClass` via the metaclass.
C) The original `__getattribute__` method is preserved and called when accessing attributes.
D) The class `MyClass` cannot be instantiated because of a missing constructor.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The original `__getattribute__` method is preserved and called when accessing attributes.

Explanation:
The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` correctly modifies the `__getattribute__` method of any class it decorates. It wraps the original `__getattribute__` with a new function that logs access to attributes before delegating to the original method. This ensures that all attribute accesses are logged, and the original behavior is preserved.

Option A is incorrect because no logging occurs on attribute access directly; only method calls log access.
Option B is incorrect because no `log_access` method is added; instead, `__getattribute__` is modified.
Option D is incorrect because there is no issue with instantiating `MyClass`; it can be instantiated normally."

C) The `writer.write` method blocks until the data is fully sent to the client.

D) The `main` function runs in a separate thread.

### Part 2 (Answer)

**";"** C

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The `handle_request` function is defined as an asynchronous function with the `async def` syntax, which means it will run asynchronously.
  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The `asyncio.start_server` function creates an asynchronous server. It allows handling multiple client connections concurrently without blocking.

- **Option C**: Correct. The `writer.write` method does not block; it schedules data to be sent and returns immediately. The actual sending happens later, which is why we need to call `await writer.drain()` to ensure the data has been fully sent before closing the connection.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. The `main` function runs in the main thread of the asyncio event loop. If you want it to run in a separate thread, you would typically use `threading` or `concurrent.futures`, but that's not related to how this server is set up.

This question tests understanding of how asyncio works for creating non-blocking servers and how methods like `write` and `drain` function in asynchronous programming."

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `AsyncDecorator` class does not use any asyncio features.

B) When calling `fetch_data`, it will block the event loop until the data is fetched.

C) The `fetch_data` function is automatically converted into a coroutine when decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`.

D) The decorator correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions seamlessly.";"D) The decorator correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions seamlessly.

Explanation: 
The `AsyncDecorator` class defines an `__init__` method that stores the original function, and a `__call__` method that uses `asyncio.run()` to execute the decorated function within the asyncio event loop. Since `fetch_data` is defined as an `async def`, it does not need to be made synchronous; it can be directly run using `asyncio.run()`. Therefore, the decorator correctly handles asynchronous functions without interfering with their async nature."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to automatically log any method call on an instance of a class. The goal is to understand how this works in detail.

Which of the following statements correctly describes how to use and understand the metaclass `LogMeta` in this code?

A) The `MyClass` automatically logs all its methods when called.  
B) The `log_method_call` static method is applied to each instance method of classes that inherit from `MyClass`.  
C) The `LogMeta` only works for class attributes and not for instance methods.  
D) Any class inheriting from `MyClass` can call methods without logging because the metaclass does not affect them.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `MyClass` automatically logs all its methods when called.
This statement is incorrect. The metaclass `LogMeta` intercepts and modifies the class definition, adding a log decorator to each callable attribute (methods). However, this change affects the class itself, not individual instances.

B) The `log_method_call` static method is applied to each instance method of classes that inherit from `MyClass`.
This statement is correct. When a class inherits from `MyClass`, its methods are wrapped by the `log_method_call` decorator during the metaclass's `__new__` method execution. This means every time an instance method of any subclass is called, it will print a log message.

C) The `LogMeta` only works for class attributes and not for instance methods.
This statement is incorrect. As shown in the code, the metaclass applies to all callable attributes, including instance methods, when defining classes that use it as their metaclass.

D) Any class inheriting from `MyClass` can call methods without logging because the metaclass does not affect them.
This statement is incorrect. Due to the modification applied by the metaclass during the definition of subclasses, calling any method on an instance of a subclass will automatically include log output."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure all instances of a class have a unique identifier:

Explanation: The `UniqueIDMeta` metaclass uses a class-level variable `_instance_id` to keep track of the number of instances created. When an instance is created, it assigns the current value of `_instance_id` as its id and then increments `_instance_id`. Therefore, when `a = MyClass()` is executed, `a.id` is set to 0, and when `b = MyClass()` is executed, `b.id` is set to 1."

This code defines a context manager `Timer` that measures and prints the execution time of any block of code it wraps. When `timed_function()` is called, it runs a loop for 1 million iterations inside the `with` statement.

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `__exit__` method will never be called if an exception occurs within the `with` block.
B) The `Timer` class can be used as both a decorator and a context manager.
C) The `Timer` class cannot be subclassed to add new functionality.
D) The `Timer` class uses Python's garbage collector to manage its resources.";"B) The `Timer` class can be used as both a decorator and a context manager.

Explanation:
The provided code snippet demonstrates the use of a context manager. However, it does not provide any indication that this class could also be used as a decorator. Decorators are typically implemented using functions or classes that wrap another function or method, while context managers are used with `with` statements to manage resources like file handles or timers.

For a class to be usable both as a context manager and a decorator, it would need separate methods for these purposes, which is not the case here. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.

Statement A is also incorrect because if an exception occurs within the `with` block, the `__exit__` method will still be called to handle any cleanup or error handling as specified in the context manager protocol.

Option C is incorrect because a class can always be subclassed to add new functionality. The `Timer` class could be extended with additional methods or attributes without breaking its basic functionality.

Statement D is also incorrect as the `Timer` class does not rely on Python's garbage collector for managing its resources. Instead, it manages resources explicitly by using methods like `__enter__` and `__exit__`, which are part of the context management protocol."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `MyClass` will not be instantiated because `LogMeta` prevents instantiation.
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will log ""Instantiating MyClass"".
C) There will be a runtime error because `LogMeta` does not properly define the `__call__` method.
D) The `LogMeta` class must explicitly call `super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)` to allow instantiation.";"B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will log ""Instantiating MyClass"".

Explanation:
The `LogMeta` metaclass correctly overrides the `__new__` method to print a message whenever a class is instantiated. The metaclass's job is to customize class creation, and in this case, it logs a message before calling the superclass's `__new__` method to actually create the class. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `LogMeta` metaclass will be invoked, resulting in the log message ""Instantiating MyClass"" being printed."

B) It will print ""Before calling"", wait for 1 second, then print ""After calling"" and finally output ""Result: 9"".

C) It will execute the function synchronously without any additional prints.

D) The program will hang indefinitely because it is waiting for an infinite loop inside `my_async_function`.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A) C

Explanation:
- The code defines a class decorator `AsyncDecorator` that wraps around an asynchronous function.
- When `my_async_function` is decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`, the decorator's `__call__` method is invoked when the function is called, not when it’s defined.
- Inside `AsyncDecorator.__call__`, ""Before calling"" is printed, then the decorated function (`self.func`) is awaited. During this await, control yields back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run.
- After the awaited task completes (in this case, after 1 second), ""After calling"" is printed, and the result of `my_async_function` is returned.
- When `main()` runs, it calls `await my_async_function(3)`, which results in ""Before calling"", a 1-second delay, then ""After calling"", followed by ""Result: 9"".
- Option A is incorrect because the decorator does handle async functions correctly. Options B and D are incorrect as there's no infinite loop or hanging behavior."

Explanation: In the given code, `await asyncio.sleep(1)` is used to simulate an I/O operation that would block if it were run synchronously. However, because the tasks are awaited using `asyncio.gather`, Python's event loop allows other tasks to run while waiting for the sleep to complete.

B) The `LogMeta` metaclass applies the `log_decorator` to all callable attributes of `MyClass`, effectively wrapping them with a print statement before and after their execution.

C) Using `ContextDecorator` in `LogDecorator` ensures that the `with` statement can be used to manage context, but it will not affect the behavior when called as a regular decorator.

D) The use of both metaclass and decorators on the same methods results in double wrapping due to overlapping effects.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**B**

The `LogMeta` metaclass applies the `log_decorator` to all callable attributes of `MyClass`. This means that both `method1` and `method2` are wrapped with the `log_decorator`, resulting in two ""Before calling function"" and ""After calling function"" outputs when they are called. The `ContextDecorator` class is used in `LogDecorator` to ensure it can be used as a context manager, but this does not affect how it behaves when applied as a decorator.

The other statements are incorrect because:
- A) While both methods are wrapped with the `log_decorator`, each method is only wrapped once.
- C) The use of `ContextDecorator` allows the decorator to function as a context manager, but this does not prevent it from also being used as a regular decorator.
- D) The metaclass and decorators do not result in double wrapping. Each method is decorated only once by both the metaclass and the explicit decorator application."

- The metaclass `Meta` modifies any class it decorates by adding a method `add` that takes an argument and returns the argument incremented by 5.
- When `MyClass` is defined with `metaclass=Meta`, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called to create the class, and the `add` method is added to the class dictionary.
- An instance of `MyClass` is created and the `add` method is called on this instance with the argument 10.

C) The code will raise a `RuntimeError` because the logger is not properly managed.  
D) The output will be ""INFO: Starting"", ""INFO: Processing"", and it will hang waiting for the final ""Ending"".";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Answer:** B) The output will be ""INFO: Starting"", ""INFO: Processing"", ""INFO: Ending"" in that specific order.

**Explanation:**

The given code uses `asyncio.gather` to concurrently run multiple tasks, each of which logs a message. Since all tasks are awaited within the `main` function, they will execute in sequence because `asyncio.gather` schedules them to run as soon as possible but does not guarantee their order if there is any overlap.

To ensure that `logger` is not garbage collected before all logging tasks complete, we need to keep a reference to it. In Python, an object is considered garbage collectible only when there are no more references pointing to it. By keeping the `logger` variable in scope until after all tasks have completed, it ensures that it remains alive long enough for the garbage collector to determine if it can be freed.

For example:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncLogger:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    async def log(self, message):
        print(f""{self.name}: {message}"")

async def main():
    logger = AsyncLogger(""INFO"")
    await asyncio.gather(
        logger.log(""Starting""),
        logger.log(""Processing""),
        logger.log(""Ending"")
    )
    del logger  # Explicitly deleting the reference to allow garbage collection

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this modified version, the `logger` variable is explicitly deleted after all tasks have completed. This ensures that `logger` can be garbage collected if no other references to it exist. However, in practical scenarios, you generally don’t need to explicitly delete variables as Python’s garbage collector handles most cases automatically."

**Explanation:** The `CoroutineDecorator` class is designed to be a decorator for asynchronous functions. When `my_decorated_coroutine` is called, it first runs the undecorated `my_coroutine`, and then proceeds with its own logic. Since `asyncio.run()` is used inside the decorator to execute the decorated coroutine, both the original and decorated coroutine methods are executed within the same event loop run by `asyncio.run()`. This results in the outputs being interleaved as shown in option A."

Consider the following Python code that aims to create a context manager for measuring the execution time of a block of code:

```python

        self.start = time.time()

However, when trying to use this context manager with an asynchronous function, it fails. Your task is to modify the `Timer` class so that it can be used both synchronously and asynchronously.

A) Modify the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to use asyncio's event loop if it exists.
B) Create a separate `AsyncTimer` class that inherits from `Timer` but overrides the context management protocol for async contexts.
C) Use a decorator to convert the `Timer` class into an asynchronous context manager.
D) Implement a new method called `async_enter` and `async_exit` and use them instead of `__enter__` and `__exit__`.";"B) Create a separate `AsyncTimer` class that inherits from `Timer` but overrides the context management protocol for async contexts.

Explanation:
The correct answer is option B. To make the existing `Timer` class work with asynchronous functions, we need to create an `AsyncTimer` class that overrides the context management protocol specifically for use in asynchronous code. This involves implementing methods like `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` instead of the standard `__enter__` and `__exit__`. The existing `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods should be preserved for synchronous use, as they will still work with non-async contexts. By creating a subclass specifically for async usage, we maintain compatibility with both synchronous and asynchronous code without modifying the original class's behavior."

C) Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method  
D) An error will occur because `my_decorator` cannot be applied to methods in Python 3

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is C) Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method.

Explanation: In Python 3, decorators can indeed be applied to instance methods within a class using metaclasses or by directly applying decorators at method definition. Here's how it works:

- When you apply `@my_decorator` above the method `my_method`, it wraps the method with another function that adds some pre and post-execution behavior.
- The `__metaclass__ = type` in the class declaration is necessary because, starting from Python 3, classes are first-class objects and need a metaclass to be properly instantiated. If you omit this line, Python will raise an error because it cannot instantiate a class without a valid metaclass.

Therefore, when you create an instance `obj` of `MyClass` and call `obj.my_method()`, the output will be as follows:
1. The pre-function call message is printed.
2. The method's code runs, printing ""Hello from my_method"".
3. The post-function call message is printed.

This demonstrates that decorators can indeed modify class methods in Python 3, even when using metaclasses for class instantiation."

C) Task started

D) Task started  
   Task finished after 3 seconds  
   Main function completed

**Part 2: Answer**

A) Task started  
   Task finished  
   Main function completed

**Explanation:** 

The `AsyncTimer` class is a decorator that delays the execution of any coroutine it decorates by the specified delay. In this case, `@AsyncTimer(2)` means that any coroutine passed to it will have its execution delayed by 2 seconds before proceeding.

When you call `await slow_task()` in the `main` function, `slow_task` is decorated with `AsyncTimer(2)`. This means that when `slow_task` is called, it first waits for 2 seconds (due to the decorator), and then proceeds with its original execution. The output will therefore be:

1. ""Task started"" (immediately)
2. Task finishes after an additional 2 seconds (""Task finished"")
3. Then, after another second (total of 3 seconds), ""Main function completed""

So, option A is the correct answer as it matches the described behavior."

D) Each thread prints its own key-value pair and finally, 'Final config' will be `{'key_0': 'value_4'}`";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Each thread prints its own key-value pair and finally, 'Final config' will be `{'key_0': 'value_0'}`  

Explanation:
- The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of the `ConfigManager` class is created.
- However, since there is no synchronization mechanism in place (e.g., locks), multiple threads can modify the `configs` dictionary simultaneously, leading to race conditions.
- When a thread writes to `self.configs[key]`, it may not see the most up-to-date value written by another thread due to these race conditions. This explains why the output of each thread printing its own key-value pair but the final config having only one entry (`{'key_0': 'value_4'}`) is possible.
- The actual final config will depend on the timing and order in which threads complete their operations, so `{'key_0': 'value_0'}` is a plausible output among others."

Explanation:

The provided code defines an async decorator `async_decorator` that wraps around another asynchronous function `my_async_function`.

When `main()` is executed, it creates a list of tasks for `my_async_function`, which are then gathered and awaited concurrently. 

The output shows each ""Before calling function"" print statement five times, followed by ""After calling function"" five times. This indicates that the decorator was called correctly five times, once for each task created in the `main()` function. The actual results of the asynchronous tasks (0*2=0, 1*2=2, 2*2=4, 3*2=6, 4*2=8) are not printed because the decorator is only responsible for printing messages before and after the function call.

The correct answer demonstrates an understanding of how decorators work with asynchronous functions in Python, specifically how they can be used to add behavior (in this case, logging) around the execution of other functions."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a simple caching mechanism using decorators. The goal is to cache the results of function calls based on their arguments.

```python

Which of the following is a correct statement regarding the `fibonacci` function when using the `cache_results` decorator?

A) The first call to `fibonacci(5)` will compute all previous Fibonacci numbers up to 3.

B) Subsequent calls to `fibonacci(n)` where `n <= 1` will not be cached.

C) The cache will store results for all arguments passed to `fibonacci`.

D) The cache will only store results for unique sequences of recursive calls that lead to different outcomes.";"[ANSWER] D) The cache will only store results for unique sequences of recursive calls that lead to different outcomes.

**Explanation**: The `cache_results` decorator is designed to cache the results of function calls based on their arguments. In this case, it caches the results of the Fibonacci sequence calculations. When a call to `fibonacci(n)` is made, the decorator first checks if the result for those arguments is already in the cache. If not, it computes the result using the function (in this case, the Fibonacci calculation), stores it in the cache, and then returns the result. For recursive functions like `fibonacci`, different sequences of calls to reach the same base case will produce different results, leading to unique keys in the cache. Therefore, only those unique sequences of recursive calls will be cached."

C) The timer will start but not perform any action.
D) The program will hang indefinitely without printing anything.";"Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is A) The program will print ""Timer tick"" every second.

Explanation: In the provided code, `AsyncTimer` starts an asynchronous task that runs `run()` method using `asyncio.create_task()`. Inside the `run()` method, there's a loop that sleeps for the specified interval (1 second in this case) and then calls the callback function (`on_timer`).

B) Data from http://example.com/0, Data from http://example.com/1, Data from http://example.com/2, Data from http://example.com/3, Data from http://example.com/4

Explanation: The `asyncio.gather` function runs all the coroutines concurrently and waits for all of them to complete. Each coroutine fetches data from a URL in an asynchronous manner. When all coroutines finish, their results are gathered and printed.

Option A is incorrect because it only prints the ""Fetching"" messages before the sleep completes.

D) None of the above.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B: The string ""Hello from metaclass!"" is printed when an instance of `MyClass` is created and the attribute is accessed.

Explanation:
- When a class like `MyClass` is decorated with `Meta`, Python's class creation process invokes the metaclass's `__new__` method.
- In this case, the metaclass `Meta` modifies the dictionary `dct` that defines the class by adding an entry `'added_attribute': 'Hello from metaclass!'`.
- The `super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)` call in `Meta.__new__()` creates a new class with these modifications.
- Therefore, when an instance of `MyClass` is created and the attribute `added_attribute` is accessed on that instance, it correctly returns the string 'Hello from metaclass!'."

A) It enforces that all classes decorated with `class_decorator` must have a class variable named 'decorated'.
B) It ensures that `MyClass` has an attribute called 'decorated' set to True.
C) It raises an error if any class is defined without being decorated, regardless of the decorator used.
D) It checks that all classes using it as their metaclass have a method named 'decorated'.

### Part 2 (Answer)

A) It enforces that all classes decorated with `class_decorator` must have a class variable named 'decorated'.
Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks if the `decorated` attribute is present in the class dictionary during class creation. If it's not found, it raises a `TypeError`. Only `MyClass`, which is decorated with `@class_decorator`, has this attribute set.

B) It ensures that `MyClass` has an attribute called 'decorated' set to True.
Explanation: This is incorrect because the metaclass itself checks for the presence of the `decorated` attribute, not the class decorator. The actual setting happens in the `class_decorator`.

C) It raises an error if any class is defined without being decorated, regardless of the decorator used.
Explanation: This is also incorrect. The metaclass only enforces this rule if it is explicitly used with a decorator that sets the `decorated` attribute.

D) It checks that all classes using it as their metaclass have a method named 'decorated'.

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `add_method` method will not be added to any class that does not use `AddMethodMeta`.
B) When creating an instance of `MyClass`, it immediately calls `new_method` and prints ""Hello from new_method"".
C) Calling `obj.new_method()` will raise an AttributeError.
D) The metaclass is used to dynamically add a method to all classes in the application.";"D) The metaclass is used to dynamically add a method to all classes in the application.

Explanation: In Python, a metaclass is a class that creates and controls other classes. When you define a class with `metaclass=AddMethodMeta`, every instance of that class will have a new method called `new_method`. This is true regardless of whether other classes use the same metaclass or not. The `MyClass` defined in this example is an exception to this rule, as it does not explicitly declare `new_method`, but instances of any class using `AddMethodMeta` will have access to it. Option A is incorrect because only classes explicitly decorated with `AddMethodMeta` will get the new method. Options B and C are incorrect because calling `obj.new_method()` on an instance of a class that does not use `AddMethodMeta` would raise an AttributeError, but since `MyClass` is an exception to this rule, it would not be the case here."

Explanation:
The provided code attempts to make all callable attributes thread-safe using a metaclass. However, in Python, class methods (like `increment`, `decrement`, and `get_value`) do not automatically inherit the `self` parameter, which is necessary for instance-level operations. Therefore, when `add_lock` decorates these methods, they lose their instance context, leading to incorrect behavior or runtime errors.

The `AsyncWebServer` class is intended to start a web server that echoes back any received data. However, when you run the script and try to connect to it using a simple client like `telnet`, you encounter an issue where no response is received from the server.

Identify the problem in this code and suggest how to fix it so that the server correctly handles incoming connections and sends responses as expected.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**A) The problem is with the `handle_client` method not properly handling client disconnections.**
**B) The issue lies in the `start` method not properly closing the server when stopping.**

**Explanation:** The problem lies in the `handle_client` method. While it sends a response back to the client when data is received, it does not handle the case where the client disconnects unexpectedly (e.g., by closing their connection). This can cause the server to get stuck waiting for more data from the disconnected client, which prevents it from processing other incoming connections. To fix this issue, you could add a check to see if there's any data available before attempting to read from the reader, or use an exception handler within the `handle_client` method to gracefully handle client disconnections."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

class ThreadSafeCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    @property
    def value(self):
        with self.lock:
            return self._value

    @value.setter
    def value(self, new_value):
        with self.lock:
            self._value = new_value

    def increment(self):
        with self.lock:
            self.value += 1

def worker(counter):
    for _ in range(1000):

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    counter = ThreadSafeCounter()
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(counter,)) for _ in range(10)]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    print(counter.value)
```

This code attempts to create a thread-safe counter using a `ThreadSafeCounter` class with a private attribute `_value` and a lock. The `increment` method is intended to safely increment the value by 1000 across multiple threads.

Which of the following statements is true regarding the above code?

A) The counter will always print 10000 because it uses threading.Lock to ensure thread safety.
B) The counter may print a number less than 10000 due to race conditions in the `increment` method.
C) The counter will always print 10000, but using decorators would make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
D) The counter may print a number greater than 10000 because of potential deadlocks.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The code uses threading to create multiple threads that increment the shared `counter` object. Each thread performs 1000 increments on the counter. The critical section in the `increment` method is protected by a lock, which means that at any given time, only one thread can execute the code within this section.

However, there are race conditions present in the code. Even though each increment operation is atomic (i.e., it cannot be interrupted), multiple threads can still see and modify `_value` concurrently before their changes are fully written back to memory. This can lead to situations where two or more threads read the same value for `_value`, both increment it, and then write back their incremented values, resulting in a net increase of less than 1000 increments.

Therefore, while the lock ensures that individual increment operations are thread-safe, the overall operation is still subject to race conditions when multiple threads attempt to modify the shared counter concurrently. This means that the final value printed by the program may be less than 10000, making option B correct."

A) ""Task completed"" will be printed after 5 seconds.  
B) The program will hang indefinitely as it is waiting for tasks to complete before exiting.

D) ""Coroutine done"" will be printed after 5 seconds and ""Task completed"" will be printed after every interval of 2 seconds until the coroutine completes.";"A) ""Task completed"" will be printed after 5 seconds.  

**Explanation:** The `run` method of `AsyncTimer` continuously checks for tasks that are not done, and if such a task is found, it waits for the interval time (2 seconds in this case) before printing ""Task completed"". Since the coroutine registered with `register` completes after 5 seconds, when `run` wakes up for the first time, it will print ""Task completed"" at that point. After that, since the coroutine has already finished, no further ""Task completed"" messages will be printed even though the loop continues to run."

Imagine you are developing a library that needs to ensure that all its classes implement certain methods. You want to create a metaclass that checks if these methods exist during class creation and raises an error if they are missing.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
class MethodCheckerMeta(type):
    required_methods = ['method1', 'method2']

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for method in cls.required_methods:

                raise TypeError(f""Class {name} must implement the '{method}' method."")

        pass

# This will work fine
obj = MyClass()

# Uncommenting the following line will raise an error
# class MyMissingMethodsClass(metaclass=MethodCheckerMeta):
#     pass
```

Which of the following is a potential issue with this implementation?

A) The metaclass does not allow for any additional methods to be added to subclasses after creation.

B) The metaclass raises an error when trying to subclass a class that already implements all required methods.

C) The metaclass will correctly raise an error if a method is missing in any subclass.

D) The metaclass can dynamically add the missing methods to classes during their creation.";"C) The metaclass will correctly raise an error if a method is missing in any subclass.

The implementation of `MethodCheckerMeta` checks for the presence of required methods during class creation using `__new__`. If all methods are present, the class is created successfully. However, this implementation does not prevent subclasses from being created without implementing these methods, so option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that existing classes cannot be subclassed, which is not a concern of this metaclass. Option D is incorrect as well since methods are not dynamically added to classes; they must be defined at the time of class creation or inheritance. The correct answer is C, as the metaclass raises an error if any required method is missing in any subclass during their creation."

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify a class dynamically:

        dct['new_attr'] = 'New Attribute'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

Which of the following statements is true about the metaclass `Meta` and its effect on `MyClass`?

A) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to instances of `MyClass`.
B) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to the class itself.
C) Instances of `MyClass` do not have access to `new_attr`.
D) The metaclass has no effect on `MyClass`.";"B) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to the class itself.

Explanation: In Python, when you define a metaclass, it controls how classes are created. By modifying the dictionary (`dct`) passed to the `__new__` method, the metaclass can dynamically add or modify attributes at the class level. In this case, `Meta` adds `new_attr` directly to the `MyClass` dictionary, making it a class attribute rather than an instance attribute. Therefore, instances of `MyClass` do not have access to `new_attr`."

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a class with custom behavior:

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.__value = value

obj = MyClass(10)
```

What is the output of `print(obj.value)`?

A) 10  
B) AttributeError  
C) TypeError  
D) None  

### Part 2: Answer

B) AttributeError

Explanation:
The code attempts to create a custom metaclass (`Meta`) that transforms class attributes into properties. The metaclass dynamically renames each attribute by prefixing it with an underscore and creating a property that accesses this new private attribute.

In the `MyClass`, an attribute named `__value` is defined, but due to the metaclass's behavior, there will be no direct access to this attribute from outside the class. Instead, a property named `value` should be created by the metaclass. However, in the provided code, there is no method to handle this transformation correctly.

When you attempt to access `obj.value`, Python looks for an attribute or property with that name on `MyClass`. Since no such property exists due to the incorrect implementation of the metaclass, it raises an `AttributeError`.

The correct behavior would require adding a method in the metaclass to dynamically create and assign properties for each original attribute.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

What is the output of this script? Explain how the use of metaclasses, decorators, and context managers contributes to thread safety in this example.

A) 0  
B) 1  
C) 2  
D) Error";"B) 1  

The output of this script will be `1`. The use of metaclasses (`SingletonMeta`) ensures that the `ThreadSafeSingleton` class is a singleton, meaning only one instance of it can exist. The decorator pattern is not directly used in this example but could be applied to add additional functionality if needed.

Context managers (`DataAdder`) are crucial for managing resources like locks to ensure thread safety when accessing shared data. In this case, the lock prevents multiple threads from entering the `with` block at the same time, ensuring that the data modification is thread-safe.

The `ThreadSafeSingleton` class itself uses a dictionary (`data`) to store data, and the `add_data_to_singleton` function demonstrates how to use the singleton instance within a context manager. The lock ensures that when the 'temp' key is added, it does not interfere with any other thread attempting to access or modify the same key concurrently.

Therefore, after executing the script, the size of the data dictionary will be `1`, indicating that one item has been successfully added through the context manager while maintaining thread safety."
"2025-06-09 16:03";"";"**Part 1 (Question):**

Imagine you are tasked with creating a system for managing user sessions in an asynchronous web application. You want to ensure that each session has a timeout mechanism, and any session that exceeds this time limit should automatically expire. 

You decide to implement this using Python's `asyncio` library. However, you also want to make sure that the session management logic is easily reusable across different parts of your application without duplicating code.

To achieve this, you consider creating a decorator for sessions that automatically handles the timeout. You then create a metaclass that applies this decorator to any class that represents a session.

Here's an example implementation:

```python
import asyncio

def session_timeout(timeout):
    def decorator(cls):
        async def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            task = loop.create_task(self.__aenter__(*args, **kwargs))
            try:
                result = await asyncio.wait_for(task, timeout=timeout)
                return result
            except asyncio.TimeoutError:
                task.cancel()
                raise Exception(""Session timed out"")
        cls.__aenter__ = wrapper
        return cls
    return decorator

class SessionMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'session_timeout' in dct:
            dct['session_timeout'] = session_timeout(dct['session_timeout'])
        return super().__new__(mcls, name, bases, dct)

class AsyncSession(metaclass=SessionMeta):
    async def __aenter__(self):
        pass

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        pass

# Example usage
class UserSession(AsyncSession):
    session_timeout = 30  # Timeout in seconds

async def main():
    async with UserSession() as session:
        # Simulate work within the session
        await asyncio.sleep(25)
        print(""Session is still active"")

# Run the example
asyncio.run(main())
```

In this implementation, `session_timeout` is a decorator that adds a timeout mechanism to any class decorated with it. The `SessionMeta` metaclass applies this decorator to any class that has a `session_timeout` attribute.

**Question:** What will happen if an instance of `UserSession` is used without waiting for the session to expire, and how does the `AsyncSession` class structure support this functionality?

A) The session will remain active indefinitely.
B) The session will expire after 30 seconds due to the timeout mechanism.
C) An exception will be raised because no timeout was specified.
D) The session will raise an error when trying to access its methods.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The session will expire after 30 seconds due to the timeout mechanism.

Explanation:
The `AsyncSession` class uses a metaclass (`SessionMeta`) that applies a decorator (`session_timeout`) to any class it decorates. In this case, `UserSession` has a `session_timeout` attribute set to 30 seconds. When an instance of `UserSession` is used in an asynchronous context manager (i.e., within the `async with` statement), the `__aenter__` method decorated by `@session_timeout(30)` will be invoked. This method runs the session's entry logic and then waits for it to complete, timing out after 30 seconds if it has not already finished. If the session completes within the timeout period, the result is returned; otherwise, an exception is raised indicating that the session timed out.

The `AsyncSession` class structure supports this functionality by defining abstract methods (`__aenter__` and `__aexit__`) for entering and exiting the session context, respectively. These methods can be overridden in subclasses to provide specific behavior when a session begins or ends. The metaclass ensures that any subclass of `AsyncSession` will have its timeout mechanism applied automatically if it includes a `session_timeout` attribute."

D)

AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute '__init__'
```";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The code uses a metaclass (`Meta`) to automatically decorate all callable attributes of the class it creates with the `log_decorator`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created using the context manager, the `__init__` method is not explicitly defined in the class. Since Python's default behavior for creating instances involves calling `__new__` and then `__init__`, but there's no explicit `__init__`, the metaclass does not add a logging decorator to it.

Therefore, when `obj.method1()` and `obj.method2(3, 4)` are called inside the context manager block:
- The `method1` is decorated with `log_decorator`, so it logs its call before executing.
- The `method2` is also decorated with `log_decorator`, logging its call before executing.

This results in the output:

```
Calling method1 with args: (), kwargs: {}
Executing method1
Calling method2 with args: (3,), kwargs: {'b': 4}
Executing method2 with 3 and 4

B) The tasks will run sequentially, completing in around 12.5 seconds.

D) The code will raise an exception because tasks are not defined correctly.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The tasks will run concurrently, completing in around 0.5 seconds.

Explanation: In this example, `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` is used, which schedules all the tasks to run concurrently. Since each task sleeps for a time equal to its index, the total execution time will be dominated by the longest-running task (the one with the highest index). Therefore, the total execution time will be close to 4 seconds (since task 4 takes the most time)."

You are tasked with creating a caching mechanism that can be applied to any function to store the results of previous computations. This caching mechanism should support both synchronous and asynchronous functions, ensuring efficient use of resources without duplicating computation. Here is a simplified version of how such a caching system might look for synchronous functions:

```python
def cache_results(func):
    cached_results = {}
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if (args, kwargs) not in cached_results:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper

@cache_results
def sync_func(x):
    print(f""Computing {x}"")
    return x * 2

For an asynchronous function, we need to adapt the caching mechanism. Here is a proposed solution:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_cache_results(func):
    cached_results = {}
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if (args, kwargs) not in cached_results:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            cached_results[(args, kwargs)] = result
        return cached_results[(args, kwargs)]
    return wrapper

@async_cache_results
async def async_func(x):
    print(f""Computing {x}"")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an I/O operation
    return x * 3
```

Now, let's test our caching mechanisms:

```python
import time

# Testing synchronous function
start = time.time()
print(sync_func(5))  # Should compute and print 10
time.sleep(1)
print(sync_func(5))  # Should not recompute, just return the cached result
end = time.time()
print(f""Synchronous caching took {end - start} seconds"")

# Testing asynchronous function
async def test_async():
    start = time.time()
    await async_func(5)  # Should compute and print 15
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    await async_func(5)  # Should not recompute, just return the cached result
    end = time.time()
    print(f""Asynchronous caching took {end - start} seconds"")

asyncio.run(test_async())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the functionality and limitations of this caching mechanism?

A. The caching mechanism works for both synchronous and asynchronous functions, and it significantly speeds up computation by avoiding redundant calculations.
B. The caching mechanism does not work with asynchronous functions because asyncio's event loop is needed to handle await expressions, which are not supported outside of an async function.

D. The caching mechanism is flawed because it does not properly invalidate cache entries when inputs change, leading to incorrect results.";"[ANSWER] C. The caching mechanism correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions but may consume more memory due to storing results in a dictionary that grows indefinitely.

After all tasks have completed (due to the `await asyncio.sleep(2)` in each task), the results are gathered and printed. Thus, the messages ""Fetching data..."" appear first, followed by the printed results of the tasks."

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to control class creation:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'abstract' in dct:
            del dct['abstract']
            return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        else:
            raise TypeError(f""{name} must be an abstract class"")

class Animal(ABC, metaclass=Meta):
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(""Woof!"")

try:
    cat = Animal()
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

What will be the output of this code when run?

A) ""Woof!""  
B) TypeError: Animal must be an abstract class  
C) RuntimeWarning: implicit call to '__init__' in a collection  
D) SyntaxError: invalid syntax";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B) TypeError: Animal must be an abstract class.

Explanation:
In the provided code, the `Meta` metaclass is used to ensure that any subclass of `Animal` must explicitly declare itself as an abstract class by including the key 'abstract' in its dictionary. Since `Animal` does not declare itself as an abstract class and inherits from `ABC`, the metaclass raises a `TypeError` indicating that `Animal` must be an abstract class."

Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a decorator to measure execution time:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Execution time of {func.__name__}: {end_time - start_time} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def my_function(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        sum += i * i
    return sum

print(my_function(10000))
```

What is the issue with this decorator and how can it be fixed to correctly measure execution time?

A) The `wrapper` function does not store the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, leading to incorrect execution time measurements.

B) The `timer` decorator should use a class instead of a function for better code organization and potential future enhancements.

C) The `wrapper` function does not release any resources it might acquire during execution, which could lead to resource leaks.

D) None of the above. The decorator is correctly implemented to measure execution time.";"A) The `wrapper` function does not store the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, leading to incorrect execution time measurements.

The issue with the current implementation is that while it measures the time taken by the function call and prints it, it does not actually use the returned value. This can lead to confusion if the function's return value is being used elsewhere in the code. To fix this, you should store and return the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)` within the `wrapper` function."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f""Fetching data from {url}"")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f""Data for {url}""

async def main():
    urls = ['http://example.com', 'http://example.org', 'http://example.net']
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the provided code?

A) The `fetch_data` function is a synchronous function that fetches data from the given URL.
B) The `main` function uses `asyncio.gather` to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and waits for all of them to complete.
C) The `await asyncio.sleep(1)` in `fetch_data` will block the entire program until 1 second has passed.
D) The code will not execute because it is missing a decorator or context manager.";"B) The `main` function uses `asyncio.gather` to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and waits for all of them to complete.

Explanation: The code correctly demonstrates the use of asynchronous functions with `await` in an `asyncio` event loop. The `fetch_data` function is defined with `async def`, indicating it's an asynchronous function that performs a non-blocking operation using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`. The `main` function creates a list of tasks by calling `fetch_data` with different URLs and then uses `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` to run all these tasks concurrently. Finally, it waits for all tasks to complete before printing their results. This demonstrates effective use of asynchronous programming in Python to handle multiple I/O-bound operations efficiently."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a class decorator for logging method calls. The decorator should log the name of the method being called along with its arguments.

```python
def log_method_calls(cls):
    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(value) and not name.startswith('__'):
            setattr(cls, name, type(name)(lambda self, *args, **kwargs: 
                print(f""Calling {name} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"") or value(self, *args, **kwargs)))
    return cls

@log_method_calls
class Calculator:
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y
    
    def multiply(self, x, y):
        return x * y
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The decorator will successfully log all method calls on instances of `Calculator`.

B) When an instance of `Calculator` is created and methods are called, the original method implementations will not be executed.

C) The decorator does not work because it attempts to replace the method with a new function that logs but fails to preserve the method signature.

D) All methods in the `Calculator` class must be defined using lambda functions for this decorator to work correctly.";"C"
