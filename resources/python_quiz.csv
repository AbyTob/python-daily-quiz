**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that aims to create a decorator for asynchronous functions. The goal is to measure the execution time of an async function. However, the current implementation does not work as expected.

```python
import asyncio

def time_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def sample_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return ""Done""

# Running the function to test
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(sample_async_function())
```

What is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed?

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
B) The decorator works as expected, but the output format is incorrect.  
C) The decorator should use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):` instead of `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`.  
D) The decorator should not measure execution time for asynchronous functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
Explanation: The issue with the code lies in how the timing is being recorded. Since `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a function that provides the current time, it should be called directly to get the actual timestamp, not awaited. The correct usage would be `start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` and `end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`. This will give the current event loop's time in seconds when the function starts and ends, allowing the difference to calculate execution time.

Imagine you are developing a web application where users can upload files. You want to ensure that only specific types of files (e.g., .txt, .pdf) can be uploaded. To achieve this, you decide to use decorators and metaclasses in Python.

You create a decorator `@allowed_file_types` that checks if the file type is allowed. Then, you define a metaclass `FileTypeMeta` that automatically applies the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to any class derived from it, setting the allowed types as a parameter.

Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```python
def allowed_file_types(*types):
    def wrapper(cls):
        cls.allowed_types = types
        return cls
    return wrapper

class FileTypeMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'allowed_types' not in dct:
            dct['allowed_types'] = ()
        super_new = super(FileTypeMeta, cls).__new__
        return super_new(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AllowedFiles(metaclass=FileTypeMeta):
    pass

class TextFile(AllowedFiles):
    # TODO: Apply the allowed_file_types decorator here
    pass

# Example usage:
txt_file = TextFile()
print(txt_file.allowed_types)  # Should print ('.txt',)
```

Which of the following ways can you correctly apply the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to the `TextFile` class using the metaclass?

A) Use a direct assignment in the class definition.
B) Override the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute.
C) Use a class variable directly within the class definition.
D) Call the `@allowed_file_types` decorator directly on the class.";"Part 2 (Answer): 
A) Direct assignment is not an option because decorators are applied before the class is fully defined, and direct assignment would occur after the class is created.

B) Correct. By overriding the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute, you can ensure that any subclass of `AllowedFiles` will have its `allowed_types` attribute set by default if not explicitly provided.

C) This would work but doesn't utilize the decorator mechanism and isn't as clean or flexible as using a metaclass.

D) Calling the decorator directly on the class is also not correct because it bypasses the metaclass's influence, which should be used to set the `allowed_types` attribute."

You are developing a Python library that needs to provide thread-safe logging functionality. You want to ensure that log messages from different threads do not interfere with each other, even when they are written simultaneously. Implement a decorator that can be applied to any function to make it thread-safe using locks.

```python
import threading

# Your solution goes here

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    # Decorator code
    pass

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

Choose the correct implementation for the `thread_safe_logger` decorator:

A)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    with lock:
        print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

C)  
```python
def thread_safe_logger(func):
    lock = threading.Lock()
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

D)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            print(f""Log: {message}"")
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```";"B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

**Explanation**: The correct implementation is option B. In this solution, the `lock` is defined outside of the decorator function so that it is not recreated with each decorated function call. This ensures that all calls to the decorated functions use the same lock, making the logging thread-safe."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator to measure the execution time of any function it decorates:

```python
import time

def time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

However, there is a common pitfall with this decorator that can lead to incorrect measurements. What is the issue with this code and how would you fix it?

A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

B) The decorator captures the start time too late, leading to inaccurate timing.

C) The decorator does not allow the function to be called without any arguments.

D) The decorator does not account for recursive calls properly.";"A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

**Explanation:**
The provided decorator `time_decorator` is synchronous and will measure the total execution time of a synchronous function by capturing the start time before the function call and the end time after the function call. However, it does not account for the case where the function itself might be a coroutine (an asynchronous function). To handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly, you would need to modify the decorator to check if the decorated function is a coroutine using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`. If it is, you should use an asynchronous version of time measurement with `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete`.

A corrected version of the decorator that handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions might look like this:

```python
import asyncio
import time
import inspect

def time_decorator(func):
    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    else:
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

This version of the decorator uses conditional logic to determine whether to measure synchronous or asynchronous functions."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

        await asyncio.sleep(0.3)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `Timer` class can be used as a context manager for synchronous tasks.
B) The `Timer` class does not support asynchronous execution and will block when used in an async context.
C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.
D) Only ""Task 1"" will be able to complete successfully due to a bug.";"C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.

Explanation: The `Timer` class is designed as an asynchronous context manager, which means it can be used in an async block (`async with`). The `__aenter__` method records the start time using `time.time()` and prints a message when entering the block. The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time after exiting the block and prints it. Both tasks, ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"", will run concurrently due to their usage within an async context manager (`async with`). Therefore, both tasks will measure their execution time accurately and print it to the console."
"2025-04-28 00:01";"### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes dynamically:

```python
class AddMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['add_method'] = lambda self, x: x + 5
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddMethodMeta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.add_method(10))  # Output?
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.

B) The output will be an error because `add_method` is not defined in `MyClass`.

C) The output will be `None` because metaclasses do not affect method definitions.

D) The code will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot add methods dynamically.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.**

This is the correct answer. In Python, metaclasses allow you to customize class creation by modifying or extending the class definition before it's finalized. In this case, the `AddMethodMeta` metaclass dynamically adds a method named `add_method` to any class it's applied to. When we create an instance of `MyClass`, it gains access to this new method, which simply returns its argument incremented by 5.

The line `print(obj.add_method(10))` will therefore output `15`."

Which of the following statements is true about this code? Select all correct answers:

A) The metaclass `Meta` checks if the subclass has a `greet` method before allowing it to be instantiated.
B) The `greeting_decorator` modifies the `greet` method of any class it decorates, adding a greeting message at the beginning.
C) When `person.greet()` is called, it will first print ""Hello from Person"" and then ""I am a person"".
D) Both A and B are correct.";"[ANSWER] D

Explanation:
A) The metaclass `Meta` correctly checks if the subclass has a `greet` method. If not, it raises a `TypeError`, which is true.
B) The `greeting_decorator` correctly modifies the `greet` method by adding a greeting message at the beginning, which is also true.

What is the expected output of this code? Why does it behave that way?

A) The output will be 1000 because all increments are performed atomically.

B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

C) The output will be more than 1000 due to extra increments caused by thread switching.

D) The program will raise an exception due to improper use of the lock.";"B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

Explanation:
- The decorator `@thread_safe` is intended to ensure that the `increment` method of `SharedResource` is thread-safe by using a lock.
- However, the lock object is created inside the wrapper function for each call. This means that each `increment` call will use its own separate lock instead of sharing the same one across threads.
- Since each thread uses its own lock and does not block other threads from reading and writing to `value`, race conditions can still occur.
- Therefore, the final value of `resource.value` will be less than 1000, as multiple increments might be incorrectly applied."

You are tasked with creating a Python application that needs to track the creation of all instances of a certain class. You decide to use a metaclass for this purpose. Here is a partially complete code snippet:

```python

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(InstanceTracker._instances)  # Expected output: {'MyClass': [obj1, obj2]}

Which line of code should be added to the `__new__` method in the `InstanceTracker` metaclass to track the creation of instances?

A) `cls._instances[name].append(instance)`
B) `self._instances[name] = []`
C) `self._instances[name].append(self())`
D) `self._instances[name].append(new_class())`";"[ANSWER] C

Explanation:
In the provided code, we need to track the creation of instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass. The current implementation does not add any logic to track instances. 

Option A is incorrect because `instance` is not defined in the scope where this line would be executed.
Option B is incorrect because it attempts to create a new list for each class but does not append any instances to it.
Option C is correct because it appends an instance of the newly created class to a list associated with the class name. The `self()` call inside `append` creates a new instance of the class, which is then added to the list stored in `_instances`.
Option D is incorrect because it tries to append the metaclass itself rather than an instance of the class.

Adding this line to the `__new__` method will correctly track and store instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass."

B) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. After that, the program will print nothing as the timer is not running any more tasks.

C) The coroutine starts and stays alive indefinitely because the timer keeps scheduling itself to run every 3 seconds.

D) There will be an error because adding a task to the `AsyncTimer` instance does not start it immediately.";"A) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. The timer runs in an infinite loop every 3 seconds, but since there's only one task, it doesn't add any complexity.

The `run` method of the `AsyncTimer` class is designed to run indefinitely, continuously waiting for all tasks to complete before sleeping for the specified interval. Since the `my_coroutine` is added with a sleep duration of 2 seconds, it will complete after 2 seconds and then wait again for the next iteration of the timer loop (every 3 seconds).

The correct answer is D. The metaclass `Meta` dynamically adds a new attribute to each integer attribute in the class, but it only affects attributes named with a single letter ('x', 'z'). This is because when the `Meta` metaclass iterates over all attributes, it includes inherited attributes as well. In this case, since 'y' is not an integer, no additional attribute is added for it. The '__new__' method of the metaclass is included in the class dictionary because metaclasses define their own `__new__` method to create and return a new class object."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) When `MyClass` is defined, it does not raise any errors.
B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.
C) The metaclass `Meta` can be used to enforce that all classes inheriting from `MyClass` must also define an attribute `x`.
D) The metaclass `Meta` cannot be instantiated directly.";"B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because the code does not run without errors. It raises a `TypeError` during class creation.
- Option C is incorrect because metaclasses like `Meta` control the creation of classes, not their inheritance.
- Option D is correct because a metaclass itself is just a class that inherits from `type`, and it can be instantiated as any other class.
- Option B is correct. The metaclass `Meta` checks if the attribute `x` is present in the class dictionary when the class is being created. If it's not, it raises a `TypeError`."

You are tasked with creating a context manager that logs the time taken for each block of code it decorates. However, you want this logging to be performed asynchronously, so that it does not block the main execution flow. Your task is to design such a context manager using Python's `asyncio` library.

Here's a partially implemented version of your context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f""Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds"")

# Example usage:
async def main():
    async with AsyncTimerContextManager() as timer:
        # Simulate some asynchronous work
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print(""Work completed!"")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

However, this code has an issue: it does not correctly handle exceptions that might occur within the `with` block. You need to ensure that any exceptions raised inside the `with` block are propagated and handled by the caller of `async with`.

What change should you make to the `AsyncTimerContextManager` class to correctly propagate exceptions?

A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

B) Wrap the code that calculates and logs the duration in a try-except block.

C) Remove the `return self` statement from the `__aenter__` method.

D) Change the `log_time_taken` method to be an instance method instead of a static method.";"A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

The correct answer is A. In the `__aexit__` method, you should add a condition to check if an exception occurred (`if exc_type`). If an exception did occur, you should re-raise it using `raise exc_val from exc_tb`. This ensures that any exceptions raised within the `with` block are propagated and handled correctly by the caller of `async with`.

Here's the corrected version of the context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        if exc_type is None:
            await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)
        else:
            raise exc_val from exc_tb

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f""Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds"")

# Example usage remains the same
```

This implementation ensures that exceptions are correctly propagated, allowing for proper error handling in the code using the context manager."

A) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", followed by ""Task 2 started"", then ""Task 1 finished"", and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

B) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 1 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

C) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", followed by ""Task 2 started"", and both tasks will finish concurrently without waiting for the other.

D) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 2 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, but ""Task 1 finished"" will not print because it takes longer to complete.";"B) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 1 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

Explanation: 
- The `asyncio.gather` function runs multiple coroutines concurrently.
- When both tasks start, they print their start messages immediately.
- However, since `task2` completes first (after 1 second), its completion is printed next.
- After a total of 2 seconds, the completion of `task1` is printed."

A) True  
B) False  
C) The code will raise an error  
D) None of the above";"**Answer:** A) True

**Explanation:**  
The provided metaclass, `SingletonMeta`, ensures that only one instance of any class using it can be created. In this case, when `db1` and `db2` are instantiated from the `Database` class, the `__call__` method of the metaclass is invoked. Since `_instances[cls]` is checked for `SingletonMeta`, and since no other instance exists in `_instances`, both `db1` and `db2` will reference the same instance stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`."

Which of the following statements is true about the `counter` decorator and the `my_function` when it's decorated?

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

B) The `wrapper` function does not have access to the `count` attribute because it is a local variable in the `counter` function.

C) Each call to `my_function` creates a new instance of the `counter` decorator.

D) When `my_function` is decorated, the `func.count` attribute is set to 1 immediately and then incremented by 1 each time the function is called.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

Explanation:
- A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it. In this case, the `counter` decorator is designed to keep track of how many times the decorated function (`my_function`) has been called.
- The `wrapper` function inside the `counter` decorator has access to all non-local variables, including those defined in enclosing functions. Therefore, it can modify the `count` attribute which was set on the original function object when it was passed to the decorator.
- Each call to `my_function()` increments the `count` by 1, demonstrating that the `func.count` attribute is indeed being updated correctly with each invocation.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

B) The use of `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` inside the wrapper function is incorrect and will raise an error.

C) The `@time_decorator` syntax applies the decorator to any synchronous or asynchronous function without modification.

D) The execution time measurement is accurate but can be improved by using a more precise timer.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

Explanation: The code uses `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` to get the current time asynchronously, which is appropriate for measuring the execution time of an asyncio function. This method ensures that the timing does not interfere with other tasks running in the event loop. The decorator works as intended and provides accurate execution time measurements for asynchronous functions."

What is the output when running this code?

A) The file 'example.txt' will be created with ""Hello, World!"" inside.
B) ""Executing open_file"" will be printed before the file is written to.
C) An error will occur because decorators cannot be used with context managers.
D) ""Executing open_file"" will not be printed.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The file 'example.txt' will be created with ""Hello, World!"" inside.

Explanation: Decorators and context managers are separate concepts in Python. While you can use a decorator on any callable, including a function used within a context manager, the decorators themselves do not interfere with the behavior of the context manager. In this example, `log_decorator` is applied to `open_file`, but since it does not modify the behavior of opening or closing the file (only logs that the function is being executed), the file operations will still occur as expected.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) The `my_decorator` will only execute before the `say_hello()` function, not when accessing the `my_property`.

Explanation:
In Python, decorators can be applied to methods in classes. However, when a property is accessed, it does not pass through the decorator because properties have their own getter, setter, and deleter methods associated with them. In this case, the `@property` decorator applies the `my_decorator` only to the getter method of `my_property`. Therefore, the message ""Something is happening before the function is called."" will be printed when accessing `obj.my_property`, but ""Something is happening after the function is called."" will not be printed because the decorator does not apply to the setter or deleter methods."

B) The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator wraps `my_async_function` in a way that it can be used with `asyncio.run()`.

**Explanation:**
The `@AsyncDecorator` class is designed to accept an asynchronous function (`my_async_function`) and simply call it. This does not change the fact that `my_async_function` is still an async function, meaning it requires proper execution through an event loop like `asyncio.run()`. Thus, using `@AsyncDecorator` does not alter the fundamental nature of `my_async_function`; it remains a coroutine, which can only be executed in an asyncio context. Therefore, calling `my_async_function()` directly outside of an async context or without wrapping it in an appropriate event loop will raise an error unless `my_async_function` is defined as a regular function rather than an async one."

You are tasked with optimizing a Python script that involves frequent I/O operations. The current implementation uses synchronous file handling, which is blocking and affects the performance of the application.

To optimize this, you decide to use asynchronous file handling with `asyncio`. However, your script also needs to maintain state across multiple asynchronous tasks without using global variables or mutable shared data structures.

Which of the following approaches would be most suitable for maintaining state between asynchronous tasks while optimizing I/O operations?

A) Using a class-based state management system that inherits from `asyncio.Lock` and handles all state transitions asynchronously

B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup

C) Implementing a custom metaclass that tracks state across asynchronous tasks by intercepting attribute access and modification

D) Creating a global dictionary to store state information, which is thread-safe due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup**

This approach is the most suitable for several reasons:
1. **State Management**: `AsyncExitStack` allows you to manage multiple asynchronous context managers efficiently, ensuring that resources are cleaned up properly even if an exception occurs.
2. **Concurrency Safety**: By using `asyncio.Queue`, you can safely share state across tasks without worrying about race conditions or synchronization issues, making the system more robust and scalable.
3. **Asynchronous Operations**: Since both `AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` are asynchronous constructs, they integrate seamlessly with other asynchronous components of your application, improving overall performance and responsiveness.

The other options have limitations:
- **Option A** uses `asyncio.Lock`, which is more for synchronization rather than state management.
- **Option C**, while it might be interesting, introduces unnecessary complexity and potential issues related to maintaining state in a metaclass, especially since metaclasses are not directly designed for this purpose.
- **Option D** relies on the GIL, which would limit performance gains from asynchronous programming, as it doesn't take advantage of multiple cores or threads effectively."

Which of the following is the correct diagnosis for why `MyClass` instances do not log method calls as expected?

A) The metaclass's `__new__` method is incorrectly overriding the class dictionary.

B) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.

C) Using `setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))` modifies the class dictionary in an unintended way.

D) The `wrapper` function inside `log_method` is incorrectly capturing its arguments.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.

The issue with the provided code is that the `log_method` static method is intended to return a new callable that logs when the wrapped method is called. However, it incorrectly modifies the `wrapper` function's closure by using `*args, **kwargs`, which prevents it from capturing the correct arguments and keyword arguments of the original method.

To fix this, one should avoid modifying the `wrapper` function in-place within `log_method`. A better approach would be to define a new callable object that captures the original method and its signature correctly. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f""Creating class {name}"")
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():

                setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

A) The `__len__` method will return 0 because it does not count attributes.

B) The `__len__` method will raise an error because it cannot determine attribute counts dynamically.

C) The `__len__` method will return 2 because it correctly counts the instance attributes.

D) The behavior of the `MyClass` instances will be unchanged as no additional methods were added.

### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct answer: C) The `__len__` method will return 2 because it correctly counts the instance attributes.**

**Explanation:** The metaclass `AutoLenMeta` dynamically adds a `__len__` method to any class it decorates. This method returns the number of items in the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which typically includes all non-private attributes of the class (i.e., those not starting with an underscore). Therefore, when `MyClass` is created, the `__len__` method will return 2, as there are two attributes (`a` and `b`) in the `MyClass`. The lambda function used for `__len__` counts all items directly from the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which correctly reflects the number of instance attributes.";"Answer format error.

B) Method '__init__' called with args: (), kwargs: {}  
   38

C) Method '__init__' called with args: (10, 20), kwargs: {}  
   Method 'add' called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}

D) Error: __new__() got multiple values for argument 'name'

**Part 2 (Answer):**
C) Method '__init__' called with args: (10, 20), kwargs: {}  
   Method 'add' called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}  
   40

**Explanation:** 
When `MyClass` is instantiated, the metaclass `LogMethodCalls` logs the call to the `__init__` method before executing it. After `__init__` is called, when `obj.add(5, 3)` is executed, the `add` method is also logged by the `LogMethodCalls` metaclass. The expected output includes both the log statements and the result of the `add` method call, which is 40."

print(instance1 == instance2)  # Output: ?
print(instance1.value)       # Output: ?

What will be the output of `instance1 == instance2` and `instance1.value` when the code is executed?

A. True, 10  
B. False, 10  
C. True, 20  
D. False, 20";"A. True, 10  

Explanation: The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created, no matter how many times it is instantiated. When `instance1 = create_instance(10)` is executed, an instance with `value=10` is created and stored in `_instances`. Then, when `instance2 = create_instance(20)` is called, the existing instance from `_instances` (which has `value=10`) is returned. Therefore, `instance1 == instance2` evaluates to True because they refer to the same object. Additionally, since both instances are the same, `instance1.value` also returns 10."

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to modify the behavior of a class method:

```python
from functools import wraps

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):

# Create an instance of MyClass and call its method
obj = MyClass(10)

What will be the output of this code when executed? Explain how decorators work in this context.

A) ""Calling get_value with args=(), kwargs={}

""10""

C) TypeError: get_value() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'

D) None";"A) ""Calling get_value with args=(), kwargs={}

Explanation: In this example, a decorator named `log_method_calls` is defined to log the calls to methods it decorates. The `wrapper` function inside the decorator logs the method name and its arguments before calling the original method. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and the `get_value` method is called, the output shows that the method was successfully logged with no arguments passed (as `self` is automatically passed by Python when a method is called on an instance), followed by the return value of the method call."

C) The tasks run concurrently, and all three finish within about 3 seconds.

Explanation:
The `asyncio.gather` function is used to run multiple coroutines concurrently. In this example, 'A', 'B', and 'C' start at the same time, and each task has a different sleep duration. Task 'A' sleeps for 1 second, 'B' for 2 seconds, and 'C' for 3 seconds.

Implement a decorator that measures the execution time of a coroutine. The decorator should be able to handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions. Use `asyncio` for asynchronous timing.

Here is a partial implementation to help you get started:

    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()

sync_function = measure_time(lambda: time.sleep(1))

# Call both the synchronous and asynchronous functions to see their execution times.
sync_function()
asyncio.run(async_function())

Which of the following statements is true regarding the implementation above?

A) The `measure_time` decorator works correctly for both synchronous and asynchronous functions but it fails when applied to synchronous functions.

B) The `measure_time` decorator is fully functional for both types of functions and will accurately measure their execution times.

C) The `wrapper` function in the decorator incorrectly measures time due to a mistake in capturing start and end times.

D) The `async_function` can be called directly without using `await`, but it will not trigger the execution time measurement because of its `@measure_time` decorator.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
B) The `measure_time` decorator is fully functional for both types of functions and will accurately measure their execution times.

The implementation uses `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` to capture the current loop time, which works correctly whether the function being measured is synchronous or asynchronous. For synchronous functions, calling `await asyncio.sleep(1)` in a coroutine context effectively pauses the event loop for 1 second while still allowing other tasks to run, thus accurately measuring the execution time.";"Answer format error.

D) The use of `@wraps(cls)` in the decorator is unnecessary and causing issues.

Part 2 (Answer):
B) Both the metaclass and the decorator are incorrectly trying to manage instances.

Explanation:
The issue with the provided code lies in its attempt to combine singleton patterns using both a metaclass (`SingletonMeta`) and a decorator (`singleton`). Each of these methods tries to manage the instance creation, leading to conflicts when an instance is created through one method (metaclass) and later attempted again through another (decorator). The correct approach would be to use either the metaclass or the decorator but not both. If using a metaclass, it should handle all instance creation logic within its `__call__` method. If using a decorator, it should manage instances outside of class definitions and apply it to methods that need to return singleton instances rather than applying it directly to the class.";"Answer format error.

A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.

B) The decorator uses a closure to capture and modify the behavior of the original function.

C) The `wrapper` function inside the `timer` decorator directly replaces `compute_sum`.

D) The execution time is printed only once, outside of the function call in `compute_sum`.";"A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.

**Explanation:** 
Option A is correct. In Python, decorators are functions that take another function and extend its behavior without explicitly modifying it. The `wrapper` function captures the execution time by recording the start and end times around the call to the original function `func`. This extended behavior is then returned when `compute_sum` is called.

**Option B:**
While the decorator does use a closure, this is not what makes it modify the original function. A closure only affects how variables are bound within nested functions. The modification happens through the way the `wrapper` function is defined and returned by the `timer` decorator.

**Option C:**
This statement is incorrect because the `wrapper` function does not replace `compute_sum`. Instead, it wraps around `compute_sum` to add the timing functionality.

**Option D:**
The execution time is printed inside the `wrapper` function each time `compute_sum` is called. It is not a one-time print outside of the function call."

Explanation: The correct answer is B. The metaclass `AutoReprMeta` dynamically adds a `__repr__` method to any class it decorates, which in this case is `MyClass`. This method returns a string formatted as ""ClassName(instance_id)"", where `instance_id` is the memory address of the instance, as returned by Python's built-in `id()` function.

D) The decorator will cause a stack overflow due to excessive recursion when used with large inputs.

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]  
**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When applied to `compute_sum`, the decorator will print the execution time without modifying its return value.

Explanation: The provided decorator, `timing_decorator`, is correctly implemented. It measures the time taken by the function it decorates (`func`) and prints this duration. However, it does not modify the return value of the function being decorated. Therefore, when `compute_sum(100000)` is called with the `@timing_decorator` applied, it will print the execution time and then return the result of `sum(range(1))`, which is 5000050000, as expected.

The decorator can be used with coroutine functions without issues. However, in Python, decorators are not directly applicable to coroutines due to differences in how they are executed and awaited, so attempting to use a timing decorator on a coroutine would not raise an error but would likely not function as intended.

**Explanation:**  
The decorator `async_if_docstring_contains_async` checks if the docstring of a function contains the word ""async"". If it does, the function is decorated with `asyncio.coroutine`, which converts it into an asynchronous function. In the given code, the subclass `Derived` inherits from `Base`. Since `method_with_async_in_docstring` has a docstring containing ""async"", it will be converted to an asynchronous method when it is accessed via an instance of `Derived`. On the other hand, `method_without_async_in_docstring`, even though it's defined as an async method in the class definition, does not have the required word ""async"" in its docstring.

# What will be the result of calling `create_instance()`?
A) True
B) False
C) TypeError
D) SyntaxError";"A) True

Explanation: 
The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can ever be created. When you call `create_instance()`, it attempts to create two instances of `MyClass`. Due to the singleton pattern enforced by the metaclass, both `obj1` and `obj2` will refer to the same object in memory, making the comparison `obj1 is obj2` evaluate to `True`."

A) ""Class MyClass is being created"" will be printed, and then a TypeError will occur because `MyClass` cannot be used as a context manager.
B) ""Class MyClass is being created"" will be printed, and then an instance of `MyClass` will be created without any errors.
C) A NameError will occur because the `with` statement requires an object that implements the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
D) The code will not run as there is a syntax error in defining the `Meta` metaclass.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A) ""Class MyClass is being created"" will be printed, and then a TypeError will occur because `MyClass` cannot be used as a context manager.

Explanation: The `with` statement requires that the object passed to it implements the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. Since `Meta` does not define these methods, attempting to use `MyClass` with a `with` statement results in a TypeError even though the metaclass logs the creation of the class as intended."

A) The `Timer` class will always print a timing that is exactly the same as what `timed_function` prints.

B) Both `timed_function` and `Timer` are decorators, but they can be used interchangeably.

C) The `Timer` context manager will provide more precise timing than the `timed_function`.

D) The `timed_function` decorator is applied to the function inside the `with Timer()` block.

### Part 2 (Answer)
**";"C) The `Timer` context manager will provide more precise timing than the `timed_function`.**

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Option A:** Incorrect. While both decorators and context managers can be used for timing, the `Timer` class provides more precision due to its use of the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, which are called at the exact start and end of the block respectively.
  
- **Option B:** Correct. Both `timed_function` and `Timer` can be used as decorators, but they serve different purposes. The decorator is useful for adding functionality to existing functions without changing their interface, while the context manager provides a way to manage resources (like file handles or timers) in a more controlled manner.
  
- **Option C:** Correct. The `Timer` class offers more precision because it measures the time between the exact entry and exit of the block where it is used. This eliminates any overhead that might be incurred by function calls, providing a more accurate timing.

- **Option D:** Incorrect. The `timed_function` decorator is applied to the `long_running_task` function before entering the context manager block with `Timer()`. Thus, the decorator's timing will include the time spent both inside and outside the `with Timer()` block."

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `log_decorator` will not be applied to any methods.

B) The `enter` and `exit` methods will be logged before and after their execution.

C) The `ContextManager` class must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods for the context manager to work correctly.

D) There will be a runtime error because `Meta` does not properly delegate the implementation of `__enter__` and `__exit__`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The `ContextManager` class must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods for the context manager to work correctly.

The correct answer is C. Here's why:

- In the provided code, the `Meta` metaclass checks if `enter` and `exit` methods are defined in any subclass of `ContextManager`. If they are, it replaces them with decorated versions using `log_decorator`.
- For a class to be usable as a context manager, it must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. The `Meta` metaclass ensures that these methods are present before replacing them with the decorated versions.
- If the subclass does not define either method, they will remain unmodified, but the context manager will still be valid as long as other necessary methods (like `__init__`) are implemented.

Options A, B, and D are incorrect:
- A is wrong because `log_decorator` is applied to both the original `enter` and `exit` methods.
- B is not entirely correct because the decorator only logs the method calls if they exist in the subclass. If either `enter` or `exit` is missing, it won't be logged.
- D is incorrect because there is no issue with how `Meta` handles the methods; it correctly checks and decorates them if present."
"2025-05-12 00:02";"";"**Part 1 (Question):**
Implement a metaclass that allows only one instance of any class it decorates. This metaclass should also ensure that attempting to create another instance results in raising an exception with the message ""Only one instance allowed"". Use this metaclass on a simple class `Singleton`.

```python
# Your code here

class Singleton:
    pass

# Example usage:
instance1 = Singleton()
print(instance1)  # Should print the singleton instance

try:
    instance2 = Singleton()  # This should raise an exception

        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Example usage remains the same
```

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The correct implementation is option B. This metaclass uses a class variable `_instance` to store the instance of the class when it is first created. Any subsequent attempts to create an instance will return this stored instance, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists.

Option A and D are essentially the same, storing all instances in a dictionary `_instances`, which could lead to issues if multiple different classes use this metaclass. Option C incorrectly tries to modify the class definition during creation using `__new__`, which is not necessary for this functionality."

What does the code do when executed? What are the expected outputs?

A) The program creates two instances of `MyClass`, each with a delay of 1 and 2 seconds respectively. It then prints the values and counts.

B) The program creates one instance of `MyClass` and prints its value twice, followed by the count of instances.

C) An error occurs because async methods cannot be added to classes using metaclasses.

D) The program crashes due to a misuse of asyncio.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

A) The program creates two instances of `MyClass`, each with a delay of 1 and 2 seconds respectively. It then prints the values and counts.

**Explanation:** 
The metaclass `Meta` is used to add an instance counter to the class, which increments every time a new instance of `MyClass` is created. The async method `async_method` is dynamically added to `MyClass` using the `__get__` method of the coroutine function to bind it correctly to the class methods. When run, the program creates two instances of `MyClass`, and each prints its value after a delay followed by the total count of instances created."

Which of the following statements correctly describes how and why this metaclass works?

A) The metaclass dynamically defines a new method `hello_world` during class creation.

B) The `__new__` method is overridden to manually add the method to each instance.

C) The metaclass uses a decorator to modify the class after it's created.

D) The `hello_world` method is added to instances of `MyClass`, not to the class itself.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The metaclass dynamically defines a new method `hello_world` during class creation.

Explanation: In Python, metaclasses are essentially classes that create other classes. When a class is defined using a metaclass, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called with the class name, base classes, and class dictionary as arguments. Inside this method, we can modify or extend the class dictionary to include additional methods, attributes, or even dynamically define new methods. In this case, the `Meta` metaclass adds a lambda function named `hello_world` that prints ""Hello, World!"" whenever it is called.

The other options are incorrect:
- B) The method is added directly to the class itself through the metaclass.
- C) This refers to decorators, which modify functions or methods after they are defined, not during class creation.
- D) The method is added to the class, not instances of the class."

You are tasked with creating a decorator that can be used to measure the execution time of any function it decorates. The decorator should handle asynchronous functions as well as synchronous ones. However, you've encountered an issue: when applying the decorator to an async function, it doesn't work correctly due to the way decorators are typically applied.

Here's a code snippet that attempts to create such a decorator:

```python
import time

def measure_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

The code does not work as expected for an async function. Modify the `measure_time` decorator so that it can handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly.

A) Provide a solution that works for both types of functions.
B) Explain why the original implementation fails for async functions.
C) Suggest a way to modify the decorator to accommodate both cases without significantly altering its structure.";"[A] The modified `measure_time` decorator should use Python's `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` to check if the decorated function is an async function. If it is, the decorator should measure time differently by using `await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(None, func)` inside a coroutine.

[B] The original implementation fails for async functions because it calls the function directly without awaiting it when it's an async function. This leads to the measurement starting before the function actually starts running and ending before it finishes, resulting in incorrect timing.

[C] To accommodate both synchronous and asynchronous functions, the decorator can be modified to check if the wrapped function is an async function using `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)`. If it is, the decorator should measure time by awaiting the function inside a coroutine. Otherwise, it should proceed as before:

```python
import asyncio
import time

def measure_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func):

You are tasked with creating a decorator that measures the execution time of a function, but this time you want to ensure that it is only applied to functions within specific classes. To achieve this, you decide to use both decorators and metaclasses.

Here's your starting point:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimeMeasuringMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith(""__""):
                dct[attr_name] = timing_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class TimeMeasuringClass(metaclass=TimeMeasuringMeta):
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(1.0)

# Example usage:
tm = TimeMeasuringClass()
tm.method1()  # Should print execution time
tm.method2()  # Should print execution time
```

You want to ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods of classes defined with `TimeMeasuringMeta`. However, you also notice that applying decorators directly to method definitions within a class might not be as clean or flexible as using metaclasses. Your task is to modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass so that it applies the `timing_decorator` only to methods where the decorator is explicitly specified.

**Question:** How can you modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass to ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods where it is explicitly specified, such as by using a custom attribute or annotation?

A) By checking for a specific attribute or annotation on each method during the metaclass's `__new__` method
B) By dynamically adding the decorator to methods at runtime within the class definition
C) By overriding the `__getattribute__` method of the metaclass to apply the decorator conditionally
D) By using a custom decorator that checks for its application within the metaclass";"[ANSWER]
A) By checking for a specific attribute or annotation on each method during the metaclass's `__new__` method

Explanation:
To ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods where it is explicitly specified, you can modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass by adding logic in its `__new__` method to check for a specific attribute or annotation on each method. If this attribute or annotation is present, apply the decorator; otherwise, leave the method unchanged. This approach allows for fine-grained control over which methods are decorated and can be easily extended to accommodate different ways of specifying that a method should be timed."

You are tasked with creating a Python decorator that can be applied to both functions and class methods. The decorator should log the function call details including the arguments passed, but it should handle both regular functions and static/class methods correctly. Implement this decorator and demonstrate its usage on a sample function and a class method.

```python
# Decorator implementation

    return a + b

# Example usage of the decorator on a class method

    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y

# Test cases
result_add = add(3, 4)
print(result_add)  # Output should be 7 with logged call details

calc = Calculator()
result_multiply = calc.multiply(5, 6)
print(result_multiply)  # Output should be 30 with logged call details
```

### Part 2 (Answer)
**";"A**

**Detailed Explanation:** 
The correct answer involves creating a decorator that can handle both regular functions and static/class methods. This requires using the `functools.wraps` to preserve the original function's metadata and checking if the wrapped method is an instance method, class method, or static method.

Here is a possible implementation of the `log_calls` decorator:

```python
import functools

def log_calls(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if inspect.ismethod(wrapper) and not isinstance(wrapper, staticmethod):
            instance = args[0]
            method_name = func.__name__
            args = args[1:]
        else:
            instance = None
            method_name = func.__qualname__
        
        print(f""Calling {method_name} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f""{method_name} returned {result}"")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Example usage of the decorator on a function
@log_calls
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example usage of the decorator on a class method
class Calculator:
    @staticmethod
    @log_calls
    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y

# Test cases
result_add = add(3, 4)
print(result_add)  # Output should be 7 with logged call details

calc = Calculator()
result_multiply = calc.multiply(5, 6)
print(result_multiply)  # Output should be 30 with logged call details
```

This implementation uses `inspect.ismethod` to differentiate between instance methods and static/class methods. For instance methods, it adjusts the arguments list by removing the first argument which is the instance itself.

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import threading

def thread_safe(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with threading.Lock():
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1

    def get_value(self):
        return self.value

def main():
    counter = Counter()
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=counter.increment) for _ in range(100)]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

    print(counter.get_value())

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and implications of this code?

A) The `Counter` class is thread-safe without using any decorators or locks.
B) The `thread_safe` decorator ensures that the `increment` method can be safely called from multiple threads, but it does not protect other methods like `get_value`.
C) The use of threading in this code guarantees that the counter will always display a value of 100.
D) The `Counter` class will raise an exception due to concurrent access issues.

### Part 2 (Answer)
B) The `thread_safe` decorator ensures that the `increment` method can be safely called from multiple threads, but it does not protect other methods like `get_value`.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- The `thread_safe` decorator is applied to the `Counter` class to ensure thread safety. It wraps each method in a lock context manager, which means that only one thread can execute any of the wrapped methods at a time.
  
- However, this protection does not extend to other methods like `get_value`. If another method were to access or modify the state without using the lock, it could lead to race conditions even though `increment` is protected.

- In the given code, each thread calls `increment`, which is protected by the lock. Since no other threads can call `increment` at the same time, there will be no data corruption for incrementing the counter. However, calling `get_value` from multiple threads simultaneously could lead to race conditions unless additional synchronization measures are taken.

- Therefore, option B accurately describes that while the `thread_safe` decorator makes `increment` thread-safe, it does not cover all methods in the `Counter` class.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a singleton pattern using metaclasses:

        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

# Example usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Should print True
print(obj1.value)
```

Which of the following statements about this code is incorrect?

A. The `SingletonMeta` metaclass correctly implements the singleton pattern.
B. Instances of `MyClass` are created only once, ensuring that `obj1` and `obj2` refer to the same object.
C. The `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` checks if an instance already exists before creating a new one.
D. The `value` attribute is correctly set for both `obj1` and `obj2`.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A. The statement ""The `SingletonMeta` metaclass correctly implements the singleton pattern"" is incorrect.

Explanation: While `SingletonMeta` does ensure that only one instance of `MyClass` is created, it uses a class-level dictionary `_instances` to store instances. This approach might not be thread-safe in a multi-threaded environment where multiple threads could potentially create instances simultaneously before any have been added to the dictionary. A more robust solution would involve using threading locks or atomic operations to ensure thread safety when checking and setting `_instances`."

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The decorator `log_resource_access` ensures that the `access_database` function can only be called once.

B) When `access_database` is decorated with `@log_resource_access`, it logs entering and exiting the function, and then executes the actual database access logic.

C) The decorator `log_resource_access` will cause a syntax error when applied to any function.

D) Calling `access_database()` will not output any messages because the decorator does nothing.";"### Answer:
B) When `access_database` is decorated with `@log_resource_access`, it logs entering and exiting the function, and then executes the actual database access logic.

**Explanation:**
- The decorator `log_resource_access` wraps the original `access_database` function to add logging functionality before and after its execution.
- Inside the `wrapper` function, the message ""Entering {func.__name__}"" is printed when entering the function, followed by the execution of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, which performs the actual database access. Afterward, the message ""Exiting {func.__name__}"" is printed to indicate that the function has exited.
- This allows for monitoring and debugging purposes without modifying the original function logic."

C) The `Timer` class accurately measures the time taken by both synchronous and asynchronous operations within its `async with` block.
D) The `Timer` class is not thread-safe.";"[ANSWER] C) The `Timer` class accurately measures the time taken by both synchronous and asynchronous operations within its `async with` block.

**Explanation:**
- The `Timer` class uses Python's `asyncio.sleep()` in its `main()` function, which is an asynchronous operation. 
- The `Timer` class defines both `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods, making it a context manager that works with the `async with` statement.
- When using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`, Python's event loop is not blocked, allowing other tasks to run concurrently. This demonstrates that the `Timer` class can accurately measure both synchronous (like time.sleep) and asynchronous operations.
- The example correctly shows how to use an asynchronous context manager (`async with`) with a function that involves asynchronous sleep, making option C the correct answer."

A) The `log_arguments` decorator correctly logs both positional and keyword arguments for any method it decorates.

B) When `add(2, 3)` is called on an instance of `Calculator`, it will print ""Arguments: (2, 3), Keyword Arguments: {}"" before returning the result of the addition.

C) The `wrapper` function in the decorator replaces the original method's signature, leading to potential issues when the method's signature needs to be preserved.

D) The `log_arguments` decorator can be used on any method that does not require access to the instance (`self`) or class (`cls`) of the object it is called on.";"B) When `add(2, 3)` is called on an instance of `Calculator`, it will print ""Arguments: (2, 3), Keyword Arguments: {}"" before returning the result of the addition.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because while the decorator correctly logs positional arguments, it does not log keyword arguments when they are provided.
- Option C is partially correct but misleading. The `wrapper` function does not replace the original method's signature; instead, it simply adds logging functionality around the method call without altering its interface.
- Option D is incorrect because if a method is decorated with `log_arguments`, it will receive an additional positional argument (`self`) when called as a class method, which might cause errors or unexpected behavior unless explicitly handled in the decorator."

B) All `fetch_data` calls are made sequentially, waiting for each to complete before starting the next.
C) The use of `asyncio.gather` allows all `fetch_data` calls to run concurrently, significantly speeding up the fetching process.
D) There is no error handling mechanism in place if a URL fails to fetch data.";"[ANSWER]
C) The use of `asyncio.gather` allows all `fetch_data` calls to run concurrently, significantly speeding up the fetching process.

Explanation:
- **Option A and B** are incorrect because the code uses `asyncio.gather`, which runs all tasks concurrently. Each task (each call to `fetch_data`) is scheduled and started immediately after the previous one, but they don't wait for each other. Therefore, multiple URLs' data can be fetched at the same time.
- **Option C** is correct as `asyncio.gather` takes an iterable of coroutines (`tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in self.urls]`) and schedules them to run concurrently. This results in all `fetch_data` calls starting almost immediately and finishing in parallel, which can significantly reduce the total time needed to fetch data from multiple URLs.
- **Option D** is not addressed in the provided code. While it's generally a good practice to include error handling when dealing with network requests or external services, this specific question does not touch upon that aspect of the code."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `WebServer` class can be instantiated and its methods called directly without any issues.

B) Calling `asyncio.run(web_server.start())` will cause a runtime error because `web_server.start()` is an async method and should not be awaited directly inside `run_server`.

C) The server listens on the specified host and port, handles client connections asynchronously, and echoes back the received data in uppercase.

D) None of the above";"C) The server listens on the specified host and port, handles client connections asynchronously, and echoes back the received data in uppercase.

Explanation:
- The `WebServer` class is properly defined with an asynchronous method `handle_request` to handle incoming client requests.
- The `start` method sets up and starts the asyncio server, which correctly awaits the `serve_forever()` call.
- When `asyncio.run(web_server.start())` is called in `run_server`, it executes the async function as expected, without awaiting it directly inside another async function or coroutine. This is valid because `asyncio.run()` takes care of running the main entry point for asyncio programs.

B) The `get_data()` function will run synchronously and block the event loop.

C) The `@FetchDecorator` measures the time taken by `fetch_data()` and prints it out.

D) The `@FetchDecorator` is designed to work with synchronous functions only.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**C) The @FetchDecorator measures the time taken by fetch_data() and prints it out.**

Explanation:

The provided code defines a coroutine `get_data()` that uses another coroutine `fetch_data()`. The decorator `FetchDecorator` is applied to `get_data()`, which adds timing functionality around its execution.

When `get_data()` is called, it wraps the call to `fetch_data()` with timing logic. Inside the `__call__` method of the decorator, the start time is recorded before calling the decorated function (`self.func`). After the function returns, the end time is recorded, and the difference (time taken) is printed out.

This allows you to measure and print how long it takes for `fetch_data()` to execute, which demonstrates that the decorator works correctly with asynchronous functions."

B) The `attribute` starts at 1 and is incremented every time `increment()` is called.

C) The `attribute` is incremented correctly on the first call to `increment()`, but subsequent calls have no effect.

D) The code does not compile because it attempts to modify a class attribute inside a metaclass method.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `attribute` is incremented every time `increment()` is called, but it will always start from 0 for each new instance.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` sets the default value of `attribute` to 0 when the class is initialized.
- The decorator `modify_attribute` increments the `attribute` by 1 each time the decorated method `increment()` is called.
- Since `attribute` is a class attribute, it is shared among all instances of the class. However, in this specific code structure, it behaves as if it were incremented only once per instance because the increment happens every time an instance calls its own `increment()` method, not the original implementation in the metaclass."

D) There is no issue with the current implementation; it correctly measures the execution time of async functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The `wrapper` function does not properly handle exceptions raised by the decorated async function.

Explanation:
In the provided code, if an exception occurs within the `my_async_function`, it will not be caught and propagated. To fix this, the `wrapper` function should be modified to catch exceptions and re-raise them after printing the execution time. Here's how you can correct it:

try:
    loop.run_until_complete(my_async_function())
except Exception as e:

Imagine you are developing a library that needs to manage resources efficiently. You decide to create a context manager that automatically handles the opening and closing of files, but also ensures that each file is only opened once even if multiple parts of your code attempt to open it simultaneously.

Here's an example implementation using a context manager:

```python
class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
        self.file = None

    async def open(self):
        if not self.file:

    async def read(self):
        if self.file:
            return await self.file.read()
        else:
            raise IOError(""File is not opened"")

    async def close(self):
        if self.file:
            await self.file.close()
            self.file = None

async def manage_file(filename):

    finally:
        await manager.close()
```

However, you notice that this approach is not thread-safe because multiple threads could potentially attempt to open the same file simultaneously. To fix this, you decide to use a decorator to ensure that only one thread can execute the `open` method at a time.

Here's your task:  
1. Implement a thread-safe version of the `FileManager` class using a decorator.
2. Explain how this solution ensures thread safety and why it is effective.";"[A] The solution uses the `threading.Lock()` to ensure that only one thread can execute the `open` method at a time, making it thread-safe. This is effective because it prevents multiple threads from opening and closing the file simultaneously, which could lead to data corruption or other issues.

[B] The decorator ensures that each file is only opened once by using a class variable to track whether the file has already been opened. However, this approach does not ensure true thread safety because it relies on shared state without proper synchronization mechanisms.

[C] The solution uses `asyncio.Lock()` instead of `threading.Lock()`, making it suitable for asynchronous operations. While this is a step in the right direction, it still lacks proper synchronization across threads and processes, thus not ensuring true thread safety.

[D] The implementation does not require any changes because the original code already ensures thread safety by checking if the file is open before attempting to close it.

What will be the output of the above code when run? Explain why.

A) 0, 0
B) 1, 1
C) 2, 1
D) 1, 2";"Answer: C) 2, 1

Explanation:
The `call_count` decorator is designed to count how many times a method is called. However, the issue lies in how decorators are applied and shared across class methods. In Python, when you apply a decorator to multiple methods of a class using direct assignment like `FunctionCounter.method1 = call_count(FunctionCounter.method1)`, the decorator's state (in this case, `call_count`) is not preserved or shared between these methods.

In the provided code:
- The first two method calls (`fc.method1()` twice) correctly increment the `call_count` for `method1`.
- The third method call (`fc.method2()`) does not affect `method1`'s count because it was already assigned a different state with its own separate `call_count`.

Thus, `FunctionCounter.method1.call_count` remains 2 (since it was only incremented twice), and `FunctionCounter.method2.call_count` is still 0 (as it was never called)."

**Question:** Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a class decorator which measures and prints the execution time of any method in the decorated class. The goal is to enhance each method's functionality without modifying its implementation.

```python
import time

def measure_time(cls):
    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(value):
            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))
    return cls

def _time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f""Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@measure_time
class ExampleClass:
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(1)
```

**Question:** What is the issue with this implementation of the `measure_time` decorator, and how might you fix it to ensure that the original method behavior remains intact?

A) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.

B) The decorator modifies the class in-place which could cause issues if multiple instances are created.

C) The `wrapper` function is not capturing the correct reference of the original method.

D) The `measure_time` decorator should be a metaclass instead of a class decorator to avoid modifying the class directly.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer:** A) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.

**Explanation:** The current implementation assumes that all attributes in the class dictionary are callable methods, but it fails to distinguish between static methods and instance methods. When a method is called on an instance, Python first checks if it exists in the instance's `__dict__`, then in its class. Since the decorator replaces all callables with wrappers, it mistakenly tries to wrap static methods as well, leading to errors.

To fix this, you need to ensure that only instance methods are wrapped. Here is a corrected version of the `measure_time` decorator:

```python
import time

def measure_time(cls):
    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(value) and not isinstance(value, staticmethod):
            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))
    return cls

def _time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f""Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@measure_time
class ExampleClass:
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    @staticmethod
    def method2():
        time.sleep(1)
```

In this corrected version, the decorator checks if the callable is not a staticmethod using `isinstance(value, staticmethod)` before wrapping it, ensuring that only instance methods are modified."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

        print(""Connecting to the database..."")

# Usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1 is db2)  # What will this print?
```

What does the code above print when `db1` and `db2` are compared using the `is` operator?

A) False  
B) True  
C) An error  
D) The message ""Connecting to the database..."" twice";"B) True

Explanation: In the provided code, both `db1` and `db2` will refer to the same instance of the `DatabaseConnection` class because of the singleton pattern implemented through both a metaclass (`Singleton`) and a decorator (`singleton`). The `metaclass=Singleton` ensures that only one instance of any class decorated with this metaclass can be created. Thus, when `db1 = DatabaseConnection()` and `db2 = DatabaseConnection()`, `db1 is db2` evaluates to True because they both reference the same object."

Which statement is true regarding the above code?

A) The `Timer` class is a metaclass and does not support context management.

B) The `timed_function` decorator measures the execution time of any function it decorates.

C) Using `@timed_function`, the execution time of `compute_sum(1000000)` will be printed before its result.

D) The `Timer` class uses a descriptor for its context management functionality.";"[ANSWER]
B) The `timed_function` decorator measures the execution time of any function it decorates.

Explanation:
- The `Timer` class is not a metaclass but a simple context manager that prints the time taken by the block of code inside its `with` statement.
- The `timed_function` decorator correctly wraps any function to measure and print its execution time. It uses Python's built-in timing functions from the `time` module to calculate the duration and prints it after the decorated function completes.
- The `Timer` class indeed supports context management using the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, which are used in the example with the `with Timer('compute_sum'):` statement.
- Descriptors are not involved in the implementation of context management or decorators as shown in this code."

"2025-05-20 16:01";"";"**Part 1: Question**

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class with a custom attribute:

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['custom_attr'] = 'Hello, World!'

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Instantiate the class and access the custom attribute
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.custom_attr)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) `MyClass` will not have a `custom_attr` attribute because metaclasses are used for defining classes, not instances.

B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will inherit from the metaclass and automatically get the `custom_attr` attribute with the value 'Hello, World!'.

C) The `Meta` metaclass can only be used to add attributes to a class if it is specified when the class is defined.

D) Accessing `obj.custom_attr` will raise an AttributeError because `MyClass` does not define any attributes.

**Part 2: Answer**

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- Option A is incorrect. The metaclass `Meta` successfully adds a custom attribute `custom_attr` to the class `MyClass`. When you instantiate `MyClass`, this attribute is available.
- Option B is correct. The `__new__` method of the metaclass `Meta` is called when `MyClass` is defined, not when an instance of it is created. It adds a new attribute `custom_attr` to the class dictionary before the class is finalized.
- Option C is incorrect. A metaclass can be used to add attributes to any class that uses it, regardless of how often or where it is specified.
- Option D is incorrect. Since `custom_attr` is added by the metaclass, it will be accessible on instances of `MyClass`."
"2025-05-21 00:01";"[QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern. A singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

```python

        if cls not in cls._instances:

What will be the output of the `use_database` function when it is called?

A) Both `db1` and `db2` are new instances, so their identities are different.
B) Both `db1` and `db2` refer to the same instance, so their identities are the same.
C) An error will be raised because metaclasses cannot be used with singletons.
D) The output is unpredictable due to issues with garbage collection.";"B) Both `db1` and `db2` refer to the same instance, so their identities are the same.

Explanation:
The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of the `Database` class is created. When `use_database` is called, it attempts to create two instances (`db1` and `db2`). However, because of the singleton pattern enforced by the metaclass, both variables end up referencing the same instance, as stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`, indicating that they are indeed the same object."

**Question:** Consider the following Python code that aims to create a simple rate limiter decorator. The goal is to ensure that a function can only be called once every `interval` seconds. However, the implementation has an issue.

```python

        last_call_time = 0

    print(""Function is called"")

# Example usage:
my_function()  # Calls the function normally
time.sleep(0.5)
my_function()  # Should wait for 0.5 seconds before calling again
```

Which of the following statements correctly identifies a problem with this implementation?

A) The `rate_limit` decorator does not properly handle the case when multiple instances of `my_function` are called concurrently.

B) The use of a nonlocal variable inside the wrapper function can lead to memory leaks under certain conditions.

C) The sleep time calculation in the wrapper is incorrect, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.

D) The `last_call_time` variable is not thread-safe, which could result in unexpected behavior when called from multiple threads.";"**Answer:** A

**Explanation:** The issue with the provided implementation is that it does not handle concurrent calls correctly. When multiple instances of `my_function` are called concurrently, each call will check the global `last_call_time`, which can lead to all instances waiting for their turn instead of only one instance at a time. This defeats the purpose of rate limiting. The decorator should maintain separate state for each instance or thread if concurrent access is expected."

D) Error: Cannot run inside async context";"A) Task started  
   Task completed  
   None  

Explanation:
- The `AsyncDecorator` is a class that takes an asynchronous function (`async_task`) as its argument.
- When the decorated function is called, it uses `asyncio.run()` to execute the asynchronous function in a new event loop. This is necessary because `asyncio.run()` is used for running top-level entry point coroutines and should be called only once per program.
- Inside `async_task`, an asyncio sleep of 1 second is simulated using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`.
- When `async_task` completes, the function prints ""Task completed"".
- Since the result of `async_task` is not explicitly returned or captured, it defaults to `None`. Therefore, the final printed output is `Task started`, `Task completed`, and `None`.

Imagine you're developing a web framework in Python, and you want to ensure that all routes defined are secure. You decide to implement a decorator `@secure` that logs the user ID and route accessed before executing the view function. However, you also want this decorator to be reusable across different classes without manually applying it to each method.

Here's a simplified version of what you have:

```python
from functools import wraps

def secure(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        user_id = kwargs.get('user_id')
        route = func.__name__
        print(f""Accessing {route} by user {user_id}"")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class SecureView:

        return ""Welcome to the homepage""

    @secure
    def profile(self, user_id=None):
        return ""This is your profile""
```

Now, you want to create a metaclass that automatically applies this `@secure` decorator to all methods of any class it decorates. This way, you can simply define your view classes without worrying about applying the decorator manually.

Here's your task:
1. Implement a metaclass `SecureMeta` that applies the `@secure` decorator to all non-static methods of any class.
2. Create a class `SecureApp` using this metaclass and define some methods like `home`, `dashboard`, etc.

Write the code for `SecureMeta` and an example usage of `SecureApp`.";"[ANSWER]

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` correctly logs all attribute accesses on instances of `MyClass`.
B) The method `log_access` is added to `MyClass` via the metaclass.
C) The original `__getattribute__` method is preserved and called when accessing attributes.
D) The class `MyClass` cannot be instantiated because of a missing constructor.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The original `__getattribute__` method is preserved and called when accessing attributes.

Explanation:
The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` correctly modifies the `__getattribute__` method of any class it decorates. It wraps the original `__getattribute__` with a new function that logs access to attributes before delegating to the original method. This ensures that all attribute accesses are logged, and the original behavior is preserved.

Option A is incorrect because no logging occurs on attribute access directly; only method calls log access.
Option B is incorrect because no `log_access` method is added; instead, `__getattribute__` is modified.
Option D is incorrect because there is no issue with instantiating `MyClass`; it can be instantiated normally."

C) The `writer.write` method blocks until the data is fully sent to the client.

D) The `main` function runs in a separate thread.

### Part 2 (Answer)

**";"** C

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The `handle_request` function is defined as an asynchronous function with the `async def` syntax, which means it will run asynchronously.
  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The `asyncio.start_server` function creates an asynchronous server. It allows handling multiple client connections concurrently without blocking.

- **Option C**: Correct. The `writer.write` method does not block; it schedules data to be sent and returns immediately. The actual sending happens later, which is why we need to call `await writer.drain()` to ensure the data has been fully sent before closing the connection.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. The `main` function runs in the main thread of the asyncio event loop. If you want it to run in a separate thread, you would typically use `threading` or `concurrent.futures`, but that's not related to how this server is set up.

This question tests understanding of how asyncio works for creating non-blocking servers and how methods like `write` and `drain` function in asynchronous programming."

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `AsyncDecorator` class does not use any asyncio features.

B) When calling `fetch_data`, it will block the event loop until the data is fetched.

C) The `fetch_data` function is automatically converted into a coroutine when decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`.

D) The decorator correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions seamlessly.";"D) The decorator correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions seamlessly.

Explanation: 
The `AsyncDecorator` class defines an `__init__` method that stores the original function, and a `__call__` method that uses `asyncio.run()` to execute the decorated function within the asyncio event loop. Since `fetch_data` is defined as an `async def`, it does not need to be made synchronous; it can be directly run using `asyncio.run()`. Therefore, the decorator correctly handles asynchronous functions without interfering with their async nature."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to automatically log any method call on an instance of a class. The goal is to understand how this works in detail.

Which of the following statements correctly describes how to use and understand the metaclass `LogMeta` in this code?

A) The `MyClass` automatically logs all its methods when called.  
B) The `log_method_call` static method is applied to each instance method of classes that inherit from `MyClass`.  
C) The `LogMeta` only works for class attributes and not for instance methods.  
D) Any class inheriting from `MyClass` can call methods without logging because the metaclass does not affect them.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `MyClass` automatically logs all its methods when called.
This statement is incorrect. The metaclass `LogMeta` intercepts and modifies the class definition, adding a log decorator to each callable attribute (methods). However, this change affects the class itself, not individual instances.

B) The `log_method_call` static method is applied to each instance method of classes that inherit from `MyClass`.
This statement is correct. When a class inherits from `MyClass`, its methods are wrapped by the `log_method_call` decorator during the metaclass's `__new__` method execution. This means every time an instance method of any subclass is called, it will print a log message.

C) The `LogMeta` only works for class attributes and not for instance methods.
This statement is incorrect. As shown in the code, the metaclass applies to all callable attributes, including instance methods, when defining classes that use it as their metaclass.

D) Any class inheriting from `MyClass` can call methods without logging because the metaclass does not affect them.
This statement is incorrect. Due to the modification applied by the metaclass during the definition of subclasses, calling any method on an instance of a subclass will automatically include log output."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure all instances of a class have a unique identifier:

Explanation: The `UniqueIDMeta` metaclass uses a class-level variable `_instance_id` to keep track of the number of instances created. When an instance is created, it assigns the current value of `_instance_id` as its id and then increments `_instance_id`. Therefore, when `a = MyClass()` is executed, `a.id` is set to 0, and when `b = MyClass()` is executed, `b.id` is set to 1."

This code defines a context manager `Timer` that measures and prints the execution time of any block of code it wraps. When `timed_function()` is called, it runs a loop for 1 million iterations inside the `with` statement.

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `__exit__` method will never be called if an exception occurs within the `with` block.
B) The `Timer` class can be used as both a decorator and a context manager.
C) The `Timer` class cannot be subclassed to add new functionality.
D) The `Timer` class uses Python's garbage collector to manage its resources.";"B) The `Timer` class can be used as both a decorator and a context manager.

Explanation:
The provided code snippet demonstrates the use of a context manager. However, it does not provide any indication that this class could also be used as a decorator. Decorators are typically implemented using functions or classes that wrap another function or method, while context managers are used with `with` statements to manage resources like file handles or timers.

For a class to be usable both as a context manager and a decorator, it would need separate methods for these purposes, which is not the case here. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.

Statement A is also incorrect because if an exception occurs within the `with` block, the `__exit__` method will still be called to handle any cleanup or error handling as specified in the context manager protocol.

Option C is incorrect because a class can always be subclassed to add new functionality. The `Timer` class could be extended with additional methods or attributes without breaking its basic functionality.

Statement D is also incorrect as the `Timer` class does not rely on Python's garbage collector for managing its resources. Instead, it manages resources explicitly by using methods like `__enter__` and `__exit__`, which are part of the context management protocol."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `MyClass` will not be instantiated because `LogMeta` prevents instantiation.
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will log ""Instantiating MyClass"".
C) There will be a runtime error because `LogMeta` does not properly define the `__call__` method.
D) The `LogMeta` class must explicitly call `super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)` to allow instantiation.";"B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will log ""Instantiating MyClass"".

Explanation:
The `LogMeta` metaclass correctly overrides the `__new__` method to print a message whenever a class is instantiated. The metaclass's job is to customize class creation, and in this case, it logs a message before calling the superclass's `__new__` method to actually create the class. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `LogMeta` metaclass will be invoked, resulting in the log message ""Instantiating MyClass"" being printed."

B) It will print ""Before calling"", wait for 1 second, then print ""After calling"" and finally output ""Result: 9"".

C) It will execute the function synchronously without any additional prints.

D) The program will hang indefinitely because it is waiting for an infinite loop inside `my_async_function`.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A) C

Explanation:
- The code defines a class decorator `AsyncDecorator` that wraps around an asynchronous function.
- When `my_async_function` is decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`, the decorator's `__call__` method is invoked when the function is called, not when it’s defined.
- Inside `AsyncDecorator.__call__`, ""Before calling"" is printed, then the decorated function (`self.func`) is awaited. During this await, control yields back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run.
- After the awaited task completes (in this case, after 1 second), ""After calling"" is printed, and the result of `my_async_function` is returned.
- When `main()` runs, it calls `await my_async_function(3)`, which results in ""Before calling"", a 1-second delay, then ""After calling"", followed by ""Result: 9"".
- Option A is incorrect because the decorator does handle async functions correctly. Options B and D are incorrect as there's no infinite loop or hanging behavior."

Explanation: In the given code, `await asyncio.sleep(1)` is used to simulate an I/O operation that would block if it were run synchronously. However, because the tasks are awaited using `asyncio.gather`, Python's event loop allows other tasks to run while waiting for the sleep to complete.

B) The `LogMeta` metaclass applies the `log_decorator` to all callable attributes of `MyClass`, effectively wrapping them with a print statement before and after their execution.

C) Using `ContextDecorator` in `LogDecorator` ensures that the `with` statement can be used to manage context, but it will not affect the behavior when called as a regular decorator.

D) The use of both metaclass and decorators on the same methods results in double wrapping due to overlapping effects.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**B**

The `LogMeta` metaclass applies the `log_decorator` to all callable attributes of `MyClass`. This means that both `method1` and `method2` are wrapped with the `log_decorator`, resulting in two ""Before calling function"" and ""After calling function"" outputs when they are called. The `ContextDecorator` class is used in `LogDecorator` to ensure it can be used as a context manager, but this does not affect how it behaves when applied as a decorator.

The other statements are incorrect because:
- A) While both methods are wrapped with the `log_decorator`, each method is only wrapped once.
- C) The use of `ContextDecorator` allows the decorator to function as a context manager, but this does not prevent it from also being used as a regular decorator.
- D) The metaclass and decorators do not result in double wrapping. Each method is decorated only once by both the metaclass and the explicit decorator application."

- The metaclass `Meta` modifies any class it decorates by adding a method `add` that takes an argument and returns the argument incremented by 5.
- When `MyClass` is defined with `metaclass=Meta`, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called to create the class, and the `add` method is added to the class dictionary.
- An instance of `MyClass` is created and the `add` method is called on this instance with the argument 10.

C) The code will raise a `RuntimeError` because the logger is not properly managed.  
D) The output will be ""INFO: Starting"", ""INFO: Processing"", and it will hang waiting for the final ""Ending"".";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Answer:** B) The output will be ""INFO: Starting"", ""INFO: Processing"", ""INFO: Ending"" in that specific order.

**Explanation:**

The given code uses `asyncio.gather` to concurrently run multiple tasks, each of which logs a message. Since all tasks are awaited within the `main` function, they will execute in sequence because `asyncio.gather` schedules them to run as soon as possible but does not guarantee their order if there is any overlap.

To ensure that `logger` is not garbage collected before all logging tasks complete, we need to keep a reference to it. In Python, an object is considered garbage collectible only when there are no more references pointing to it. By keeping the `logger` variable in scope until after all tasks have completed, it ensures that it remains alive long enough for the garbage collector to determine if it can be freed.

For example:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncLogger:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    async def log(self, message):
        print(f""{self.name}: {message}"")

async def main():
    logger = AsyncLogger(""INFO"")
    await asyncio.gather(
        logger.log(""Starting""),
        logger.log(""Processing""),
        logger.log(""Ending"")
    )
    del logger  # Explicitly deleting the reference to allow garbage collection

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this modified version, the `logger` variable is explicitly deleted after all tasks have completed. This ensures that `logger` can be garbage collected if no other references to it exist. However, in practical scenarios, you generally don’t need to explicitly delete variables as Python’s garbage collector handles most cases automatically."

**Explanation:** The `CoroutineDecorator` class is designed to be a decorator for asynchronous functions. When `my_decorated_coroutine` is called, it first runs the undecorated `my_coroutine`, and then proceeds with its own logic. Since `asyncio.run()` is used inside the decorator to execute the decorated coroutine, both the original and decorated coroutine methods are executed within the same event loop run by `asyncio.run()`. This results in the outputs being interleaved as shown in option A."

Consider the following Python code that aims to create a context manager for measuring the execution time of a block of code:

```python

        self.start = time.time()

However, when trying to use this context manager with an asynchronous function, it fails. Your task is to modify the `Timer` class so that it can be used both synchronously and asynchronously.

A) Modify the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to use asyncio's event loop if it exists.
B) Create a separate `AsyncTimer` class that inherits from `Timer` but overrides the context management protocol for async contexts.
C) Use a decorator to convert the `Timer` class into an asynchronous context manager.
D) Implement a new method called `async_enter` and `async_exit` and use them instead of `__enter__` and `__exit__`.";"B) Create a separate `AsyncTimer` class that inherits from `Timer` but overrides the context management protocol for async contexts.

Explanation:
The correct answer is option B. To make the existing `Timer` class work with asynchronous functions, we need to create an `AsyncTimer` class that overrides the context management protocol specifically for use in asynchronous code. This involves implementing methods like `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` instead of the standard `__enter__` and `__exit__`. The existing `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods should be preserved for synchronous use, as they will still work with non-async contexts. By creating a subclass specifically for async usage, we maintain compatibility with both synchronous and asynchronous code without modifying the original class's behavior."

C) Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method  
D) An error will occur because `my_decorator` cannot be applied to methods in Python 3

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is C) Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method.

Explanation: In Python 3, decorators can indeed be applied to instance methods within a class using metaclasses or by directly applying decorators at method definition. Here's how it works:

- When you apply `@my_decorator` above the method `my_method`, it wraps the method with another function that adds some pre and post-execution behavior.
- The `__metaclass__ = type` in the class declaration is necessary because, starting from Python 3, classes are first-class objects and need a metaclass to be properly instantiated. If you omit this line, Python will raise an error because it cannot instantiate a class without a valid metaclass.

Therefore, when you create an instance `obj` of `MyClass` and call `obj.my_method()`, the output will be as follows:
1. The pre-function call message is printed.
2. The method's code runs, printing ""Hello from my_method"".
3. The post-function call message is printed.

This demonstrates that decorators can indeed modify class methods in Python 3, even when using metaclasses for class instantiation."

C) Task started

D) Task started  
   Task finished after 3 seconds  
   Main function completed

**Part 2: Answer**

A) Task started  
   Task finished  
   Main function completed

**Explanation:** 

The `AsyncTimer` class is a decorator that delays the execution of any coroutine it decorates by the specified delay. In this case, `@AsyncTimer(2)` means that any coroutine passed to it will have its execution delayed by 2 seconds before proceeding.

When you call `await slow_task()` in the `main` function, `slow_task` is decorated with `AsyncTimer(2)`. This means that when `slow_task` is called, it first waits for 2 seconds (due to the decorator), and then proceeds with its original execution. The output will therefore be:

1. ""Task started"" (immediately)
2. Task finishes after an additional 2 seconds (""Task finished"")
3. Then, after another second (total of 3 seconds), ""Main function completed""

So, option A is the correct answer as it matches the described behavior."

D) Each thread prints its own key-value pair and finally, 'Final config' will be `{'key_0': 'value_4'}`";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Each thread prints its own key-value pair and finally, 'Final config' will be `{'key_0': 'value_0'}`  

Explanation:
- The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of the `ConfigManager` class is created.
- However, since there is no synchronization mechanism in place (e.g., locks), multiple threads can modify the `configs` dictionary simultaneously, leading to race conditions.
- When a thread writes to `self.configs[key]`, it may not see the most up-to-date value written by another thread due to these race conditions. This explains why the output of each thread printing its own key-value pair but the final config having only one entry (`{'key_0': 'value_4'}`) is possible.
- The actual final config will depend on the timing and order in which threads complete their operations, so `{'key_0': 'value_0'}` is a plausible output among others."

Explanation:

The provided code defines an async decorator `async_decorator` that wraps around another asynchronous function `my_async_function`.

When `main()` is executed, it creates a list of tasks for `my_async_function`, which are then gathered and awaited concurrently. 

The output shows each ""Before calling function"" print statement five times, followed by ""After calling function"" five times. This indicates that the decorator was called correctly five times, once for each task created in the `main()` function. The actual results of the asynchronous tasks (0*2=0, 1*2=2, 2*2=4, 3*2=6, 4*2=8) are not printed because the decorator is only responsible for printing messages before and after the function call.

The correct answer demonstrates an understanding of how decorators work with asynchronous functions in Python, specifically how they can be used to add behavior (in this case, logging) around the execution of other functions."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a simple caching mechanism using decorators. The goal is to cache the results of function calls based on their arguments.

```python

Which of the following is a correct statement regarding the `fibonacci` function when using the `cache_results` decorator?

A) The first call to `fibonacci(5)` will compute all previous Fibonacci numbers up to 3.

B) Subsequent calls to `fibonacci(n)` where `n <= 1` will not be cached.

C) The cache will store results for all arguments passed to `fibonacci`.

D) The cache will only store results for unique sequences of recursive calls that lead to different outcomes.";"[ANSWER] D) The cache will only store results for unique sequences of recursive calls that lead to different outcomes.

**Explanation**: The `cache_results` decorator is designed to cache the results of function calls based on their arguments. In this case, it caches the results of the Fibonacci sequence calculations. When a call to `fibonacci(n)` is made, the decorator first checks if the result for those arguments is already in the cache. If not, it computes the result using the function (in this case, the Fibonacci calculation), stores it in the cache, and then returns the result. For recursive functions like `fibonacci`, different sequences of calls to reach the same base case will produce different results, leading to unique keys in the cache. Therefore, only those unique sequences of recursive calls will be cached."

C) The timer will start but not perform any action.
D) The program will hang indefinitely without printing anything.";"Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is A) The program will print ""Timer tick"" every second.

Explanation: In the provided code, `AsyncTimer` starts an asynchronous task that runs `run()` method using `asyncio.create_task()`. Inside the `run()` method, there's a loop that sleeps for the specified interval (1 second in this case) and then calls the callback function (`on_timer`).

B) Data from http://example.com/0, Data from http://example.com/1, Data from http://example.com/2, Data from http://example.com/3, Data from http://example.com/4

Explanation: The `asyncio.gather` function runs all the coroutines concurrently and waits for all of them to complete. Each coroutine fetches data from a URL in an asynchronous manner. When all coroutines finish, their results are gathered and printed.

Option A is incorrect because it only prints the ""Fetching"" messages before the sleep completes.

D) None of the above.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B: The string ""Hello from metaclass!"" is printed when an instance of `MyClass` is created and the attribute is accessed.

Explanation:
- When a class like `MyClass` is decorated with `Meta`, Python's class creation process invokes the metaclass's `__new__` method.
- In this case, the metaclass `Meta` modifies the dictionary `dct` that defines the class by adding an entry `'added_attribute': 'Hello from metaclass!'`.
- The `super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)` call in `Meta.__new__()` creates a new class with these modifications.
- Therefore, when an instance of `MyClass` is created and the attribute `added_attribute` is accessed on that instance, it correctly returns the string 'Hello from metaclass!'."

A) It enforces that all classes decorated with `class_decorator` must have a class variable named 'decorated'.
B) It ensures that `MyClass` has an attribute called 'decorated' set to True.
C) It raises an error if any class is defined without being decorated, regardless of the decorator used.
D) It checks that all classes using it as their metaclass have a method named 'decorated'.

### Part 2 (Answer)

A) It enforces that all classes decorated with `class_decorator` must have a class variable named 'decorated'.
Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks if the `decorated` attribute is present in the class dictionary during class creation. If it's not found, it raises a `TypeError`. Only `MyClass`, which is decorated with `@class_decorator`, has this attribute set.

B) It ensures that `MyClass` has an attribute called 'decorated' set to True.
Explanation: This is incorrect because the metaclass itself checks for the presence of the `decorated` attribute, not the class decorator. The actual setting happens in the `class_decorator`.

C) It raises an error if any class is defined without being decorated, regardless of the decorator used.
Explanation: This is also incorrect. The metaclass only enforces this rule if it is explicitly used with a decorator that sets the `decorated` attribute.

D) It checks that all classes using it as their metaclass have a method named 'decorated'.

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `add_method` method will not be added to any class that does not use `AddMethodMeta`.
B) When creating an instance of `MyClass`, it immediately calls `new_method` and prints ""Hello from new_method"".
C) Calling `obj.new_method()` will raise an AttributeError.
D) The metaclass is used to dynamically add a method to all classes in the application.";"D) The metaclass is used to dynamically add a method to all classes in the application.

Explanation: In Python, a metaclass is a class that creates and controls other classes. When you define a class with `metaclass=AddMethodMeta`, every instance of that class will have a new method called `new_method`. This is true regardless of whether other classes use the same metaclass or not. The `MyClass` defined in this example is an exception to this rule, as it does not explicitly declare `new_method`, but instances of any class using `AddMethodMeta` will have access to it. Option A is incorrect because only classes explicitly decorated with `AddMethodMeta` will get the new method. Options B and C are incorrect because calling `obj.new_method()` on an instance of a class that does not use `AddMethodMeta` would raise an AttributeError, but since `MyClass` is an exception to this rule, it would not be the case here."

Explanation:
The provided code attempts to make all callable attributes thread-safe using a metaclass. However, in Python, class methods (like `increment`, `decrement`, and `get_value`) do not automatically inherit the `self` parameter, which is necessary for instance-level operations. Therefore, when `add_lock` decorates these methods, they lose their instance context, leading to incorrect behavior or runtime errors.

The `AsyncWebServer` class is intended to start a web server that echoes back any received data. However, when you run the script and try to connect to it using a simple client like `telnet`, you encounter an issue where no response is received from the server.

Identify the problem in this code and suggest how to fix it so that the server correctly handles incoming connections and sends responses as expected.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**A) The problem is with the `handle_client` method not properly handling client disconnections.**
**B) The issue lies in the `start` method not properly closing the server when stopping.**

**Explanation:** The problem lies in the `handle_client` method. While it sends a response back to the client when data is received, it does not handle the case where the client disconnects unexpectedly (e.g., by closing their connection). This can cause the server to get stuck waiting for more data from the disconnected client, which prevents it from processing other incoming connections. To fix this issue, you could add a check to see if there's any data available before attempting to read from the reader, or use an exception handler within the `handle_client` method to gracefully handle client disconnections."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

class ThreadSafeCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    @property
    def value(self):
        with self.lock:
            return self._value

    @value.setter
    def value(self, new_value):
        with self.lock:
            self._value = new_value

    def increment(self):
        with self.lock:
            self.value += 1

def worker(counter):
    for _ in range(1000):

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    counter = ThreadSafeCounter()
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(counter,)) for _ in range(10)]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    print(counter.value)
```

This code attempts to create a thread-safe counter using a `ThreadSafeCounter` class with a private attribute `_value` and a lock. The `increment` method is intended to safely increment the value by 1000 across multiple threads.

Which of the following statements is true regarding the above code?

A) The counter will always print 10000 because it uses threading.Lock to ensure thread safety.
B) The counter may print a number less than 10000 due to race conditions in the `increment` method.
C) The counter will always print 10000, but using decorators would make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
D) The counter may print a number greater than 10000 because of potential deadlocks.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The code uses threading to create multiple threads that increment the shared `counter` object. Each thread performs 1000 increments on the counter. The critical section in the `increment` method is protected by a lock, which means that at any given time, only one thread can execute the code within this section.

However, there are race conditions present in the code. Even though each increment operation is atomic (i.e., it cannot be interrupted), multiple threads can still see and modify `_value` concurrently before their changes are fully written back to memory. This can lead to situations where two or more threads read the same value for `_value`, both increment it, and then write back their incremented values, resulting in a net increase of less than 1000 increments.

Therefore, while the lock ensures that individual increment operations are thread-safe, the overall operation is still subject to race conditions when multiple threads attempt to modify the shared counter concurrently. This means that the final value printed by the program may be less than 10000, making option B correct."

A) ""Task completed"" will be printed after 5 seconds.  
B) The program will hang indefinitely as it is waiting for tasks to complete before exiting.

D) ""Coroutine done"" will be printed after 5 seconds and ""Task completed"" will be printed after every interval of 2 seconds until the coroutine completes.";"A) ""Task completed"" will be printed after 5 seconds.  

**Explanation:** The `run` method of `AsyncTimer` continuously checks for tasks that are not done, and if such a task is found, it waits for the interval time (2 seconds in this case) before printing ""Task completed"". Since the coroutine registered with `register` completes after 5 seconds, when `run` wakes up for the first time, it will print ""Task completed"" at that point. After that, since the coroutine has already finished, no further ""Task completed"" messages will be printed even though the loop continues to run."

Imagine you are developing a library that needs to ensure that all its classes implement certain methods. You want to create a metaclass that checks if these methods exist during class creation and raises an error if they are missing.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
class MethodCheckerMeta(type):
    required_methods = ['method1', 'method2']

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for method in cls.required_methods:

                raise TypeError(f""Class {name} must implement the '{method}' method."")

        pass

# This will work fine
obj = MyClass()

# Uncommenting the following line will raise an error
# class MyMissingMethodsClass(metaclass=MethodCheckerMeta):
#     pass
```

Which of the following is a potential issue with this implementation?

A) The metaclass does not allow for any additional methods to be added to subclasses after creation.

B) The metaclass raises an error when trying to subclass a class that already implements all required methods.

C) The metaclass will correctly raise an error if a method is missing in any subclass.

D) The metaclass can dynamically add the missing methods to classes during their creation.";"C) The metaclass will correctly raise an error if a method is missing in any subclass.

The implementation of `MethodCheckerMeta` checks for the presence of required methods during class creation using `__new__`. If all methods are present, the class is created successfully. However, this implementation does not prevent subclasses from being created without implementing these methods, so option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that existing classes cannot be subclassed, which is not a concern of this metaclass. Option D is incorrect as well since methods are not dynamically added to classes; they must be defined at the time of class creation or inheritance. The correct answer is C, as the metaclass raises an error if any required method is missing in any subclass during their creation."

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify a class dynamically:

        dct['new_attr'] = 'New Attribute'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

Which of the following statements is true about the metaclass `Meta` and its effect on `MyClass`?

A) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to instances of `MyClass`.
B) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to the class itself.
C) Instances of `MyClass` do not have access to `new_attr`.
D) The metaclass has no effect on `MyClass`.";"B) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to the class itself.

Explanation: In Python, when you define a metaclass, it controls how classes are created. By modifying the dictionary (`dct`) passed to the `__new__` method, the metaclass can dynamically add or modify attributes at the class level. In this case, `Meta` adds `new_attr` directly to the `MyClass` dictionary, making it a class attribute rather than an instance attribute. Therefore, instances of `MyClass` do not have access to `new_attr`."

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a class with custom behavior:

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.__value = value

obj = MyClass(10)
```

What is the output of `print(obj.value)`?

A) 10  
B) AttributeError  
C) TypeError  
D) None  

### Part 2: Answer

B) AttributeError

Explanation:
The code attempts to create a custom metaclass (`Meta`) that transforms class attributes into properties. The metaclass dynamically renames each attribute by prefixing it with an underscore and creating a property that accesses this new private attribute.

In the `MyClass`, an attribute named `__value` is defined, but due to the metaclass's behavior, there will be no direct access to this attribute from outside the class. Instead, a property named `value` should be created by the metaclass. However, in the provided code, there is no method to handle this transformation correctly.

When you attempt to access `obj.value`, Python looks for an attribute or property with that name on `MyClass`. Since no such property exists due to the incorrect implementation of the metaclass, it raises an `AttributeError`.

The correct behavior would require adding a method in the metaclass to dynamically create and assign properties for each original attribute.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

What is the output of this script? Explain how the use of metaclasses, decorators, and context managers contributes to thread safety in this example.

A) 0  
B) 1  
C) 2  
D) Error";"B) 1  

The output of this script will be `1`. The use of metaclasses (`SingletonMeta`) ensures that the `ThreadSafeSingleton` class is a singleton, meaning only one instance of it can exist. The decorator pattern is not directly used in this example but could be applied to add additional functionality if needed.

Context managers (`DataAdder`) are crucial for managing resources like locks to ensure thread safety when accessing shared data. In this case, the lock prevents multiple threads from entering the `with` block at the same time, ensuring that the data modification is thread-safe.

The `ThreadSafeSingleton` class itself uses a dictionary (`data`) to store data, and the `add_data_to_singleton` function demonstrates how to use the singleton instance within a context manager. The lock ensures that when the 'temp' key is added, it does not interfere with any other thread attempting to access or modify the same key concurrently.

Therefore, after executing the script, the size of the data dictionary will be `1`, indicating that one item has been successfully added through the context manager while maintaining thread safety."
"2025-06-09 16:03";"";"**Part 1 (Question):**

Imagine you are tasked with creating a system for managing user sessions in an asynchronous web application. You want to ensure that each session has a timeout mechanism, and any session that exceeds this time limit should automatically expire. 

You decide to implement this using Python's `asyncio` library. However, you also want to make sure that the session management logic is easily reusable across different parts of your application without duplicating code.

To achieve this, you consider creating a decorator for sessions that automatically handles the timeout. You then create a metaclass that applies this decorator to any class that represents a session.

Here's an example implementation:

```python
import asyncio

def session_timeout(timeout):
    def decorator(cls):
        async def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            task = loop.create_task(self.__aenter__(*args, **kwargs))
            try:
                result = await asyncio.wait_for(task, timeout=timeout)
                return result
            except asyncio.TimeoutError:
                task.cancel()
                raise Exception(""Session timed out"")
        cls.__aenter__ = wrapper
        return cls
    return decorator

class SessionMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'session_timeout' in dct:
            dct['session_timeout'] = session_timeout(dct['session_timeout'])
        return super().__new__(mcls, name, bases, dct)

class AsyncSession(metaclass=SessionMeta):
    async def __aenter__(self):
        pass

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        pass

# Example usage
class UserSession(AsyncSession):
    session_timeout = 30  # Timeout in seconds

async def main():
    async with UserSession() as session:
        # Simulate work within the session
        await asyncio.sleep(25)
        print(""Session is still active"")

# Run the example
asyncio.run(main())
```

In this implementation, `session_timeout` is a decorator that adds a timeout mechanism to any class decorated with it. The `SessionMeta` metaclass applies this decorator to any class that has a `session_timeout` attribute.

**Question:** What will happen if an instance of `UserSession` is used without waiting for the session to expire, and how does the `AsyncSession` class structure support this functionality?

A) The session will remain active indefinitely.
B) The session will expire after 30 seconds due to the timeout mechanism.
C) An exception will be raised because no timeout was specified.
D) The session will raise an error when trying to access its methods.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The session will expire after 30 seconds due to the timeout mechanism.

Explanation:
The `AsyncSession` class uses a metaclass (`SessionMeta`) that applies a decorator (`session_timeout`) to any class it decorates. In this case, `UserSession` has a `session_timeout` attribute set to 30 seconds. When an instance of `UserSession` is used in an asynchronous context manager (i.e., within the `async with` statement), the `__aenter__` method decorated by `@session_timeout(30)` will be invoked. This method runs the session's entry logic and then waits for it to complete, timing out after 30 seconds if it has not already finished. If the session completes within the timeout period, the result is returned; otherwise, an exception is raised indicating that the session timed out.

The `AsyncSession` class structure supports this functionality by defining abstract methods (`__aenter__` and `__aexit__`) for entering and exiting the session context, respectively. These methods can be overridden in subclasses to provide specific behavior when a session begins or ends. The metaclass ensures that any subclass of `AsyncSession` will have its timeout mechanism applied automatically if it includes a `session_timeout` attribute."

D)

AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute '__init__'
```";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The code uses a metaclass (`Meta`) to automatically decorate all callable attributes of the class it creates with the `log_decorator`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created using the context manager, the `__init__` method is not explicitly defined in the class. Since Python's default behavior for creating instances involves calling `__new__` and then `__init__`, but there's no explicit `__init__`, the metaclass does not add a logging decorator to it.

Therefore, when `obj.method1()` and `obj.method2(3, 4)` are called inside the context manager block:
- The `method1` is decorated with `log_decorator`, so it logs its call before executing.
- The `method2` is also decorated with `log_decorator`, logging its call before executing.

This results in the output:

```
Calling method1 with args: (), kwargs: {}
Executing method1
Calling method2 with args: (3,), kwargs: {'b': 4}
Executing method2 with 3 and 4

B) The tasks will run sequentially, completing in around 12.5 seconds.

D) The code will raise an exception because tasks are not defined correctly.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The tasks will run concurrently, completing in around 0.5 seconds.

Explanation: In this example, `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` is used, which schedules all the tasks to run concurrently. Since each task sleeps for a time equal to its index, the total execution time will be dominated by the longest-running task (the one with the highest index). Therefore, the total execution time will be close to 4 seconds (since task 4 takes the most time)."

You are tasked with creating a caching mechanism that can be applied to any function to store the results of previous computations. This caching mechanism should support both synchronous and asynchronous functions, ensuring efficient use of resources without duplicating computation. Here is a simplified version of how such a caching system might look for synchronous functions:

```python
def cache_results(func):
    cached_results = {}
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if (args, kwargs) not in cached_results:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper

@cache_results
def sync_func(x):
    print(f""Computing {x}"")
    return x * 2

For an asynchronous function, we need to adapt the caching mechanism. Here is a proposed solution:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_cache_results(func):
    cached_results = {}
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if (args, kwargs) not in cached_results:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            cached_results[(args, kwargs)] = result
        return cached_results[(args, kwargs)]
    return wrapper

@async_cache_results
async def async_func(x):
    print(f""Computing {x}"")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an I/O operation
    return x * 3
```

Now, let's test our caching mechanisms:

```python
import time

# Testing synchronous function
start = time.time()
print(sync_func(5))  # Should compute and print 10
time.sleep(1)
print(sync_func(5))  # Should not recompute, just return the cached result
end = time.time()
print(f""Synchronous caching took {end - start} seconds"")

# Testing asynchronous function
async def test_async():
    start = time.time()
    await async_func(5)  # Should compute and print 15
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    await async_func(5)  # Should not recompute, just return the cached result
    end = time.time()
    print(f""Asynchronous caching took {end - start} seconds"")

asyncio.run(test_async())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the functionality and limitations of this caching mechanism?

A. The caching mechanism works for both synchronous and asynchronous functions, and it significantly speeds up computation by avoiding redundant calculations.
B. The caching mechanism does not work with asynchronous functions because asyncio's event loop is needed to handle await expressions, which are not supported outside of an async function.

D. The caching mechanism is flawed because it does not properly invalidate cache entries when inputs change, leading to incorrect results.";"[ANSWER] C. The caching mechanism correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions but may consume more memory due to storing results in a dictionary that grows indefinitely.

After all tasks have completed (due to the `await asyncio.sleep(2)` in each task), the results are gathered and printed. Thus, the messages ""Fetching data..."" appear first, followed by the printed results of the tasks."

C) RuntimeWarning: implicit call to '__init__' in a collection  
D) SyntaxError: invalid syntax";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B) TypeError: Animal must be an abstract class.

Explanation:
In the provided code, the `Meta` metaclass is used to ensure that any subclass of `Animal` must explicitly declare itself as an abstract class by including the key 'abstract' in its dictionary. Since `Animal` does not declare itself as an abstract class and inherits from `ABC`, the metaclass raises a `TypeError` indicating that `Animal` must be an abstract class."

What is the issue with this decorator and how can it be fixed to correctly measure execution time?

A) The `wrapper` function does not store the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, leading to incorrect execution time measurements.

B) The `timer` decorator should use a class instead of a function for better code organization and potential future enhancements.

C) The `wrapper` function does not release any resources it might acquire during execution, which could lead to resource leaks.

D) None of the above. The decorator is correctly implemented to measure execution time.";"A) The `wrapper` function does not store the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, leading to incorrect execution time measurements.

The issue with the current implementation is that while it measures the time taken by the function call and prints it, it does not actually use the returned value. This can lead to confusion if the function's return value is being used elsewhere in the code. To fix this, you should store and return the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)` within the `wrapper` function."

Which of the following statements is true about the provided code?

A) The `fetch_data` function is a synchronous function that fetches data from the given URL.
B) The `main` function uses `asyncio.gather` to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and waits for all of them to complete.
C) The `await asyncio.sleep(1)` in `fetch_data` will block the entire program until 1 second has passed.
D) The code will not execute because it is missing a decorator or context manager.";"B) The `main` function uses `asyncio.gather` to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and waits for all of them to complete.

Explanation: The code correctly demonstrates the use of asynchronous functions with `await` in an `asyncio` event loop. The `fetch_data` function is defined with `async def`, indicating it's an asynchronous function that performs a non-blocking operation using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`. The `main` function creates a list of tasks by calling `fetch_data` with different URLs and then uses `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` to run all these tasks concurrently. Finally, it waits for all tasks to complete before printing their results. This demonstrates effective use of asynchronous programming in Python to handle multiple I/O-bound operations efficiently."

Consider the following Python code that uses metaclasses to add a method to all classes dynamically:

class Derived(Base):
    pass

def test_metaclass():
    obj = Derived()
    assert obj.new_method() == 'This is a new method'
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `new_method` will only be added to the `Derived` class, not `Base`.

B) When `Derived` inherits from `Base`, no methods are added because metaclasses cannot modify existing classes.

C) The `new_method` will be available on all instances of any subclass of `Base`, including `Derived`.

D) The `new_method` is only accessible if the class is instantiated directly with `Meta()`, not through inheritance.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
In Python, metaclasses control how a class is created. When a new class is defined, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called with the class name, its base classes, and a dictionary of attributes. The code in the question demonstrates that the metaclass adds a method to all classes derived from it.

In this case, when `Derived` inherits from `Base`, the `Meta.__new__` method is invoked for both `Base` and `Derived`. This means that `new_method` is added not just to `Derived` but also to any class that inherits from `Base`. Therefore, when an instance of `Derived` or any other subclass of `Base` is created, it will have access to the `new_method`.

This example shows how metaclasses can be used to add functionality across all subclasses dynamically, making them a powerful tool for advanced Python development."

A) 
Function method1 called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}
10

Function method2 called with args: (4,), kwargs: {}

**Explanation:**  
The `log_arguments` decorator logs the arguments and keyword arguments when a function is called. The `MyMeta` metaclass automatically decorates all callable attributes of any class it creates with `log_arguments`. When you create an instance of `MyClass`, both `method1` and `method2` are decorated with `log_arguments`.

B) The execution time of `compute_sum` is measured in milliseconds.

C) The decorator `timer` can be used to measure the execution time of any function, regardless of its complexity.

D) Applying the `timer` decorator increases memory usage due to additional function calls.

### Part 2 (Answer)
**A) The `compute_sum` function will execute faster with the decorator applied.**

**Explanation:** This is incorrect because adding a decorator that measures execution time will introduce some overhead, which can potentially slow down the function's execution if it's already optimized. The decorator adds a small cost by recording and calculating the time before and after the function call.

**B) The execution time of `compute_sum` is measured in milliseconds.**

**Explanation:** This statement is incorrect because the `time.time()` function returns the current time in seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970). While it provides high resolution, it does not directly measure in milliseconds.

**C) The decorator `timer` can be used to measure the execution time of any function, regardless of its complexity.**

**Explanation:** This statement is correct. Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code. The `timer` decorator can be applied to any function to measure how long it takes to execute.

**D) Applying the `timer` decorator increases memory usage due to additional function calls.**

**Explanation:** This statement is partially correct. While applying a decorator does introduce additional function calls, which can affect performance and potentially increase memory usage slightly, the impact is generally minimal for most use cases. More significant changes would be expected in terms of execution time rather than memory usage.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

After function call  

B) Data fetched  
Before function call  
After function call  

C) Error: 'fetch_data' is not an awaitable object  

D) None";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is A) Before function call  
Data fetched  
After function call  

Explanation:

- The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator is applied to the `fetch_data` coroutine.
- When `asyncio.run(main())` is called, it starts the event loop and schedules the execution of `main()`.
- Inside `main()`, `await fetch_data()` is encountered. This triggers the `__call__` method of the `AsyncDecorator` class.
- The decorator prints ""Before function call"" before calling `self.func(*args, **kwargs)`, which is `fetch_data()`.
- The execution of `fetch_data()` is paused, and control returns to the event loop to process other tasks (in this case, there are no other tasks).
- After 1 second, the simulated network request completes, and `fetch_data()` resumes, returning ""Data fetched"".
- The decorator then prints ""After function call"" and returns the result.
- Finally, `main()` receives the result of `fetch_data()`, which is printed as ""Data fetched"".

Therefore, the output will be:

```
Before function call
Data fetched
After function call

C) Using a metaclass in this way can lead to unintended side effects, such as modifying classes defined in other modules.

**Explanation**: The metaclass `AutoResetMeta` automatically adds a `reset` method to any class it decorates. This method sets all non-callable attributes (excluding magic methods like `__init__`) to zero when called. While this might be useful for certain scenarios, it can have unintended side effects if used on classes that are defined in other modules or are part of larger systems where such modifications could cause issues. Additionally, while the implementation does reset all non-method attributes to zero, not just integer ones, option A is close but not entirely accurate because it implies a type check which isn't present."

When `MyClass` is instantiated as `obj = MyClass()`, the `Meta.__new__` method is automatically called because `MyClass` specifies `metaclass=Meta`.

Which of the following is a potential issue with this server implementation that could lead to unexpected behavior or resource leaks?

A) The use of `asyncio.sleep(3600)` in an infinite loop might prevent the event loop from processing other tasks.

B) There's no mechanism for stopping the server gracefully, which could lead to hanging threads if not handled properly.

C) The server does not handle exceptions that may occur within request handlers like `handle_request`.

D) None of the above; the provided code is correct and does not have any issues.";"B) There's no mechanism for stopping the server gracefully, which could lead to hanging threads if not handled properly.

Explanation: The current implementation lacks a way to stop or shut down the server.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print(""Fetching data..."")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate a delay
    return ""Data fetched""

class AsyncLogger:
    async def __aenter__(self):

        return data

# Usage
result = asyncio.run(process_data())
print(f""Processed result: {result}"")
```

Which of the following statements is true about the above code?

A) The `fetch_data` function will run synchronously because it uses `async def`.

B) The `process_data` function will execute the `fetch_data` and `log` methods concurrently.

C) The `AsyncLogger` class implements asynchronous context management using `__aenter__`, `log`, and `__aexit__`.

D) The `result` variable will contain the string ""Processed result: Data fetched"".";"### Part 2 (Answer)
**Correct Answer:** C

**Detailed Explanation:** 
- **Statement A is incorrect**: While `fetch_data` is defined with `async def`, it does not execute asynchronously unless called within an asynchronous context. The coroutine nature of `fetch_data` means it can pause execution at the `await asyncio.sleep(2)` line, but it won't run until scheduled in an event loop.
- **Statement B is incorrect**: Asynchronous operations like calling a coroutine (e.g., `fetch_data()`) will not execute concurrently within a single thread unless explicitly managed using features like `asyncio.create_task` or scheduling them in different tasks. In the given code, `await fetch_data()` and `await logger.log(data)` are sequential, not concurrent.
- **Statement C is correct**: The `AsyncLogger` class correctly implements asynchronous context management by defining the methods `__aenter__`, `log`, and `__aexit__`. This allows the class to manage resources asynchronously when used with `async with`.
- **Statement D is incorrect**: The value of `result` will be the data returned by `fetch_data()`, which is ""Data fetched"". Therefore, `result` will not contain ""Processed result: Data fetched""; it will simply contain ""Data fetched"".

This question tests the understanding of asynchronous programming in Python, specifically the use of coroutines and context managers for resource management."
"2025-06-17 16:02";"[QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a custom logging system that automatically prefixes each log message with the current timestamp. This system should be implemented as a decorator for any function that needs logging capabilities.

1. Create a decorator `log_with_timestamp` that can be applied to any function.
2. The decorator should prepend the current timestamp (formatted as ""YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"") to each log message.
3. Ensure that the original function is still callable after decoration.

Here is an example of how you might use this decorator:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def log_with_timestamp(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Your implementation here
        pass
    return wrapper

@log_with_timestamp
def my_function():
    print(""This is a test log message."")

my_function()
```

Which of the following snippets correctly implements the `log_with_timestamp` decorator?

A) 
```python
from datetime import datetime

def log_with_timestamp(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")
        print(f""{timestamp} - {func.__name__} called with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
```

B) 
```python
from datetime import datetime

def log_with_timestamp(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")
        print(f""{timestamp} - {func.__name__}"")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
```

C) 
```python
from datetime import datetime

def log_with_timestamp(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")
        print(f""{timestamp} - {func.__name__}"")
        return func()
    return wrapper

        print(f""{timestamp} - {func.__name__}"")
    return wrapper
```";"A) Correct. This implementation correctly logs the timestamp and function call details while allowing the original function to execute.

B) Incorrect. The decorator does not capture the arguments passed to the function, which is necessary for a more comprehensive log message.

C) Incorrect. Calling `func()` without passing any arguments will result in an error if the function requires arguments.

D) Incorrect. This implementation only logs the timestamp and function name, but does not pass any arguments or execute the original function."
"2025-06-18 00:01";"";"**Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class attribute counter. The goal is to count how many instances of the class have been created.

```python
class InstanceCounter(type):
    _instance_count = 0

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        cls._instance_count += 1

    @classmethod
    def get_instance_count(cls):
        return cls._instance_count

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceCounter):
    pass
```

Now, if you create multiple instances of `MyClass` and then call the class method `get_instance_count`, which value will it return?

A) 0  
B) The number of times `MyClass` was subclassed  
C) The number of instances of `MyClass` created  
D) None of the above

**Part 2: Answer**

C) The number of instances of `MyClass` created

Explanation:
- The metaclass `InstanceCounter` is defined to count the number of instances created by any class that uses it as a metaclass.
- In the `__call__` method, each time an instance of a class using this metaclass is created, `_instance_count` is incremented by 1.
- The `get_instance_count` class method returns the current value of `_instance_count`, which reflects how many instances of classes using `InstanceCounter` have been created.

Thus, if you create multiple instances of `MyClass`, calling `MyClass.get_instance_count()` will return the correct number of instances created."

D. None of the above";"**Explanation:**

The correct answer is A. The metaclass `MyMeta` overrides the `__call__` method to log the arguments passed when an instance of `MyClass` is created. This demonstrates how you can extend and modify the behavior of class instantiation using a metaclass in Python."
"2025-06-18 16:03";"### Question:
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to implement a simple caching mechanism for asynchronous functions using a metaclass:

```python
import asyncio

class CacheMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        cache = {}
        original_method = dct.get('fetch_data')

        if original_method:
            async def cached_method(*args, **kwargs):
                key = args + tuple(kwargs.items())
                if key not in cache:
                    cache[key] = await original_method(*args, **kwargs)
                return cache[key]
            
            dct['fetch_data'] = cached_method

        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class DataFetcher(metaclass=CacheMeta):
    async def fetch_data(self, url):
        # Simulate an HTTP request
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(""http://example.com""))
    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(""http://example.com""))  # This should be fetched from cache

asyncio.run(main())
```

What issue might arise with this implementation, and how can it be fixed?

A) The `cache` dictionary is not thread-safe and could lead to race conditions.

B) The caching mechanism does not handle asynchronous operations correctly.

C) The original method name is changed without proper handling, leading to potential issues when subclassing.

D) The cache will always be empty due to the incorrect use of `key`.";"### Answer:
A) The `cache` dictionary is not thread-safe and could lead to race conditions.

**Explanation:** In this implementation, the caching mechanism uses a simple dictionary without any synchronization mechanisms. If multiple asynchronous operations are performed concurrently and access the cache simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions where two or more tasks might attempt to write to or read from the same key in the cache at the same time. This could result in incorrect data being returned or other unexpected behavior.

**Correct Fix:** To resolve this issue, you should use a thread-safe caching mechanism such as `threading.Lock` for synchronous code or `asyncio.Lock` for asynchronous code to ensure that only one task can access the cache at a time. Here is an example of how you might modify the caching mechanism using `asyncio.Lock`:

```python
import asyncio

class CacheMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        cache = {}
        lock = asyncio.Lock()
        original_method = dct.get('fetch_data')

        if original_method:
            async def cached_method(*args, **kwargs):
                key = args + tuple(kwargs.items())
                async with lock:
                    if key not in cache:
                        cache[key] = await original_method(*args, **kwargs)
                    return cache[key]
            
            dct['fetch_data'] = cached_method

        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class DataFetcher(metaclass=CacheMeta):
    async def fetch_data(self, url):
        # Simulate an HTTP request
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        return f""Data from {url}""

# Usage
async def main():
    fetcher = DataFetcher()
    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(""http://example.com""))
    print(await fetcher.fetch_data(""http://example.com""))  # This should be fetched from cache

asyncio.run(main())
```

By using `async with lock`, you ensure that only one task can execute the critical section of code (i.e., accessing or updating the cache) at a time, thus preventing race conditions and ensuring that the caching mechanism works correctly under concurrent access."

A) Each class will have its own independent counter, ensuring that `User` instances and `Product` instances will have unique identifiers.

B) The metaclass shares a single `_counter` between all classes using it, meaning both `User` and `Product` instances will share the same set of identifiers.

D) The metaclass implementation is correct but may lead to memory leaks due to improper use of class variables.";"B) The metaclass shares a single `_counter` between all classes using it, meaning both `User` and `Product` instances will share the same set of identifiers.

**Explanation:** In Python, metaclass attributes are shared across all subclasses. Therefore, in the provided code, `_counter` is a class attribute of `UniqueIDMeta`, which means any modification to it through an instance of a subclass (like `User`) will affect the value for all instances of other subclasses (`Product`).

D) An instance of `AsyncClass` can be created without any errors, and when `_run` is called on that instance, it will execute asynchronously.

Explanation: 
- The `AsyncMeta` metaclass dynamically decorates all methods in the subclass with `async_decorator`, but since `_run` already has a method named `_run`, it does not get affected by the decorator.
- When an instance of `AsyncClass` is created, the `_run` coroutine is decorated and can be called asynchronously using `await`.

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a custom decorator to measure the execution time of functions:

Which of the following modifications to the `compute_sum` function would correctly handle the case where the function is called with no arguments?

A) Change the decorator to accept default parameters.

B) Modify the `timer` decorator to ensure it handles functions without arguments gracefully.

C) Add a conditional inside the `wrapper` function to check if `args` and `kwargs` are empty.

D) None of the above. The current implementation is correct and robust.";"B) Modify the `timer` decorator to ensure it handles functions without arguments gracefully.

Explanation: The current implementation of the `timer` decorator assumes that there will always be at least one argument (`func`) passed to it. If a function decorated with `@timer` does not accept any arguments, calling this function will result in a TypeError because the wrapper will not receive any positional or keyword arguments other than those intended for the wrapped function itself.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that our decorator can handle functions without arguments correctly. One way to do this is by modifying the `timer` decorator to check if `args` and `kwargs` are empty within the wrapper function and adjust its behavior accordingly. For example:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n=1000):  # Added default argument to make the function callable without arguments
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i
    return total

This modification ensures that the `compute_sum` function can be called with or without an argument, and the `timer` decorator will still work correctly."

The correct answer is C) After function call.

Explanation:
When the `@MyDecorator` syntax is used, Python internally calls `MyDecorator(my_function)` to create an instance of `MyDecorator`. This instance is then invoked with `my_function()` as its argument. The `__call__` method of `MyDecorator` is what gets executed when the decorated function is called. It first prints ""Before function call"", then executes the original function, and finally prints ""After function call"". Therefore, when `my_function()` is called, it will print:

```
Before function call
Inside the function
After function call

A) The `AsyncTimer` class is a decorator that can be applied to any coroutine function. When applied, it prints the current time every 2 seconds.
B) The `AsyncTimer` class defines a metaclass that modifies coroutine functions.
C) The `print_time` function will run indefinitely but will not print anything because it lacks an `await` statement within the loop.
D) The code will raise a `TypeError` because asyncio coroutines cannot be decorated with non-coroutine functions.";"A) The `AsyncTimer` class is a decorator that can be applied to any coroutine function. When applied, it prints the current time every 2 seconds.

Explanation: In this solution, the `AsyncTimer` class is designed as a decorator for asyncio coroutines. It uses a call method to wrap the coroutine and run it in an infinite loop with a sleep interval of 2 seconds between executions. This allows the coroutine `print_time` to be executed repeatedly at fixed intervals, printing the current time each time. Therefore, statement A accurately describes the behavior of the code."

Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to implement a simple memoization decorator for functions:

```python
from functools import wraps

def memoize(func):
    cache = {}
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        else:
            result = func(*args)
            cache[args] = result
            return result
    return wrapper

@memoize
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

However, this implementation has a critical flaw that affects its performance. What is the flaw and how can it be corrected?

A) The `cache` dictionary will grow indefinitely because there's no limit to the number of unique arguments that could be passed to the `fibonacci` function.

B) The decorator does not handle the case where the function might be called with non-hashable arguments, causing a TypeError.

C) The `cache` dictionary is being created inside the decorator, leading to each decorated function having its own separate cache. This can be corrected by moving the `cache` outside the decorator.

D) The decorator does not support keyword arguments, which would lead to issues when calling functions with keyword parameters.";"C) The `cache` dictionary is being created inside the decorator, leading to each decorated function having its own separate cache. This can be corrected by moving the `cache` outside the decorator.

The issue with the current implementation is that the `cache` dictionary is recreated every time the `memoize` decorator is applied to a function, resulting in each function having its own independent cache. This not only increases memory usage but also makes the memoization mechanism less effective because it does not share cached results between different instances of decorated functions.

To correct this, we need to move the `cache` dictionary outside the decorator so that it is shared across all decorated functions:

```python
from functools import wraps

cache = {}

def memoize(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        else:
            result = func(*args)
            cache[args] = result
            return result
    return wrapper

@memoize
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

With this change, the `cache` dictionary is shared across all instances of decorated functions, and memoization will work correctly for the `fibonacci` function."

Which of the following statements is true regarding the use and functionality of this decorator?

A) The `timer` decorator will correctly measure the execution time of any function it decorates, including `compute_sum`.

B) The `wrapper` function inside `timer` captures all arguments and keyword arguments passed to the decorated function and passes them along.

C) If another decorator is added above `@timer`, such as `@memoize`, it will not affect the execution time measurement by `timer`.

D) The `timer` decorator can be used with asynchronous functions without modification, but the output will not include any meaningful timing information.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A) This statement is incorrect because while the decorator itself works to measure execution time, it does not account for I/O operations if they are performed within the function. If `compute_sum` involves expensive I/O operations, their time would not be included in the measurement.

B) Correct. The `wrapper` function correctly captures and passes all arguments (`*args, **kwargs`) to the original function, ensuring that the decorator does not alter how functions are called.

C) True. Decorators are applied sequentially from top to bottom. If another decorator like `@memoize` is added above `@timer`, its effects would be isolated from the timing measurement by `timer`.

D) Incorrect. Asyncio can be used with decorators, and the timing would still correctly measure the CPU-bound time taken by the function, ignoring other asyncio-related tasks or I/O wait times that might not include in a simple timing measurement."

B) The first task starts immediately, but subsequent tasks wait for the previous one to finish before starting.

C) The tasks are executed sequentially, waiting for each one to complete before moving on to the next.

D) Each task delay is doubled with respect to the previous task due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) All tasks will start immediately upon calling `asyncio.gather` and complete concurrently.

Explanation:
- In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This means that even though asyncio allows for concurrent execution of I/O-bound tasks, CPU-bound tasks are still subject to the GIL.
- When using `asyncio.gather`, all tasks are scheduled concurrently by asyncio's event loop. The tasks start immediately upon being passed to `asyncio.gather`.
- Each task runs in parallel as long as it is waiting for I/O operations (like `await asyncio.sleep(delay)`). Since these tasks involve sleeping, they do not block the event loop, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.
- Therefore, all tasks will start immediately and complete concurrently, with each waiting for its specified delay. This behavior demonstrates how asyncio manages asynchronous tasks effectively without being constrained by the GIL in I/O-bound scenarios."

B) Entering context Fetching data... Exiting context Data fetched  
C) Fetching data... Data fetched Exiting context  
D) Entering context Data fetched Exiting context";"**Part 2 (Answer):**
The correct answer is B) Entering context Fetching data... Exiting context Data fetched.

Explanation:
- The `async with` statement is used to create an asynchronous context manager.
- When the `main` function runs, it enters the `AsyncContextManager` by calling its `__aenter__` method, which prints ""Entering context"".
- Next, it awaits the `fetch_data` coroutine, which prints ""Fetching data..."" and then waits for 2 seconds before returning ""Data fetched"".
- After `fetch_data` completes, the `main` function continues to print the returned data.
- The `async with` statement also calls the `__aexit__` method of the context manager, which prints ""Exiting context"".

The order of execution is clearly visible in the output, demonstrating how `__aenter__`, `await fetch_data()`, and `__aexit__` are executed in sequence."

Explanation:
- The `my_decorator` function modifies the `__new__` method of the class to print ""Decorator is called"" whenever an instance of `MyClass` is created.
- The metaclass `Meta` checks if the dictionary `dct` contains a key 'x'. If it does, it prints a message indicating that it added the attribute. In this case, since `MyClass` has an attribute `x = 5`, the metaclass will print ""Metaclass added attribute: 5"".

- Option B is incorrect because the `__init__` method of the `Singleton` class will only be called once when the first instance is created. Subsequent creations through the same metaclass will return the existing instance without reinitializing it.
- Option C is correct; the `_instances` dictionary uses the class (`cls`) as the key, which ensures that each subclass (if any) would have its own separate instance stored in the dictionary.

You are tasked with creating a decorator that can be applied to any function or method. This decorator should measure the execution time of the function it decorates, but only if the function returns a specific value. If the function does not return this specific value, the decorator should not record the execution time. Here's an example usage:

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The program will print ""Task 0 started"" before printing ""Task 1 started"".
B) The tasks are executed concurrently, but their completion order is not guaranteed.
C) All tasks must be completed in the order they were created.
D) The program will raise an error because asyncio.sleep() does not work with async functions.";"B) The tasks are executed concurrently, but their completion order is not guaranteed.

Explanation:
The code demonstrates the use of asyncio to execute multiple tasks concurrently. When `asyncio.gather` is used with multiple awaitable objects (in this case, asynchronous functions), it runs them all at the same time and waits for all to complete. The order in which the tasks start executing can be determined by Python's event loop scheduler, but there is no guarantee about their completion order. This makes option B correct while options A, C, and D are incorrect."

You are tasked with creating a Python decorator that measures the execution time of asynchronous functions. The decorator should be used on an async function, and it should return the time taken to execute the function.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

@async_execution_time
async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return ""Data fetched""

# Usage
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(fetch_data())
print(result)
```

The `async_execution_time` decorator is intended to measure and print the time taken by the `fetch_data` function when called. However, it is not implemented correctly.

Which of the following options correctly implements the `async_execution_time` decorator?

A) 
```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps

def async_execution_time(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f""Execution time: {end - start} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

B) 
```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps

def async_execution_time(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f""Execution time: {end - start} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

C) 
```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps

def async_execution_time(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()

        end = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f""Execution time: {end - start} seconds"")
        return result

        print(f""Execution time: {end - start} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper
```";"Answer: D

Explanation:
The correct implementation of the `async_execution_time` decorator is provided in option D. It uses `loop.time()` to measure the execution time correctly within an asynchronous context. The decorator wraps the original function and measures the time before and after the execution of the async function using the event loop's timing method, ensuring that the timing is accurate even when running inside an asyncio event loop."

Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a decorator which logs function calls with their arguments:

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The decorator will correctly log the function calls as expected.

B) The decorator will cause a runtime error because `functools.wraps` is not used.

C) The decorator will work but the logged arguments will be incorrect due to how `*args` and `**kwargs` are handled.

D) None of the above";"A) The decorator will correctly log the function calls as expected.

Explanation: This statement is true. The `functools.wraps` decorator is used correctly to preserve the metadata of the original function, including its name, docstring, and other attributes. Therefore, when the `add` function is called with arguments `(3, 4)`, it will print ""Calling add((3, 4), {})"" as expected. The use of `*args` and `**kwargs` in both the wrapper and the original function ensures that all positional and keyword arguments are correctly passed through."

    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
    
    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `log_method_calls` decorator only logs calls to methods in `Calculator`, but not in any subclass.
B) The `Meta` metaclass dynamically adds logging capabilities to all methods defined in any class that uses it as its metaclass.
C) When an instance of `Calculator` is created, `__init__` is called on the wrapped version of `Calculator`.
D) Calling `add(2, 3)` on an instance of `Calculator` will print ""Calling add with args: (2, 3), kwargs: {}"" and then return 5.";"B) The `Meta` metaclass dynamically adds logging capabilities to all methods defined in any class that uses it as its metaclass.

Explanation:
- The `log_method_calls` decorator wraps callable attributes of a class to add logging functionality. However, it is applied within the `Meta` metaclass.
- The `Meta` metaclass iterates over the attributes of the class being created and applies the `log_method_calls` decorator to any callable methods found.
- This means that all methods in classes defined with `Meta` as their metaclass will have logging capabilities added, not just those explicitly in `Calculator`.
- When an instance of a class using `Meta` is created, the `__init__` method of the metaclass's generated class is called. However, it does not modify the `__init__` method itself; it wraps any callable attributes to add logging.
- Calling `add(2, 3)` on an instance of `Calculator` will indeed print ""Calling add with args: (2, 3), kwargs: {}"" and then return 5, demonstrating that the decorator has been applied."

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) When an instance of `SubClass1` or `SubClass2` calls `auto_method()`, it will return ""Hello from SubClass1"" and ""Hello from SubClass2"" respectively.

B) The method `auto_method()` is added to all subclasses dynamically at runtime using the metaclass.

C) The `AutoAddMethodMeta` metaclass can only be used with classes that inherit directly from `Base`.

D) When an instance of any subclass calls `auto_method()`, it will always return ""Hello from Base"" because `Base` is the top-level class and defines the method.";"Part 2 (Answer):
B) The method `auto_method()` is added to all subclasses dynamically at runtime using the metaclass.

Explanation: 
The metaclass `AutoAddMethodMeta` is defined such that it adds a new method `auto_method` to any class that uses this metaclass, including its subclasses. This method returns a string indicating the name of the class where it was called from. Therefore, when an instance of either `SubClass1` or `SubClass2` calls `auto_method()`, it will correctly return ""Hello from SubClass1"" and ""Hello from SubClass2"", respectively.

Option A is incorrect because it incorrectly states what the method returns.
Option C is incorrect because there's no restriction on which classes can use this metaclass; any class defined with `metaclass=AutoAddMethodMeta` will have the method added.
Option D is incorrect because each subclass receives its own copy of the method, and it correctly reflects the class name where it was called."

C) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, both `method1` and `method2` will be called with additional debug prints before execution.
D) `MyClass` cannot have any non-callable attributes because the metaclass modifies only methods.";"B) The `DebugMeta` metaclass changes all callable attributes of a class to debug versions.

Explanation:
- The `debug_method` decorator wraps any callable (method, function) with additional debugging print statements.
- The `DebugMeta` metaclass uses `__prepare__` and `__new__` to apply the `debug_method` decorator to all callable items in the class dictionary before the class is fully created. This includes both methods (`method1` and `method2`) as well as any other callable attributes that might be added later.
- Therefore, when an instance of `MyClass` is created, calling either `method1` or `method2` will indeed include additional debug prints before the actual method execution, making option C true. However, since all callables are affected, option A and D are incorrect because they only apply to methods. Option B accurately describes the behavior of the metaclass."

**Explanation:** The `Meta` metaclass decorates all callable attributes of any class instantiated with it using the `my_decorator`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, both `method1` and `method2` are automatically wrapped by `my_decorator`, which adds pre- and post-function call print statements.

"2025-06-28 00:02";"**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print(""Connecting to database..."")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

Now, imagine you want to enhance this singleton behavior so that the instance creation is thread-safe. Modify the `SingletonMeta` metaclass accordingly.

A. Use `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method.
B. Replace the `_instances` dictionary with an `OrderedDict`.
C. Use a context manager for the lock.
D. Implement `__new__` instead of `__call__`.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A. Use `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method.

Explanation:
The correct answer is to use a `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method of the metaclass to ensure that instance creation is thread-safe. This approach involves creating an instance only if it does not already exist, and locking during this process to prevent multiple threads from creating different instances simultaneously. Here's how you can modify the code:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
                cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print(""Connecting to database..."")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

In this solution, the `_lock` attribute of the metaclass ensures that only one thread can enter the `if cls not in cls._instances` block at a time, thus guaranteeing that the singleton property is maintained even when accessed from multiple threads."

D. Both classes can have multiple instances, depending on how they are used in different parts of a program.";"**C. The `singleton` decorator and `SingletonMeta` metaclass both ensure that only one instance of their respective classes exists.**

Explanation: The provided decorator uses `time.time()` which returns the current CPU time, not the actual elapsed wall-clock time. When applied to an asynchronous function, the execution of the async function is not blocking the main thread, so `time.time()` before and after the call will return approximately the same value, leading to a zero execution time being printed. Additionally, since the decorator does not handle coroutines correctly, calling it with an `async` function will result in an error because the decorator expects synchronous functions."

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `LoggingMeta` metaclass automatically logs all attribute accesses for any method in a class it decorates.

B) The `log_access` static method transforms every callable (method or function) in a decorated class into a version that logs its access before executing.

C) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `__init__` method does not log its execution because it is not a callable.

D) Using this metaclass, all attribute accesses within any class using it would be logged, but only if they are explicitly defined in the `__dict__`.

Part 2 (Answer):
B) The `log_access` static method transforms every callable (method or function) in a decorated class into a version that logs its access before executing.

This statement is correct. The `LoggingMeta` metaclass uses ` setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_access(attr_name, dct[attr_name]))` to replace each method with a wrapped version of itself that logs access before calling the original method.

```

This code defines a `Timer` class to measure execution time and a decorator `measure_time` to wrap functions with timing functionality. The function `compute_sum` calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. 

**Question:**  
What is the output when running the provided code? Why does this occur?

A) It prints the elapsed time followed by the sum of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000.  
B) It only prints the sum of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000.  
C) It raises an error because `measure_time` does not handle exceptions.  
D) It measures and prints the execution time but fails to return any value.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is **A**.

Explanation:  
When you decorate a function with `@measure_time`, it wraps the original function (`compute_sum`) in a new function that starts a timer, calls the original function, measures the elapsed time, and then prints this time. The decorator returns the result of the original function, which is also returned by the wrapper. Therefore, running the code will print both the execution time (which is a positive number) followed by the sum of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000.

Options B and C are incorrect because there are no exceptions being raised or not handled correctly in this case. Option D is also incorrect because the function does return a value, which is the result of `compute_sum(1000000)`."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a simple cache mechanism for functions. The goal is to cache the results of function calls so that if the same arguments are passed again, the cached result is returned instead of recomputing it.

```python
from functools import wraps

def cache_results(func):
    cache = {}
    
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        else:
            result = func(*args)
            cache[args] = result
            return result
    
    return wrapper

@cache_results
def expensive_function(x):
    # Simulate an expensive computation
    print(f""Computing {x}"")
    return x * x

# Example usage
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should compute and cache the result
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should retrieve the cached result
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `cache_results` decorator correctly implements caching for the function it decorates.
B) The use of a dictionary to store the cache within the decorator is problematic and will lead to memory leaks.
C) The `wrapper` function does not need the `@wraps(func)` decorator because it's not essential for maintaining the original function's metadata.
D) The caching mechanism can be improved by making the cache thread-safe.";"[ANSWER] D

**Explanation:** The caching mechanism implemented in the code is correct, but the caching itself is not thread-safe. Multiple threads could potentially write to and read from the `cache` dictionary simultaneously without proper synchronization, which could lead to data corruption or race conditions. By using a thread-safe dictionary or implementing locks within the decorator, this issue can be resolved."

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior of `MyClass` when its methods are called?

A) When `method1(5)` is called, it prints ""Calling method1 with args: (5,), kwargs: {}"" and then returns 6.
B) When `method2(3)` is called, it returns 6 without any additional output.
C) The metaclass changes the behavior of all methods in `MyClass` to print debug information before and after the method call.
D) The metaclass does not modify the behavior of any methods, and calling `method1(5)` or `method2(3)` will produce the same results as without the metaclass.";"### Part 2 (Answer):
C) The metaclass changes the behavior of all methods in `MyClass` to print debug information before and after the method call.

Explanation:
The `MethodDecorator` metaclass iterates over all attributes of the class being defined. If an attribute is callable (i.e., a function or method) and does not start with double underscores, it wraps that function using the `method_decorator`. The decorator adds print statements to both the beginning and end of the function, allowing for debugging purposes without altering the original functionality of the method.

When methods `method1` and `method2` are called on an instance of `MyClass`, the metaclass's modifications ensure that they first print debug information about their call, then execute normally, and finally print the result. This behavior is observed in the provided code snippet where calling `MyClass().method1(5)` results in:

```
Calling method1 with args: (5,), kwargs: {}
method1 returned: 6
6
```"

You are tasked with creating a class decorator that measures the execution time of methods in a class. The decorator should only apply to instance methods that return integers, ensuring that it does not interfere with other types of methods.

Here's an example usage:

```python
@time_int_methods
class Example:
    def method1(self):
        return 42

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)
        return 100

    def method3(self):
        return ""Not an integer""
```

When `Example().method1()` is called, it should return 42 and print the execution time. However, calling `Example().method3()` should raise a TypeError.

Which of the following is a possible implementation of the `time_int_methods` decorator?

A) Using a class-based decorator:

```python
class TimeIntMethods:
    def __init__(self, cls):
        self.cls = cls

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        new_class = type(self.cls.__name__, (self.cls,), {})
        for name, method in self.cls.__dict__.items():
            if callable(method) and isinstance(method, int):
                setattr(new_class, name, self.time_int_method(method))
        return new_class

    def time_int_method(self, method):

        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = method(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            if not isinstance(result, int):
                raise TypeError(""Only integer methods are allowed"")
            print(f""Execution time of {method.__name__}: {end_time - start_time} seconds"")
            return result
        return wrapper
```

B) Using a function-based decorator:

```python
def time_int_methods(cls):
    new_class = type(cls.__name__, (cls,), {})
    for name, method in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(method) and isinstance(method, int):

    def __init__(self, cls):
        self.cls = cls

            return result
        return wrapper

D) Using a function-based decorator but incorrectly checking method type:

```python
def time_int_methods(cls):
    new_class = type(cls.__name__, (cls,), {})
    for name, method in cls.__dict__.items():

        print(f""Execution time of {method.__name__}: {end_time - start_time} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper
```";"A) Using a class-based decorator is correct because it properly handles the creation of a new class with the decorated methods, ensuring that only integer-returning methods are timed and validated. The function-based decorators in options B, C, and D incorrectly check whether the method is an instance of `int`, which will never be true since methods are not instances of integers."

A) Creating class MyClass  
Decorator called  

**Explanation:** 

The `MyClass` is decorated with `my_decorator`, and the metaclass of `MyClass` is `Meta`. The `__new__` method of the metaclass `Meta` gets called when `MyClass` is created, printing ""Creating class MyClass"". Then, the decorator `my_decorator` wraps the `__init__` method of `MyClass`, printing ""Decorator called"" every time an instance of `MyClass` is created. The order of operations here is first the metaclass creation and then the decoration, so the correct output is ""Creating class MyClass"" followed by ""Decorator called"".";"Answer format error.

D) Using `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` inside the decorator might lead to inaccurate timing due to context switching.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator does not handle exceptions that might be raised by the function it decorates.

Explanation:
The provided implementation of `async_time_decorator` is correct in terms of measuring the execution time for asynchronous functions. However, a potential issue with this approach is that it does not handle exceptions that might be raised during the execution of the decorated function. If an exception occurs inside the decorated function, the decorator will catch it and print a message indicating the time taken to execute (which would be 0 since no time has passed), but the original exception will be lost. A more robust solution would be to handle exceptions appropriately or pass them up to the caller:

```python
import asyncio

A) The `ResourceMeta` metaclass ensures that any subclass of `DataProcessor` must define a `resource_name`.

B) The `managed_resource` context manager will create and release a new instance of `Resource` every time it's used.

C) The `DataProcessor.process` method can be called without defining the `resource_name` in a subclass, as long as no resource is managed inside it.

D) The `Resource` class releases its resources automatically when garbage collected, regardless of whether it was managed by the context manager.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) This statement is true. The `ResourceMeta` metaclass checks for the presence of `resource_name` in any subclass of `DataProcessor`, ensuring that all subclasses define this attribute.

B) This statement is false. The `managed_resource` context manager creates and releases a new instance of `Resource` every time it's used within a `with` block, but it does not automatically create a new instance when called outside a `with` block.

C) This statement is false. If the `resource_name` is not defined in a subclass, an error will be raised during class creation due to the metaclass constraint enforced by `ResourceMeta`.

D) This statement is false. The `Resource` class does not release its resources automatically when garbage collected. Instead, it provides a method (`release`) that must be called explicitly to free up resources.";"**Detailed Explanation:**

- **A)** The metaclass ensures that all subclasses of `DataProcessor` are aware of the resource management protocol by requiring them to define a `resource_name`. This is a critical aspect for ensuring consistent behavior across different parts of an application when managing resources.
  
- **B)** The context manager is designed to handle the creation and cleanup of resources automatically within a `with` block. However, it does not create a new instance outside of this context, as its primary purpose is to manage resource lifecycle during execution.

- **C)** This statement misinterprets the role of the metaclass constraint. If the `resource_name` is missing, the subclass will not be created due to the error raised by `ResourceMeta`.

- **D)** Garbage collection in Python is designed to reclaim memory automatically when objects are no longer referenced. The `Resource` class provides a way to explicitly release resources, but it does not rely on garbage collection for resource management."

A) The method is added at runtime when an instance of `MyClass` is created.
B) The method is added at class definition time due to the metaclass's `__new__` method.
C) The method is added when an instance of a subclass of `MyClass` is created.
D) The method is not added, and `dynamic_method` will raise an AttributeError.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

B) The method is added at class definition time due to the metaclass's `__new__` method.

Explanation: In Python, when a class is defined using a metaclass, the metaclass’s `__new__` method is invoked to create the class object. In this case, the `DynamicMethodMeta.__new__` method adds the `dynamic_method` function directly to the dictionary of the class being created (`dct`).

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]  
**Part 2 (Answer):**

D) TypeError: Greeter must implement greet method

Explanation:

- The `Meta` metaclass checks if the `greet` method is implemented in any class that uses it. Since `Greeter` and `FriendlyGreeter` do not have a `greet` method, they would raise a `TypeError`. However, due to the decorator `@greet_decorator`, `Greeter` gets an additional `greet` method that prints ""Greetings!"" before calling the original `greet` method.
- The `WelcomeGreeter` class uses both the metaclass and the decorator. When `WelcomeGreeter` is instantiated, the `Meta` metaclass checks for the presence of a `greet` method, which does not exist in this case. Therefore, it raises a `TypeError`.
- Since the metaclass check fails before the decorator can be applied to `WelcomeGreeter`, option B and C cannot be correct.
- Option A is incorrect because all classes have the `greet` method due to the decorator.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior of this code when executed?

A) The `handle` method will be called synchronously, and it will block other tasks.

B) The `async_handle` method will be called asynchronously, but it will still block other tasks due to the use of `print`.

C) The `async_handle` method will run concurrently with other tasks thanks to asyncio's event loop.

D) The code will raise an error because `handle` cannot be made asynchronous using this metaclass.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct Answer: C) The `async_handle` method will run concurrently with other tasks thanks to asyncio's event loop.**

**Explanation:** 
The use of a metaclass (`AsyncHandlerMeta`) that converts an instance method `handle` into a static method `async_handle` is crucial here. This allows the original `handle` method, which was designed to be asynchronous (using `await`), to be called without needing to instantiate the class first. The metaclass transformation enables `async_handle` to be used as a regular coroutine within `main`, allowing other tasks (`task2`) to run concurrently due to asyncio's non-blocking nature. This demonstrates a practical use of metaclasses in enhancing the usability and flexibility of asynchronous methods."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator for logging method calls with their arguments:

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_method_calls(cls):
    for attr_name, attr_value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith('__'):
            setattr(cls, attr_name, wraps(attr_value)(log_call))
    return cls

def log_call(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f""Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f""{func.__name__} returned {result}"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_method_calls
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b
```

What potential issues could arise from this implementation of the `log_method_calls` decorator? Which option correctly identifies the main problem?

A) The decorator does not preserve the metadata of the original methods.

B) Calling an instance method will cause infinite recursion due to incorrect method binding.

C) It won't work with class methods or static methods, as they are bound differently.

D) The logging functionality can be disabled by simply removing the `@log_method_calls` decorator from the class definition.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) Calling an instance method will cause infinite recursion due to incorrect method binding.

Explanation: The current implementation of `log_method_calls` uses a loop to modify all callable attributes in the class. However, it does not correctly bind the logged methods back to their instances when called as instance methods. This leads to infinite recursion because each call to an instance method will attempt to log itself again and again, without resolving to the actual method implementation. To fix this, one would need to ensure that the wrapped methods are properly bound to instances using `method.__get__(self, cls)`."
"2025-07-04 08:02";"**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

    def connect(self):
        print(""Connecting to database..."")

# Example usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

Now, imagine you have a class `LoggingMeta` that logs the creation of instances. Modify the existing code to incorporate this new metaclass in a way that it seamlessly integrates with the `SingletonMeta` and respects the singleton pattern.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B.

Explanation: The task requires creating a metaclass that combines the functionality of both `SingletonMeta` and `LoggingMeta`. To achieve this, we need to ensure that the new metaclass inherits from both metaclasses. Here's how you can do it:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, dct):
        print(f""Creating class {name}"")
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, dct)

class DatabaseConnection(metaclass=SingletonMeta | LoggingMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print(""Connecting to database..."")

# Example usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

In this solution:
- We use Python's type hinting feature with `|` (pipe symbol, which is the bitwise OR operator in Python 3.10+). This syntax allows us to specify that `DatabaseConnection` should have the metaclass behavior of both `SingletonMeta` and `LoggingMeta`.
- The `__new__` method of `LoggingMeta` logs the creation of each class.
- When creating an instance of `DatabaseConnection`, both the singleton pattern and logging are respected."
"2025-07-04 16:01";"Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure that all instances of a class have unique names. However, there's a flaw in this implementation that could lead to unexpected behavior.

```python
class UniqueNameMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls.__name__ not in UniqueNameMeta._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            UniqueNameMeta._instances[cls.__name__] = instance

        self.name = name

# Example usage:
obj1 = MyClass(""Alice"")
obj2 = MyClass(""Alice"")

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Expected: False
```

Which of the following options correctly identifies and fixes the flaw in the provided code?

A) The `__call__` method should use `cls.name` instead of `cls.__name__` to ensure uniqueness.

B) A dictionary key collision might occur if two classes with the same name but different module names are created.

C) The metaclass should not store instances in a class variable `_instances`.

D) The code is correct as it already ensures that all instances have unique names.";"Part 2 (Answer):
B) A dictionary key collision might occur if two classes with the same name but different module names are created.

**Explanation**: The provided metaclass `UniqueNameMeta` uses the class's `__name__` attribute to store instances in a class variable `_instances`. This approach will cause a collision if two classes with the same name exist in different modules. For example, if you have `MyClass` in both `module1.py` and `module2.py`, they would be considered the same class by the metaclass, leading to incorrect behavior where instances of these ""same"" classes overwrite each other in the `_instances` dictionary."

```

What will be the output of this script when executed?

A) `Processed: Data fetched`
B) `Data fetched`
C) The program will hang indefinitely
D) An error will be thrown";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is A) `Processed: Data fetched`.

Explanation:

1. **Async Function `fetch_data`:**
   - This function simulates an asynchronous operation using `asyncio.sleep(1)` which suspends the execution for 1 second and then returns a string ""Data fetched"".

2. **Class `AsyncDecorator`:**
   - This class is designed to be used as a decorator to modify the behavior of async functions.
   - The `__init__` method takes an async function (`func`) as an argument and stores it.
   - The `__call__` method is defined to accept any number of positional arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).
   - Inside the `__call__` method, the async function is awaited, and then a string ""Processed: "" is prepended to the result.

3. **Decorator Application:**
   - The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator is applied to the `process_data` coroutine.
   - When `process_data` is called inside the `main` coroutine, it passes through the `AsyncDecorator`, which awaits the original `fetch_data` function and prepends ""Processed: "" to its result.

4. **Execution of `main`:**
   - The `asyncio.run(main())` statement runs the `main` coroutine, which in turn calls `process_data`.
   - Since `process_data` is decorated with `AsyncDecorator`, it first processes the data by prepending ""Processed: "" and then prints the result.

Therefore, the output of the script will be:
```
Processed: Data fetched
```"
"2025-07-05 08:02";"[QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a caching mechanism in Python that can be applied to any function. The cache should store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

Implement this caching mechanism as a decorator that can be applied to any function, using a metaclass to ensure that it works across different classes. Your solution should handle varying numbers of arguments and keyword arguments.

Here's a starting point for your implementation:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from functools import wraps

# Define the CacheMetaclass here
class CacheMetaclass(type):
    pass

# Define the caching decorator using CacheMetaclass
def cache(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        pass  # Your caching logic here
    return wrapper

# Example usage:
@cache
def expensive_function(x, y):
    print(""Computing..."")
    return x + y

# Create a class that uses the CacheMetaclass and applies the cache decorator
class CachingClass(metaclass=CacheMetaclass):
    @cache
    def compute(self, a, b):
        print(""Computing in class method..."")
        return a * b

# Test the implementation
print(expensive_function(2, 3))  # Should print ""Computing..."" and then return 5
print(expensive_function(2, 3))  # Should return 5 without recomputing
instance = CachingClass()
print(instance.compute(4, 5))  # Should print ""Computing in class method..."" and then return 20
print(instance.compute(4, 5))  # Should return 20 without recomputing";"[ANSWER] A

Explanation:
The correct answer is A. The provided solution uses a metaclass to ensure that the caching mechanism works across different classes and functions. It also correctly implements a caching decorator using `functools.wraps` for preserving the function's metadata.

To achieve this, you would define a `CacheMetaclass` as a subclass of `type`, which is used to create new types (classes). The `cache` decorator is then defined to handle caching logic. When applied to a function or method using the `@cache` syntax, it will store results based on the function's arguments and return cached results when the same inputs occur again.

The example usage demonstrates that the cache works correctly for both standalone functions and methods within a class, storing and returning computed values without recomputation when called with the same arguments."

B) The `greet` method will be added only to `MyClass` and not to `AnotherClass` or any subclasses.

C) The `greet` method will be added to all classes that inherit from `AnotherClass`, including `MyClass`.

D) The `greet` method will be added to `MyClass` but not to `AnotherClass`, unless explicitly defined in `AnotherClass`.";"### Part 2: Answer

A) The `greet` method will be added to both `MyClass` and `AnotherClass`, but not to any subclass of `AnotherClass`.

Explanation:
- In Python, metaclasses are used to create classes, and they can modify the class being created. In this case, the `Meta` metaclass adds a `greet` method to any class that uses it as their metaclass.
- When `MyClass` is defined with `metaclass=Meta`, the metaclass `Meta` modifies `MyClass` by adding the `greet` method.
- Similarly, when `AnotherClass` inherits from both `Meta` and `MyClass`, it also inherits the `greet` method because `MyClass` already has it due to being modified by `Meta`.
- However, any subclass of `AnotherClass` will not have the `greet` method unless explicitly defined in that subclass. This is because `AnotherClass` does not inherit from a metaclass that adds `greet`, only from `MyClass`."

A) The `MyClass` will not be decorated because decorators cannot be applied to classes.
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print: ""Initializing MyClass with args: (1, 2), kwargs: {}"".

D) An AttributeError will occur when trying to create an instance of `MyClass`.";"Part 2 (Answer): B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print: ""Initializing MyClass with args: (1, 2), kwargs: {}"".

Explanation: The decorator `debug_class` wraps the original `__init__` method of `MyClass`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the modified `__init__` method is called, which first prints debug information and then calls the original `__init__` method. Therefore, when you create an instance with arguments (1, 2), it will output the specified message followed by initializing the class attributes."

What is the primary issue with this code, and how would you correct it to ensure that `fetch_data` runs asynchronously as intended?

A) The `AsyncDecorator` should use `async def` instead of `def`.

C) `await asyncio.sleep(1)` is unnecessary in the decorator.
D) The `main` function needs to be decorated with `@asyncio.coroutine`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The `AsyncDecorator` does not handle asynchronous functions correctly.

The issue lies in how the `AsyncDecorator` is applied to an asynchronous function. When a function is marked as async, it returns a coroutine object that must be awaited to execute. However, the current implementation of the decorator tries to run the coroutine using `run_until_complete`, which blocks the event loop rather than allowing other tasks to run concurrently.

To correct this, you should either modify the decorator to return the coroutine directly and let the caller decide when to run it, or refactor the code to use async/await more effectively.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

**Question:** Why is `obj.new_attr` not being set to `""default_value""` as intended? What can be done to fix this issue?

A) The metaclass is not correctly adding the attribute because it is being called before any attributes are defined in the class.
B) The metaclass is incorrectly overriding an existing attribute with the same name, but there isn't one.
C) The attribute assignment should happen during the initialization of each instance instead of during the class creation.

**A) The metaclass is not correctly adding the attribute because it is being called before any attributes are defined in the class.**

This option is incorrect because the metaclass is actually trying to add `new_attr` when no other attributes exist, which is its intended behavior.

**B) The metaclass is incorrectly overriding an existing attribute with the same name, but there isn't one.**

This option is also incorrect for the same reason as A; there is no conflicting attribute in this case.

**C) The attribute assignment should happen during the initialization of each instance instead of during the class creation.**

This option is correct. The issue arises because the metaclass adds `new_attr` when the class is created, but if an instance-specific value needs to be set, it must be done during the initialization of that instance.

**D) There is no issue; `obj.new_attr` will be set to `""default_value""` after running this code.**

This option is incorrect because, as explained in option C, the attribute assignment should happen during instance creation, not class creation.

The correct fix involves ensuring that any additional attributes are assigned within an `__init__` method if they need to vary per instance or conditionally."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class with a custom behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'x' not in dct:
            dct['x'] = 0

A) 0  
B) 1  
C) AttributeError: 'SubClass' object has no attribute 'x'  
D) TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'dct'";"A) 0

The metaclass `Meta` ensures that any class created with it will have an attribute `x` initialized to 0. When `SubClass` is defined, it inherits from `MyClass`, which uses the `Meta` metaclass. Therefore, `SubClass` will also have the attribute `x` set to 0."

D) Task started

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Task started  
   Decorated task completed  
   Task completed  

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is A. The `TaskDecorator` class can be used to decorate both regular synchronous functions and asynchronous coroutines in Python. When you use the decorator on an async function, it simply calls the original function without any modification since the decorator does not perform any actions that would conflict with the async nature of the coroutine.

The output will be:

```
Task started
Decorated task completed
Task completed

A) Using resource  
B) Resource acquired  
C) Resource released  
D) Error";"C) Resource released

Explanation: When `use_resource()` is called, it enters a context manager by using the `with` statement. The `managed_resource` decorator wraps around the generator function `acquire_resource`, which yields ""resource"". When control leaves the `with` block, the context manager's `__exit__` method is called, which in turn calls `release_resource(resource)`. Therefore, ""Resource released"" will be printed after ""Using resource"". The generator itself does not contribute to any output outside of its yield statement."

Explanation: In the given code, the `wrapper` function returns an instance of the new class type created by `type(cls.__name__, (cls,), {})`, which is essentially a subclass of the original class. However, it does not properly inherit from the original class in the way that decorators are supposed to work.

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class. However, it doesn't fully prevent multiple instances from being created when used in certain ways. Your task is to modify the metaclass or add another mechanism to ensure true singularity.

    _instances = {}

print(s1 is s2)  # Should ideally print True but might not due to certain issues with metaclasses
```

What could be improved in the `SingletonMeta` class or an additional approach that would ensure true singularity of the `Singleton` class?

A) Ensure that `__new__` is overridden instead of `__call__`.

B) Use a lock to synchronize access to `_instances` dictionary.

C) Store instances in a global dictionary outside the metaclass.

D) Implement `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__` methods to prevent copying of singleton instances.";"Part 2 (Answer):
B) Use a lock to synchronize access to `_instances` dictionary.

Explanation:
The current implementation of the `SingletonMeta` class uses `__call__`, which can lead to race conditions when multiple threads try to create an instance simultaneously. By using a lock, we ensure that only one thread can execute the creation logic at a time, thus preventing the creation of multiple instances even in multi-threaded environments.

Here's how you could modify the code:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock = threading.Lock()

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
                cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # This will correctly print True
```

Option A is incorrect because `__new__` should not be used in this context as it bypasses the `__call__` mechanism which is crucial for metaclass-based singletons.

Option C is generally considered bad practice and can lead to memory leaks or other issues.

Option D is not relevant to ensuring singularity of a class; it's more about object copying, which doesn't affect the singleton pattern directly."

C. Calling add with args: (3,), kwargs: {value: None}
D. Error";"B. Calling add with args: (2,), kwargs: {value: 3}

Explanation: The decorator `@add(2)` attempts to log the call to the `add` function with the provided arguments. However, since the method `add_to_result` is decorated and does not have explicit positional or keyword parameters, the argument `2` passed to `@add(2)` does not directly affect how `add` is called within `add_to_result`. The actual call to `add` from `add_to_result` uses the default value of `None` for its second parameter because no arguments were explicitly passed.

What will be the output of the code when executed?

A) One second has passed
B) Timer ended in 0.5 seconds
C) Timer ended in 2.0 seconds
D) Timer ended in 3.0 seconds

Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is D) Timer ended in 3.0 seconds.

Explanation:
When the `AsyncTimer` context manager is entered, it records the start time using `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()`. The coroutine inside the `with` block then sleeps for 1 second twice, totaling 2 seconds of sleep. However, the total execution time from when the context manager is entered to when it's exited includes these sleep durations plus the time taken by the `__aexit__` method to calculate and print the elapsed time.

The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time as follows:
- Start time: Recorded at the beginning of the context manager.
- End time: When the coroutine inside the block finishes executing.
- Elapsed time: Difference between end time and start time, which is 2 seconds (sleep durations) plus the negligible time taken by `__aexit__` itself.

Thus, when the output is printed, it shows ""Timer ended in 3.0 seconds,"" indicating that the total execution time includes both sleep durations."

A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.
B) The print statement inside the wrapper function is not thread-safe.
C) The decorator incorrectly calculates the execution time due to overlapping times.
D) The `wrapper` function returns a coroutine instead of the result.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The decorator incorrectly calculates the execution time due to overlapping times.

Explanation: The issue arises because each call to `compute_sum(1000000)` within another iterable context does not re-run the `timing_decorator`. Instead, it uses the same timing information from the first run of the function. This leads to incorrect and overlapping timing results. To fix this, ensure that the decorator measures execution time independently for each call, possibly by moving the print statement inside the wrapper's conditional block or using a different approach to measure time in each iteration.";"Answer format error.

D) The instance will be created successfully with invalid data.";"A) The metaclass will raise a `TypeError`, preventing the creation of the instance.

Explanation:
When you attempt to create an instance of the `User` class with invalid data, the metaclass `ValidateMeta` checks if the subclass implements the `validate_data` method during the class creation. Since the `User` class does implement this method and the validation logic correctly raises a `ValueError`, the metaclass does not raise any errors. However, when an instance of `User` is created with invalid data (non-string name or age outside the valid range), the `validate_data` method will indeed raise a `ValueError`. But since this error occurs at runtime during the initialization of the instance, the `TypeError` from the metaclass is raised before reaching the `validate_data` call.

# Actual output (varies depending on the system): 
# compute_sum(1000000) took -1.0 seconds to execute.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A: The issue is that `time.time()` returns a floating-point number of seconds since the epoch, not an integer. Printing `-1.0` seconds to execute suggests an error in capturing the end time correctly.

Correct answer: B

Explanation:
The problem lies in how the timing is calculated. When calculating the duration, it's crucial to subtract the start time from the end time accurately. The code currently calculates `end_time - start_time` but does not ensure that both times are correctly captured. In some cases, especially under heavy load or on slower systems, this might lead to negative durations which don't make sense in a real-world scenario.

To fix the issue, we should ensure that the timing calculation is done correctly. Here's how you can correct it:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()  # Capture the start time before calling the function
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()  # Capture the end time after the function has executed
        print(f""{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds to execute."")
        return result

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

# Expected output:
# compute_sum(1000000) took 0.0023456789012345678 seconds to execute.

Option A is incorrect because it suggests uniqueness based on the object's identity rather than its class. Option C is not directly supported by this pattern, as it only ensures per-class uniqueness.

Explanation: 
The Singleton class is designed to ensure that only one instance of the class can exist. In this implementation, the `__new__` method uses a lock to synchronize access, ensuring thread safety when creating instances. When multiple threads attempt to create an instance simultaneously, only one will succeed due to the lock.

In the main block, a single instance of `Singleton` is created and then passed to 10 threads, each of which calls `thread_task`. Since all threads are passed the same instance of `Singleton`, they will print the same memory address (ID) for this instance. Therefore, the output will be the same thread ID printed 10 times."

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to track the execution time of functions. Your task is to modify this code so that it also tracks the number of times each function has been called.

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute."")
        return result

@timer
def expensive_function():
    for i in range(1000000):
        pass

# Call the function a few times
for _ in range(3):
    expensive_function()
```

Which of the following modifications should be made to `timer` to track both execution time and call count?

A) Add a counter dictionary inside the wrapper and increment it each time the function is called.

B) Use a closure to maintain a separate counter for each decorated function.

C) Introduce a global variable that increments each time any function decorated by `timer` is called.

D) Modify the decorator to use a context manager instead of a function wrapper.";"### Part 2 (Answer):
**B)** Use a closure to maintain a separate counter for each decorated function.

Explanation:
- The original `timer` decorator wraps a function and prints its execution time. To track how many times the function has been called, we need a way to keep track of this count separately for each function.
- A closure (an inner function that captures variables from an enclosing scope) allows us to maintain state between function calls without using global variables or classes.
- By creating a counter inside the `wrapper` function and incrementing it every time the function is called, we can achieve our goal of tracking both execution time and call count. This approach ensures that each decorated function maintains its own independent count of how many times it has been invoked."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method `greet` to any class it decorates. The goal is to understand how this works under the hood and what implications it might have on memory management.

```python
class Greeter(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f""Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}!""

class MyClass(metaclass=Greeter):
    pass

# Usage
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.greet())
```

What is the output of this code, and what does it demonstrate about how metaclasses interact with class creation?

A) `Hello from MyClass!` - Demonstrates that metaclasses can dynamically add methods to classes.

B) `AttributeError` - Indicates that adding a method dynamically via a metaclass is not possible in Python.

C) `None` - Shows that metaclasses do not modify existing classes but rather create new ones.

D) Memory error due to excessive memory usage during class creation.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

"2025-07-14 08:02";"Part 1 (Question):

You are tasked with creating a context manager that measures the execution time of any block of code within its `with` statement. Your goal is to ensure that the context manager properly handles exceptions thrown within the block, without allowing them to propagate outside the context manager.

Below is a partial implementation of such a context manager using a decorator and a context manager:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Execution took {end_time - start_time} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimingContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Execution took {end_time - self.start_time} seconds"")
```

However, this implementation does not handle exceptions thrown within the `with` block correctly. Your task is to modify the `__exit__` method of the `TimingContextManager` class so that it properly handles any exceptions thrown within the `with` block.

Which of the following modifications should be made to the `__exit__` method to achieve the desired behavior?

A) Remove the print statement inside the `__exit__` method

B) Call `super().__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)` at the beginning of the `__exit__` method

C) Check if `exc_type` is `None`, and if not, re-raise the exception using `raise exc_val from None`

D) Add a finally block that handles any exceptions thrown within the block";"Part 2 (Answer):

A) Remove the print statement inside the `__exit__` method
This option would remove the functionality of printing the execution time, but it does not address the handling of exceptions.

B) Call `super().__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)` at the beginning of the `__exit__` method
This option is incorrect because there is no superclass for a context manager in Python, and calling `super().__exit__()` would result in an AttributeError.

C) Check if `exc_type` is `None`, and if not, re-raise the exception using `raise exc_val from None`
This option correctly handles exceptions thrown within the `with` block. If an exception occurs, it will be re-raised after printing the execution time, preserving the original traceback information.

D) Add a finally block that handles any exceptions thrown within the block
Adding a finally block would not address the issue of handling exceptions properly. The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, so it cannot be used to catch and handle exceptions that occur within the `with` block.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) Check if `exc_type` is `None`, and if not, re-raise the exception using `raise exc_val from None`."

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to control attribute creation in a class:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'x' not in dct:

Which of the following statements about `MyClass` is true?

A) `MyClass` can be instantiated without any issues.
B) Attempting to instantiate `MyClass` will raise a `TypeError`.
C) `MyClass` inherits from the `Meta` class.
D) The `x` attribute in `MyClass` can be modified after instantiation.";"B) Attempting to instantiate `MyClass` will raise a `TypeError`.

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks during the creation of any subclass whether it contains an attribute named 'x'. If not, it raises a `TypeError`. Since `MyClass` explicitly defines `x = 10`, creating an instance of `MyClass` would not trigger the error. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option C is not true because metaclasses inherit from `type`, not the other way around. Option D is incorrect as attributes defined in a class cannot be modified after instantiation in Python (except for mutable data types)."

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `thread_safe` decorator will ensure that the `increment` method is thread-safe.
B) The final printed value of `counter.value` will always be 2000.
C) The `thread_safe` decorator modifies the class `Counter` to include a lock for each instance, not just the class.
D) None of the above.";"A) This statement is incorrect because while the decorator adds a lock to the class, it does not ensure that each method in the class uses this lock. The `increment` method itself must be thread-safe.

B) This statement is also incorrect. Due to race conditions, even with locking around each increment operation, the final printed value of `Counter().value` will likely be less than 2000 due to the non-atomic nature of the increment operation.

C) This statement is correct. The `thread_safe` decorator modifies the `__init__` method to add a lock for each instance created from the decorated class, ensuring that each instance can safely handle concurrent access.

D) Since option C is correct, this statement is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The `thread_safe` decorator modifies the class `Counter` to include a lock for each instance, not just the class."

Which of the following statements is true about the `MyTimer` class and its usage?

A) The `MyTimer` class can only be used once per instance.

B) The `start` method will raise an exception if it's called more than once on the same instance.

C) The `stop` method will ensure that the timer coroutine is fully cancelled and no further ticks are printed even if called multiple times.

D) The `run` method runs indefinitely until manually stopped, but calling `start` multiple times creates new timers without cancelling existing ones.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The `stop` method will ensure that the timer coroutine is fully cancelled and no further ticks are printed even if called multiple times.

Explanation:
- In the provided code, the `MyTimer` class has an asynchronous method `run` that prints a tick every interval.
- The `start` method creates a new task to run this coroutine in the background.
- The `stop` method cancels the task using `self.task.cancel()`, and it handles the cancellation by catching `asyncio.CancelledError`. This ensures that any remaining ticks are not printed, making the timer fully stopped.
- Option A is incorrect because instances of `MyTimer` can be reused multiple times without issues.
- Option B is incorrect because calling `start` more than once will indeed create new tasks without cancelling existing ones, which means there could be multiple timers running concurrently.
- Option D is partly correct in that the coroutine runs indefinitely until stopped, but it doesn't handle multiple start calls or ensure full cancellation of the timer as described in option C."

# Example usage:
user1 = User(""Alice"")
user2 = User(""Bob"")
print(user1 is user2)  # Should print True if the metaclass works correctly
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes how the `UniqueIdentifierMeta` metaclass ensures that all instances of a subclass of `UniqueID` have unique identifiers?

A) It uses a class variable `_instances` to store instances, ensuring each identifier is used only once.

B) It overrides the `__new__` method to create a new instance and add it to the `_instances` dictionary.

C) It overrides the `__call__` method to check if an instance with the same identifier already exists; if so, it returns the existing instance, otherwise, it creates a new one.

D) It uses a static method to register each instance when it is created and checks for duplicates in the `_instances` dictionary before allowing a new instance.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) It overrides the `__call__` method to check if an instance with the same identifier already exists; if so, it returns the existing instance, otherwise, it creates a new one.

Explanation: The `UniqueIdentifierMeta` metaclass overrides the `__call__` method. This special method is called when an instance of the metaclass is invoked as a function (i.e., when a class is instantiated). The `__call__` method checks if there's already an instance with the same identifier in the `_instances` dictionary. If such an instance exists, it returns that existing instance instead of creating a new one. This ensures that all instances of subclasses of `UniqueID` have unique identifiers, as required by the abstract method `identifier`.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

You are tasked with creating a Python context manager that logs both the entry and exit of a block, but also measures the time taken for execution. The logger should be able to handle any block of code wrapped within it.

Here's a partial implementation of such a context manager:

```python
import time

class TimedContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        # BEGIN SOLUTION

# Example usage:
with TimedContextManager() as entry_message:

What should go in the `__enter__` method to ensure that both the entry and exit logging are handled correctly?

A) `return ""Entry logged""`<br>
B) `print(""Entry logged"")`<br>
C) `raise Exception(""Entry logged"")`<br>
D) `yield ""Entry logged""`";"[ANSWER] B)<br>

**Explanation**: The correct answer is `print(""Entry logged"")`. This ensures that when the context manager's block of code enters, it logs a message to indicate entry. However, the example usage expects the result of `__enter__` to be returned as the value of the variable used in the `with` statement. Therefore, simply logging ""Entry"" is insufficient; we need to print it, but not return it from `__enter__`. Options A, C, and D either fail to log correctly or handle exceptions incorrectly, making them incorrect choices."

D) The decorator `log_and_time` modifies the behavior of `my_function` by changing its signature.";"Part 2 (Answer):
B) The decorator `log_and_time` will fail to execute if `my_function` raises an exception.

Explanation: While the decorator does correctly log the execution time for a successful call, it fails to handle exceptions raised within the function. If `my_function` throws an exception during its execution, the code inside the `wrapper` function following the call to `func(*args, **kwargs)` will not execute, meaning the time taken to run the function will not be logged and the program will terminate without completing the decorator's logging functionality. Therefore, option B is correct as it accurately reflects a limitation of the provided decorator implementation."

B) Fetching data... Waiting for data to be fetched... Processing data... Processed Data

**Explanation:**
The code creates a task to fetch data using `asyncio.create_task(fetch_data())`. The main function then enters a loop where it prints ""Waiting for data to be fetched..."" every 0.5 seconds until the task is done. Once the task completes, fetching the data, the main function proceeds to process the data by calling `await process_data(data)`, which results in ""Processing data... Processed Data"".

A) TypeError: Class must implement method  
B) Original method  
C) Decorated! Original method  
D) Decorated!";"Part 2 (Answer):

**Answer:** C) Decorated! Original method

**Explanation:** The code defines a metaclass `Meta` that checks if the class it's applied to has a method named `method`. If not, it raises a TypeError. The decorator `class_decorator` wraps the original method with an additional print statement. When we instantiate `MyClass()`, the metaclass ensures that `MyClass` implements `method`, and then the decorator modifies this method to include a decoration message before calling the original method. Therefore, when `obj.method()` is called, it outputs ""Decorated!"" followed by the output of the original method, which is ""Original method""."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class decorator. The goal is to add a method to any class decorated by this metaclass that prints ""Hello, World!"" when called.

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        super().__init__(name, bases, dct)
        cls.greet = lambda self: print(""Hello, World!"")

    pass

# Usage
my_instance = MyClass()
my_instance.greet()  # Expected output: Hello, World!
```

Which of the following statements is true about the code above?

A) The `greet` method is added to `MyClass` dynamically at runtime.

B) The `Meta` metaclass does not modify `MyClass` in any way.

C) Calling `my_instance.greet()` will raise an AttributeError because `greet` is not defined in `MyClass`.

D) The code will not run because there is a syntax error in the `Meta` class definition.";"A) The `greet` method is added to `MyClass` dynamically at runtime.

Explanation: 
- When `MyClass` is decorated with `@Meta()`, the metaclass `Meta` is invoked. 
- In the `__init__` method of `Meta`, a new method `greet` is added to the class `cls` being initialized (which in this case is `MyClass`).
- This allows instances of `MyClass` to call the `greet` method, which prints ""Hello, World!"".
- The other options are incorrect because:
  - Option B is false because the metaclass does add a method to the class.
  - Option C is false because the `greet` method is defined and can be called.
  - Option D is false as there are no syntax errors in the provided code."

C) The `my_async_function` is executed synchronously and will block the event loop.
D) All of the above.";"A) The `AsyncMeta` metaclass adds a new method to instances of `MyClass`.

Explanation:

- When calling `obj.async_method()`, it will indeed print ""Instance <__main__.MyClass object at 0x...> has been created"", where `<__main__.MyClass object at 0x...>` represents the memory address of the instance.
- The `my_async_function` is defined as an async method, which means it returns a coroutine when called.

Given this setup, which of the following statements is true about the performance measurement?

A) The `sync_function` will measure its execution time correctly when called.

B) The `async_task` inside the `AsyncTimer` context manager will not measure the correct execution time because it's asynchronous and not awaited properly.

C) Both `sync_function` and `async_task` are measured accurately due to the use of their respective decorators and context managers.

D) The `timer` decorator cannot be used to measure the execution time of asynchronous functions like `async_task`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Incorrect. While the `sync_function` is decorated with `@timer`, it measures its execution time correctly because it runs synchronously and completes before the timer ends.

B) Correct. The `async_task` inside the `AsyncTimer` context manager will not measure the correct execution time because it's asynchronous and not awaited properly. As a result, the end_time in `__exit__` is taken immediately after starting the timer, leading to an incorrect measurement of 0 seconds.

C) Incorrect. Although both `sync_function` and `async_task` are decorated with their respective timers, the async task inside `AsyncTimer` will not measure its execution time correctly due to the non-awaited nature of the task within the context manager.

D) Incorrect. The `timer` decorator can be used to measure the execution time of asynchronous functions like `async_task`, but it requires proper handling outside a context manager or by awaiting it properly if inside a decorator."

You are tasked with creating a caching mechanism in Python that can be applied to any function. The cache should store the results of the function calls based on their arguments and return those results when the same arguments are used again, thus avoiding redundant computations.

    """"""
    Decorator to cache results of a function based on its arguments.
    
    Args:
    func (callable): The function whose results need to be cached.

Which of the following statements about the `cache_results` decorator is true?

A) The decorator will cache results for all function calls, regardless of their arguments.
B) The decorator uses a dictionary named `cache` to store function results based on their arguments.
C) The decorator checks if the result for the current arguments is in a global variable `cached_values`.
D) The decorator does not use any additional variables or storage beyond what is necessary to cache function results.

Part 2 (Answer):
B) The decorator uses a dictionary named `cache` to store function results based on their arguments.

Explanation: The correct answer is B. The decorator defines an internal dictionary `cache` within the wrapper function to store the results of the function calls. This dictionary keys on a combination of positional and keyword arguments (`key = args + tuple(kwargs.items())`) to ensure that different sets of arguments lead to distinct cache entries."
"2025-07-21 08:02";"### Part 1 (Question)

**Question:**  
Consider the following code snippet that uses a decorator to modify the behavior of class methods. The goal is to log the arguments with which each method was called. However, the current implementation logs all arguments regardless of whether they are public or private. How can you modify this decorator so that it only logs public (non-private) method calls?

```python
def log_args(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f""Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    @log_args
    def public_method(self, a, b):
        return a + b
    
    @log_args
    def _private_method(self, x):
        return x * 2

# Example usage
my_instance = MyClass()
my_instance.public_method(1, 2)
my_instance._private_method(3)
```

**Options:**
A) Change the decorator to filter out private methods  
B) Use a class variable to track which methods are public  
C) Modify the wrapper to check if the method name starts with an underscore  
D) Implement a metaclass that applies different decorators based on method visibility";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**  
The decorator can be modified to log only public method calls by checking if the method name does not start with an underscore. This is because in Python, names starting with underscores are intended for internal use and should be treated as non-public. 

Here's how you can modify the `log_args` decorator to achieve this:

```python
def log_args(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if not func.__name__.startswith('_'):
            print(f""Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    @log_args
    def public_method(self, a, b):
        return a + b
    
    @log_args
    def _private_method(self, x):
        return x * 2

# Example usage
my_instance = MyClass()
my_instance.public_method(1, 2)  # This will print the log
my_instance._private_method(3)   # This will not print the log
```

This modification ensures that only public method calls are logged, as indicated by the check for non-private method names."

A) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, ""Something is happening before the function is called."" will be printed.
B) When an instance of `MyClass` calls `my_method`, ""Something is happening before my_method is called."" will be printed.

D) None of the above.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When an instance of `MyClass` calls `my_method`, ""Something is happening before my_method is called."" will be printed.

Explanation:
- The `MyMeta` metaclass intercepts class creation and checks if `my_method` exists in the class dictionary. If it does, it wraps the method with additional functionality that prints a message.
- The `my_decorator` decorator wraps any function it decorates with an additional print statement.
- When an instance of `MyClass` calls `my_method`, due to metaclass intervention, ""Something is happening before my_method is called."" is printed first. Then, the original `my_method` functionality (""my_method has been called."") is executed."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `thread_safe` decorator ensures that only one thread can execute `increment` at a time, preventing race conditions.

B) The `Counter` class uses a separate lock for each instance to ensure thread safety.

C) The use of the `lock` in `Counter` is redundant because `thread_safe` already provides locking.

D) The final value printed will always be 1000, demonstrating that threading has worked correctly.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `thread_safe` decorator ensures that only one thread can execute `increment` at a time, preventing race conditions.

**Explanation:** 

The `thread_safe` decorator is applied to the `increment` method of the `Counter` class. Inside this decorator, it uses a lock (`lock`) to ensure mutual exclusion when the `increment` method is called. This prevents multiple threads from entering the critical section (the block of code that modifies `self.value`) simultaneously, thus preventing race conditions where multiple increments could be combined into a single increment.

Option B is incorrect because each instance of the `Counter` class should use its own lock for mutual exclusion, but the decorator does not create new locks per instance; it uses a shared lock across all instances.

Option C is incorrect because although the `lock` in `Counter` might seem redundant due to the `thread_safe` decorator, the `lock` inside `Counter` could still be used independently or for additional synchronization mechanisms that are not covered by the `thread_safe` decorator.

Option D is incorrect because without proper synchronization (which this code provides with the `thread_safe` decorator), multiple threads could execute the `increment` method simultaneously, leading to an incorrect final value. The actual final value will depend on how well the synchronization is working and could be less than 1000 if race conditions are not completely prevented.";"Answer format error.

Consider the following Python code that uses decorators to modify class behavior. The goal is to create a decorator `@log_methods` that logs the method names as they are called on instances of any decorated class. However, there's a subtle issue in the implementation that causes it to not work correctly with asynchronous methods.

A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous methods correctly  
B) The logging function is not properly defined inside the decorator  
C) There's a naming conflict with Python’s built-in `log` function  
D) The instance method is incorrectly referenced inside the wrapper";"[ANSWER] A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous methods correctly

Explanation: The issue lies in how the decorator is trying to wrap both synchronous and asynchronous methods. The current implementation uses a simple `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs)` which assumes that the method is synchronous. As a result, when the asynchronous method (`my_async_method`) is called, it raises an error because the wrapper does not await the coroutine.

To fix this issue, you would need to modify the `wrap_method_with_log` function to check if the method is asynchronous and use `await method(*args, **kwargs)` instead of just calling it. This ensures that asynchronous methods are properly awaited and their names are logged correctly."

Explanation:
1. When `ServiceManager` is instantiated with `MyService`, the `__init__` method of `ServiceManager` creates an instance of `MyService`.
2. The `manage_service` coroutine in `ServiceManager` calls the `start` method on `self.service`. Since `MyService` implements a non-blocking `start` method, it successfully sets `self.running` to `True` and prints ""Service started"".
3. It then calls `check_status`, which returns ""Running"" because `self.running` is `True`.
4. After that, it calls the `stop` method on `self.service`. This method sets `self.running` back to `False` and prints ""Service stopped"".
5. Finally, it checks the status again with `check_status`, which now returns ""Stopped"" as `self.running` is `False`.

What does calling `obj.new_method()` do? Explain why and provide the output.

A) It raises an AttributeError because new_method is not defined in MyClass  
B) It returns 'New Method' because AddMethod adds the method dynamically at class creation time  
C) It throws a TypeError because new_method expects arguments  
D) It outputs the memory address of obj.new_method";"Part 2 (Answer): 
The correct answer is B: It returns 'New Method' because AddMethod adds the method dynamically at class creation time.

Explanation: The `AddMethod` metaclass defines a `__new__` method that takes three parameters: the metaclass itself (`cls`), the name of the new class (`name`), and a dictionary representing the namespace of the class (`dct`). Inside the `__new__` method, a lambda function is added to the `dct` under the key 'new_method'. This lambda function returns the string 'New Method' when called. Since this method is added during the creation of any class that uses `AddMethod`, it becomes available on instances of those classes as well.

Option A is incorrect because 'new_method' has been added to the class, so calling `obj.new_method()` will not raise an AttributeError.
Option C is incorrect because there are no arguments required for the lambda function we added.
Option D is incorrect because calling a method does not return its memory address; it executes the code and returns the result if any."

class MethodLogger(type):
    def __new__(cls, name: str, bases: tuple, dct: dict) -> Any:
        for key, value in dct.items():

```

Which of the following statements about this code snippet is true?

A) The metaclass `MethodLogger` correctly applies the decorator to all methods in the class `Calculator`.

B) The decorator defined within the metaclass is not correctly implemented and will not work as expected.

C) The metaclass `MethodLogger` should be applied at runtime using a class decorator instead of being used during class creation.

D) The method `add` will not execute because of an error in the implementation of the metaclass or the decorator.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The decorator defined within the metaclass is not correctly implemented and will not work as expected.

Explanation:
The issue with this code lies in how the methods are being replaced within the class dictionary. When a callable (method) is found, it is wrapped with the `_log_method` function. However, if the method has any attributes (like `__name__`, `__annotations__`, etc.), these will not be preserved in the wrapper function. As a result, when the method is called, Python's built-in methods like `__getattribute__` might not behave as expected due to the absence of these attributes in the wrapper function.

This example demonstrates why it's crucial to handle such details correctly when using metaclasses or class decorators to modify method behavior at the class level.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

B) `Custom log message`
C) An error, as 'log' method in BaseClass cannot be overridden
D) None

Part 2 (Answer):
B) `Custom log message`

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` defines a new class attribute `log` if it doesn't already exist. This attribute is set to a lambda function that returns a default logging string.
- When `ChildClass` is defined, the metaclass `Meta` checks if 'log' is in the dictionary of `ChildClass`. Since `ChildClass` explicitly defines its own `log` method, it overrides the one added by the metaclass.
- Therefore, when `get_log(child)` is called, it calls the overridden `log` method from `ChildClass`, which returns ""Custom log message""."

You are tasked with creating a metaclass that ensures all instances of a class have unique identifiers. The metaclass should also provide a method to retrieve the total number of unique instances created.

Here's the initial code structure:

```python

    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        # Ensure each instance has a unique identifier
        if cls not in cls._instances:

- When a class `MyClass` is defined with a metaclass `Meta`, the metaclass's `__init__` method gets called immediately upon class creation.
- The `@MyClass.register` decorator adds `AnotherClass` to the set of classes managed by `MyClass`. However, this registration happens after the `__init__` method of `Meta` has already executed for `MyClass`.
- Therefore, when you create an instance of `MyClass`, it will print ""Class MyClass is being created"" first. Then, because `AnotherClass` registers itself with `MyClass`, it prints ""Class AnotherClass is being registered"".

**Explanation:**  
The `greet_decorator` is intended to prepend ""Hello, World!"" to the output of any callable method in the class it decorates. However, when the lambda function captures `value`, it does so by reference rather than by value. As a result, all lambda functions point to the same `value`, which is the last method in the class (`say_hello`), because the loop continues until the last method's `value` is captured. When you call `g.say_hello()`, it executes the `say_hello` method, prints ""Goodbye, World!"", and then the lambda function (which now points to `say_hello`) adds ""Hello, World!"" to its output. Therefore, the correct output is ""Hello, World!\nGoodbye, World!""."

@singleton
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self, db_name):
        self.db_name = db_name
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `DatabaseConnection` class can have multiple instances because the singleton decorator does not enforce uniqueness.

B) When creating an instance of `DatabaseConnection`, the singleton decorator ensures that only one instance exists for any given class.

C) If you attempt to create two instances of `DatabaseConnection`, they will be created, but subsequent attempts to create another instance with different parameters will reuse the existing instance.

D) The `singleton` function can be used on functions as well as classes, and it will enforce a singleton pattern across all uses.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
B) When creating an instance of `DatabaseConnection`, the singleton decorator ensures that only one instance exists for any given class.

This is because the `singleton` decorator checks if an instance of the decorated class already exists in the `instances` dictionary. If it does, it returns that instance; otherwise, it creates a new instance and stores it in the dictionary. This pattern guarantees that no matter how many times you attempt to create an instance of `DatabaseConnection`, only one instance will be created and reused.";"Answer format error.

Part 1 (Question):
You are tasked with optimizing the performance of a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. The current implementation uses recursion, which is highly inefficient for large values of n due to repeated calculations. Your goal is to rewrite this function using an advanced Python concept to ensure it runs efficiently even for large inputs.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

Which of the following options correctly implements a more efficient Fibonacci function?

A) Using memoization with a decorator:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

B) Using a generator:

```python
def fibonacci_gen():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

fibonacci = lambda n: list(fibonacci_gen())[n]
```

C) Using an iterative approach:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```

D) Using multiprocessing to parallelize the calculation:

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        with Pool(processes=2) as pool:
            result = pool.apply_async(fibonacci, args=(n-1,))
            return result.get() + pool.apply_async(fibonacci, args=(n-2,)).get()
```

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]
Part 2 (Answer):
C) Using an iterative approach:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```

Explanation: The correct answer is C) using an iterative approach. This method has linear time complexity (O(n)) and constant space complexity (O(1)), making it highly efficient for calculating large Fibonacci numbers. It avoids the exponential time complexity (O(2^n)) associated with naive recursive solutions and eliminates the risk of stack overflow that could occur with deep recursion.";"Answer format error.

You are tasked with creating a class `AsyncTimer` that will manage asynchronous operations with timeouts. The class should have methods `start` and `stop`. When the timer is started, it should wait for a specified duration and then call a callback function. If the timer is stopped before expiration, it should cancel the operation.

Below is an incomplete implementation of the `AsyncTimer` class:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, timeout):
        self.timeout = timeout
        self._task = None

    async def start(self, callback):
        # Your implementation here

    def stop(self):
        if self._task and not self._task.done():
            self._task.cancel()
```

Your task is to complete the `start` method so that it creates an asynchronous task that waits for `timeout` seconds and then calls the provided `callback` function. If the timer is stopped before expiration, the operation should be canceled.

What should the implementation of the `start` method look like?

A) 
```python
async def start(self, callback):
    self._task = asyncio.create_task(callback())
```

B)
```python
async def start(self, callback):
    self._task = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.sleep(self.timeout))
    await self._task
    if not self._task.done():
        callback()
```

C)
```python
async def start(self, callback):
    async def wrapper():
        await asyncio.sleep(self.timeout)
        if not self._task.cancelled():
            callback()
    self._task = asyncio.create_task(wrapper())
```

D)
```python
async def start(self, callback):
    self._task = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.sleep(self.timeout))
    try:
        await self._task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
    else:
        if not self._task.cancelled():
            callback()
```";"[ANSWER]
D) 
```python
async def start(self, callback):
    self._task = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.sleep(self.timeout))
    try:

    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
    else:
        if not self._task.cancelled():
            callback()
```

**Explanation:** The correct implementation of the `start` method uses an asynchronous task that waits for the specified timeout and then checks if the task was cancelled. If it wasn't cancelled, it calls the provided callback function. This ensures that the callback is only called when the timer expires and not if it's stopped prematurely."

Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes decorators, metaclasses, and async/await. The goal is to create a class `AsyncSingleton` that ensures only one instance of any subclass can be created asynchronously.

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    async def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = await super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

    instance1 = await AsyncSingleton(42)
    instance2 = await AsyncSingleton(99)
    
    print(instance1.value == instance2.value)  # Should be True
    print(id(instance1) == id(instance2))      # Should also be True

# asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the behavior of this code?

A) The class `AsyncSingleton` will always create a new instance when called, regardless of whether it already exists.

B) Both `instance1` and `instance2` are asynchronous instances of `AsyncSingleton`.

C) Due to the use of metaclasses and decorators, both `instance1` and `instance2` point to the same object, ensuring only one instance is created.

D) The code will raise an error due to incorrect usage of async/await with a singleton pattern.

Part 2 (Answer):
C) Due to the use of metaclasses and decorators, both `instance1` and `instance2` point to the same object, ensuring only one instance is created.

Explanation:
- The decorator `singleton` ensures that any subclass can be instantiated as a singleton. However, it does not handle async initialization properly.
- The metaclass `SingletonMeta` correctly handles asynchronous instantiation by checking if an instance already exists and returning it if so. It uses the `await super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)` to ensure proper asynchronous initialization of the subclass.
- In the usage example, both `instance1` and `instance2` are created asynchronously using `await`, but due to the singleton pattern enforced by both the decorator and the metaclass, they point to the same object in memory. Thus, `id(instance1) == id(instance2)` will be True.
- The condition `instance1.value == instance2.value` is also True because both instances have been initialized with the same value (42 in this case).

Option A is incorrect because of the metaclass's proper handling of asynchronous instantiation.
Option B is partially correct but not entirely accurate. The instances are async, but only one is created and reused.
Option D is incorrect because there is no error due to improper usage of async/await with a singleton pattern; it adheres correctly to both the decorator and metaclass implementations."

What happens when you create an instance of `MyClass` and call its `my_method`? Explain the role of decorators in this scenario.

A) The output will be: ""Something is happening before the function is called."" followed by ""This method is decorated.""

B) The output will be: ""This method is decorated."" followed by ""Something is happening before the function is called.""

D) The code creates a new class with the same name and methods but does not execute any print statements.";"A) The output will be: ""Something is happening before the function is called."" followed by ""This method is decorated.""

Explanation:
The decorator `my_decorator` wraps the instance method `my_method`. When an instance of `MyClass` calls `my_method`, it goes through the decorator first. This means that ""Something is happening before the function is called."" is printed, and then the original method's implementation runs, printing ""This method is decorated.""

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior of this code when run in a Python environment?

A) The decorator `log_calls` will log all method calls made to instances of `MyClass`, and the context manager will ensure that no instances are left behind.

B) The decorator `log_calls` will not affect the methods defined in `MyClass`, as metaclasses handle method wrapping differently.

C) The context manager `context_manager` is used correctly to create an instance of `MyClass`.

D) Instances created by `MyClass` will not have their method calls logged due to a misconfiguration in the decorator.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) The decorator `log_calls` will log all method calls made to instances of `MyClass`, and the context manager will ensure that no instances are left behind.

Explanation: The `log_calls` decorator wraps each callable attribute of an instance, printing its name and arguments when called. Since it's applied via a metaclass, it effectively decorates all methods defined in any class created with this metaclass.

A) Something is happening before the function is called. This is the original method. Something is happening after the function is called.

**Explanation:**

In this code, `MyMeta` is a metaclass that modifies any class it's applied to by wrapping its `my_method` with a decorator (`my_decorator`). The decorator adds print statements before and after calling the method.

When an instance of `MyClass` is created and `my_method` is called on that instance, the output should be:

1. ""Something is happening before the function is called.""

You are tasked with optimizing a Python application that frequently creates and discards small objects. The current approach involves creating new instances of a simple class `MyObject` each time an object is needed. You notice that the creation and destruction of these objects are causing significant overhead.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
class MyObject:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

def create_objects(data_list):
    return [MyObject(item) for item in data_list]
```

The `create_objects` function creates a new instance of `MyObject` for each item in the provided list. To optimize this, you decide to use a memory pool pattern instead of creating new objects every time.

Which of the following modifications to the code would effectively implement a memory pool for `MyObject` instances?

A) Implement a metaclass that manages a pool of `MyObject` instances:

```python
class ObjectPoolMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyObject(metaclass=ObjectPoolMeta):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
```

B) Implement a descriptor to manage the pool:

```python
class ObjectPool:
    _pool = []
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_instance(data):
        if not ObjectPool._pool:
            return MyObject(data)
        else:
            return ObjectPool._pool.pop(0)

class MyObject:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

def create_objects(data_list):
    return [MyObject.get_instance(item) for item in data_list]
```

C) Implement a decorator to manage the pool:

```python
def object_pool(func):
    _pool = []
    
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if not _pool:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            return _pool.pop(0)
    
    return wrapper

@object_pool
class MyObject:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
```

D) Implement a context manager to manage the pool:

```python
class ObjectPool:
    _pool = []
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_instance(data):
        if not ObjectPool._pool:
            return MyObject(data)
        else:
            return ObjectPool._pool.pop(0)

    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        pass

def create_objects(data_list):
    with ObjectPool() as pool:
        return [MyObject.get_instance(item) for item in data_list]
```";"[ANSWER] B

[EXPLANATION] The correct answer is B. Implementing a descriptor to manage the pool effectively allows you to reuse `MyObject` instances, thus reducing the overhead associated with their creation and destruction. The descriptor approach provides a way to control attribute access for class instances, making it suitable for managing resources like memory pools.

Option A uses a metaclass, which is less suitable here because metaclasses are used for creating classes rather than managing objects after their creation. Option C attempts to use a decorator, but decorators modify function calls and cannot manage object instantiation directly. Option D uses a context manager, which is not applicable in this scenario as it does not allow reusing the same instance across multiple function calls."

A) When `MyClass` is instantiated, it will automatically create a new method named `some_method` for each instance.

B) The metaclass `Meta` dynamically adds methods to `MyClass` based on its attributes during class creation. These methods print the name of the method being executed when called.

C) All instances of `MyClass` will share the same `some_method`.

D) When `obj.some_method()` is called, it will raise an AttributeError because `some_method` does not exist in `MyClass`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The metaclass `Meta` dynamically adds methods to `MyClass` based on its attributes during class creation. These methods print the name of the method being executed when called.

Explanation:  
The `Meta` metaclass defines a `__new__` method that iterates through all attributes of `cls` (which in this case is `MyClass`). For each non-special attribute, it creates a new method using the `create_method` static method. This method simply prints the name of the method when called. Therefore, any instance of `MyClass` will have access to these dynamically created methods, and calling them will print the respective method names as expected."

What is the purpose of using a metaclass in this scenario, and how does it affect the methods defined in `MyCoroutineClass`?

A) The metaclass ensures that all callable attributes within `MyCoroutineClass` are converted to coroutines.  
B) The metaclass adds threading capabilities to `MyCoroutineClass`.  
C) The metaclass implements garbage collection for instances of `MyCoroutineClass`.  
D) The metaclass provides a custom constructor for `MyCoroutineClass`.";"Part 2 (Answer):  
A) The metaclass ensures that all callable attributes within `MyCoroutineClass` are converted to coroutines.

Explanation: 
The metaclass `Meta` dynamically modifies any callable attribute (methods, functions) in the class it decorates. By wrapping these methods with the `coroutine_decorator`, it turns them into async functions using the `@wraps(func)` decorator to preserve their original properties. When an instance of `MyCoroutineClass` is created and its methods are called, they will execute asynchronously due to being wrapped by the coroutine decorator. This is crucial for maintaining asynchronous behavior throughout the class without explicitly decorating each method in the subclass."

Consider the following Python code that aims to implement a simple logging system with context management. However, it contains an error that prevents it from working as intended.

```python
class Log:
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message

    async def __aenter__(self):
        print(f""Entering log: {self.message}"")
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        if exc_type is None:
            print(f""Exiting log without error: {self.message}"")
        else:

    async with Log(""Test""):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        raise ValueError(""Test error"")

import asyncio
asyncio.run(test_log())
```

What is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed to correctly handle asynchronous operations within a context manager?

A) The `__aenter__` method should not be declared as `async`.
B) The `__aexit__` method should not raise an exception if one occurred.
C) The `test_log` function is not properly awaited.
D) The use of `async with` is incorrect and should be replaced with a regular `with`.";"[ANSWER]
A) The `__aenter__` method should not be declared as `async`.

**Explanation**: The issue lies in the declaration of the `__aenter__` method. Although it is intended to perform an asynchronous operation (printing), it should be implemented without the `async` keyword because it does not return a coroutine object. Instead, it returns `None`, which is the default behavior and correct for context managers that do not need to return anything.

To fix this issue, simply remove the `async` keyword from the `__aenter__` method:

```python
class Log:
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message

    def __aenter__(self):
        print(f""Entering log: {self.message}"")
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        if exc_type is None:
            print(f""Exiting log without error: {self.message}"")
        else:
            print(f""Exiting log with error: {exc_value}"")

async def test_log():
    async with Log(""Test""):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        raise ValueError(""Test error"")

import asyncio
asyncio.run(test_log())
```

Now, the context manager will work as intended, printing ""Entering log: Test"", waiting for 1 second, and then printing ""Exiting log with error: Test error""."

C) This is an additional attribute  
   Original Method  

D) Error in metaclass definition";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Answer: B) This is an additional attribute  
Method modified  
Original Method**

**Explanation:**  
- The `AddAttributeMeta` metaclass adds an attribute named `additional_attribute` to any class it decorates. When we create an instance of `MyClass`, this attribute is accessible, and its value is printed as ""This is an additional attribute"".
- The `modify_method` decorator modifies the behavior of any method it decorates by printing a message before executing the original method. Therefore, when `my_instance.my_method()` is called, it first prints ""Method modified"" and then proceeds to execute the original method, which prints ""Original Method""."

@timer
def my_function():

my_function()

What is the issue with this implementation of the `timer` decorator, and how can it be fixed to correctly measure and print the execution time?

A) The `wrapper` function is not defined properly.
B) The `timer` decorator is not using a closure correctly.
C) The `start_time` is captured before calling `func`, leading to an incorrect measurement.
D) The `end_time` should be captured before calling `print`.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) This option is incorrect because the `wrapper` function is defined within the `timer` decorator and captures `start_time` correctly.

C) This is the correct answer. The issue lies in the order of operations. `start_time` should be recorded after calling `func`, so that the execution time can be accurately measured from when the function starts to when it ends.

D) While capturing `end_time` before printing would not prevent the code from working, it's a matter of convention and does not fix the issue with the measurement itself.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

   Task started
   Task completed

C) The code will raise an error because metaclasses cannot be used with async methods directly.

D) None of the above

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Task started
   Task completed

Explanation:

In this question, we have a combination of decorators, metaclasses, and async/await. Let's break down how each component is used:

1. **Async Decorator**: The `async_decorator` function is defined to wrap any callable with asyncio.run, which allows calling asynchronous functions directly from synchronous contexts.

2. **Metaclass (AsyncMeta)**: The metaclass `AsyncMeta` dynamically adds the `async_decorator` to all methods defined in classes that use this metaclass. This means that when an instance method like `task` is called on an object created from a class with this metaclass, it will be automatically decorated by `async_decorator`, turning synchronous calls into asynchronous ones.

3. **Async Class (AsyncClass)**: The `AsyncClass` uses the `AsyncMeta` metaclass. This means that any callable method in `AsyncClass` will be automatically wrapped by the async decorator during class creation. As a result, when `obj.task()` is called, it will run asynchronously.

4. **Main Function**: The `main` function creates an instance of `AsyncClass` and calls its `task` method. Due to the metaclass magic, the `task` method is treated as async within the context of this call, even though it's not directly defined as such in the class definition.

When you run this code, it will print ""Task started"" followed by ""Task completed"". The asynchronous nature ensures that ""Task completed"" is printed after a 1-second delay."

A) meta_attribute: set by metaclass, decorated_attribute: set by decorator  
B) AttributeError for both  
C) meta_attribute: None, decorated_attribute: set by decorator  
D) None, None";"Part 2 (Answer):
A) meta_attribute: set by metaclass, decorated_attribute: set by decorator

Explanation:
- The `Meta` metaclass is invoked during the creation of `MyClass`. It adds an attribute `meta_attribute` to the class with the value 'set by metaclass'.
- The `my_decorator` function is applied to `MyClass` after its creation. This function adds another attribute `decorated_attribute` to `MyClass` with the value 'set by decorator'.

Thus, both attributes are successfully added to `MyClass`, and accessing them through `print(MyClass.meta_attribute)` and `print(MyClass.decorated_attribute)` will output their respective values."

D) It runs asynchronously and completes in 1 second.";"Part 2 (Answer):
C) It executes synchronously and blocks while waiting for the sleep to complete.

Explanation:
When `fetch_data` is decorated with `@async_decorator`, it is wrapped by a function that schedules its execution using `asyncio.run(func(*args, **kwargs))`. This means that calling `fetch_data()` directly will not return a coroutine but will instead block until the asynchronous operation completes.

Implement a Python decorator that measures the execution time of a function. However, this decorator should only execute if the function has been called at least `n` times before it starts timing its execution. If the function is called less than `n` times, it should return immediately without executing the function.

Write the decorator and demonstrate its usage with an example function that calculates the factorial of a number.

```python
def time_if_called_n_times(n):
    # Your implementation here

@time_if_called_n_times(3)
def factorial(num):
    if num == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return num * factorial(num - 1)

# Example usage and testing
print(factorial(5))  # Should call the function and print the result
print(factorial(4))  # Should call the function and print the result
print(factorial(3))  # Should not start timing, just return immediately
```

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A B D

The correct answer is A.

Explanation:
- **Option A:** Correct. The decorator `time_if_called_n_times` checks if a function has been called at least `n` times before it starts measuring its execution time. It uses a closure to keep track of the number of calls and only applies the timing functionality if the condition is met.
  
- **Option B:** Incorrect. This option would imply that the decorator should work for any function, which contradicts the requirement of not starting timing until the function has been called at least `n` times.

- **Option D:** Incorrect. This option suggests that the decorator should always call the function and measure its execution time, regardless of how many times it has been called. This is incorrect because it does not meet the requirement of not starting timing before `n` calls have been made.

You are tasked with creating a context manager that measures the execution time of any code block it decorates. The context manager should return the elapsed time in seconds as a float. However, you need to ensure that the context manager handles exceptions gracefully and does not raise an error if the code block raises one.

Write a Python class `Timer` that meets the above requirements. Your implementation should use the `time` module for timing.

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):

# Example usage:
with Timer() as t:
    result = [i * i for i in range(10000)]
print(f""Elapsed time: {t} seconds"")
```";"Part 2 (Answer):
A) `__enter__` should record the start time, and `__exit__` should calculate and return the elapsed time. The exception handling can be done by simply returning `False` in the `__exit__` method to suppress exceptions.

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()

A) This is correct.

The output correctly shows that both variables `obj1` and `obj2` are indeed the same instance (`True`), and it properly manages the resource in the `with` statement.

B) This is incorrect because the `debug_decorator` is applied to `SingletonClass`'s constructor, which isn't called due to the singleton pattern. The `managed_resource` context manager is called correctly within the `main` function.

C) This is partially correct as it shows that both `obj1` and `obj2` are the same instance (`True`). However, the output of the resource management part is missing a step where the resource is returned or used. The output should end with ""Releasing resource"".

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses both a decorator and a metaclass to control class behavior. The goal is to ensure that any instance of the class `Example` can only be instantiated if it has an attribute `value` set to a positive integer. Otherwise, instantiation should raise an error.

```python
def positive_value_decorator(cls):
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(cls, 'value') or cls.value <= 0:
            raise ValueError(""Instance must have a positive value attribute"")
        return super().__new__(cls)
    cls.__new__ = __new__
    return cls

class Meta(type):
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(cls, 'value') or cls.value <= 0:
            raise ValueError(""Class must have a positive value attribute"")
        return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

@positive_value_decorator
class Example(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Usage
try:
    obj = Example(-1)  # This should raise an error
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

Which of the following modifications is necessary to ensure that the `Example` class can only be instantiated with a positive integer value?

A. Remove the `positive_value_decorator` decorator and modify the metaclass to check for the attribute in the class instead of instances.

B. Modify both the decorator and the metaclass to check if any subclass has the `value` attribute set before allowing instantiation.

C. Change the metaclass to use a different method (`__init_subclass__`) instead of `__call__`.

D. Add a default value to the constructor that ensures `value` is always positive.";"[B] Modify both the decorator and the metaclass to check if any subclass has the `value` attribute set before allowing instantiation.

Explanation: Both the decorator and the metaclass are currently checking whether an instance or class has a `value` attribute and ensuring it's positive. However, this approach only enforces the condition at the time of instantiation. To ensure that any subclass also adheres to this rule, we need to modify both the decorator and the metaclass to check for the presence of the `value` attribute in subclasses during their creation. This is achieved by overriding the `__init_subclass__` method in the metaclass or ensuring that both mechanisms check if the subclass has the attribute before allowing it to be instantiated."

What will be printed to the console when you run this code? Choose the correct option that accurately describes the behavior of the `Singleton` class and its usage within the threads.

A) Both threads will print ""42"".

B) One thread will print ""42"" and the other might print a different value or raise an error.

C) An error will be raised because Singleton is not designed to be used with multiple threads simultaneously.

D) The code will deadlock due to improper synchronization of thread access.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) One thread will print ""42"" and the other might print a different value or raise an error.

Explanation: In the provided code, the `Singleton` class is designed using a metaclass that ensures only one instance of the class exists across all threads. However, within each thread, a `ThreadLocalSingleton` object is created and used as a context manager to manage some state. The use of a `ThreadLocalSingleton` means that the state (`_value`) is local to the thread, not shared among threads. Therefore, when multiple threads run concurrently and access the same `Singleton` instance, each will create its own `ThreadLocalSingleton`, and the values set in one thread might not be visible or consistent across other threads. This can lead to different outputs or even errors if the code relies on state consistency between threads.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

What will be the output of this code when executed?

A) [0, 0]  
B) [1, 1]  
C) [0, 1]  
D) [1, 2]";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B) [1, 1].

Explanation:

- The `AsyncCounter` class has an `increment` method that increments a counter after simulating some asynchronous work with `asyncio.sleep(1)`.
- In the `main` function, two tasks (`task1` and `task2`) are created to run the `increment` method concurrently.
- Since both tasks start almost immediately and their sleep times overlap only briefly (due to the short duration of `await asyncio.sleep(1)`), both tasks will successfully complete before the main coroutine finishes.
- The final count after both tasks have completed is 2, but each task individually returns its own value of the counter. Therefore, the output `[1, 1]` reflects that each task returned the same count (the last value set by `self.count`) before it was incremented again."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

    tasks = [fetch_data(i) for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

The `fetch_data` function simulates a network request that takes 1 second to complete. The `main` function creates a list of tasks that fetch data concurrently using `asyncio.gather`. If an exception occurs during the execution of any task, it should be caught and handled gracefully.

Which of the following statements about the provided code is true?

A) All tasks will complete in 1 second because they are executed concurrently.  
B) The `return_exceptions=True` parameter allows for exceptions to propagate if not caught.  
C) If an exception occurs, it will stop all other tasks from executing.  
D) Each task runs on a separate thread, thus improving performance.

**Part 2: Answer**

A) Correct. All tasks will complete in 1 second because they are executed concurrently using `asyncio.gather`. The `await asyncio.sleep(1)` line suspends the execution of each task for 1 second without blocking other tasks.

B) Incorrect. The `return_exceptions=True` parameter allows exceptions to be caught and returned as part of the results list, not propagate if not caught.

C) Incorrect. If an exception occurs in a task, it will only stop that specific task from completing; other tasks will continue to execute.

D) Incorrect. The provided code does not create separate threads for each task. It uses asyncio's event loop to manage asynchronous execution, which is single-threaded but can handle multiple tasks concurrently."

A) Creates a new class with no attributes  
B) Prints ""This is new"" twice  
C) Adds a new attribute to `MyClass` and prints its value along with the existing attribute  
D) Raises an error

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct Answer:** C) Adds a new attribute to `MyClass` and prints its value along with the existing attribute

**Explanation:**

In this code, we define a metaclass `Meta` that inherits from `type`. The `__new__` method of this metaclass is overridden to dynamically add a new attribute `new_attr` with the value 'This is new' to any class that uses it as its metaclass. When we create an instance of `MyClass`, which uses `Meta` as its metaclass, the `__new__` method in `Meta` modifies the class by adding `new_attr`. Therefore, when we print the attributes of `instance`, we see both the existing attribute `existing_attr` and the new attribute `new_attr` being printed."

What is the output of calling `Calculator().add(3, 4)` and `Calculator().multiply(5, 6)`?

A) `Calling add with args: (3, 4), kwargs: {}; add returned: 7`  
B) `Calling multiply with args: (5, 6), kwargs: {}; multiply returned: 30`

D) `Calling multiply with args: (5,), kwargs: {'b': 6}; multiply returned: 30`";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) `Calling add with args: (3, 4), kwargs: {}; add returned: 7`

This is the correct answer. The `log_method_calls` decorator dynamically wraps all callable methods in the `Calculator` class with a logging wrapper. When `add(3, 4)` is called, it prints the method call and return value as specified.

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator for async functions which measures their execution time:

A) ""async_task took 0.0000 seconds to execute""  
B) ""async_task took 2.0000 seconds to execute""  
C) The program raises an exception because decorators do not support async functions  
D) The execution time cannot be measured accurately for async functions";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) ""async_task took 2.0000 seconds to execute""

Explanation: The `measure_time` decorator is correctly implemented for async functions using the `@wraps(func)` decorator from the `functools` module, which preserves the metadata of the original function. When applied to an async function like `async_task`, it measures the execution time accurately by capturing the start and end times within the async context provided by `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`. Therefore, when `asyncio.run(async_task())` is called, it should print ""async_task took 2.0000 seconds to execute"", as the function `async_task` suspends for 2 seconds using `await asyncio.sleep(2)`."

Consider the following code snippet that uses a decorator to cache results of a function based on its arguments. This caching mechanism is crucial for performance improvement when dealing with expensive or frequently called functions. Your task is to identify what issue might arise if this caching mechanism is used in a multi-threaded environment and suggest a solution.

**Part 2 (Answer):**  
A: The cache is not thread-safe. [Explanation: In the given code, if two threads call `compute_expensive_result` with the same arguments simultaneously, both might miss the cache and start recomputing the value concurrently. This can lead to unnecessary computations and potential race conditions.]

B: The function does not handle exceptions. [Explanation: This option is irrelevant as there are no exceptions being handled in the provided code snippet.]

C: The memoize decorator should be implemented using a lock to ensure thread safety. [Explanation: A correct solution would involve modifying the `memoize` function to include a lock that ensures only one thread can compute and cache the result at a time for the same arguments, preventing race conditions.]

D: The threading module is not being used correctly. [Explanation: This option is incorrect as there are no issues with how threads are created or started in the provided code snippet.]"

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The `additional_method` is added to all subclasses of `Base` that use `AddMethodMeta`.

Explanation: The metaclass `AddMethodMeta` dynamically adds an `additional_method` to any class it decorates.

"2025-08-10 16:02";"[QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a Python library that needs to ensure the correct initialization of resources before their use and proper cleanup afterward, regardless of how many times the resource is used or when the program exits. You decide to implement this functionality using context managers.

Write a context manager class named `ResourceGuard` that ensures a resource (simulated by opening a file) is properly opened at the beginning and closed after all operations within its block are completed. The class should handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring that the resource is always cleaned up if an error occurs during the use of the resource.

Your implementation should include:
1. An `__enter__` method that opens the file and returns a file object.
2. An `__exit__` method that handles exceptions and ensures the file is closed properly.

Here's a starting point for your implementation:

```python
class ResourceGuard:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename

    def __enter__(self):
        # Open the file here and return the file object
        pass

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        # Handle exceptions and close the file here
        pass
```

Implement the `ResourceGuard` class according to the requirements.";"[ANSWER] A

The correct implementation of the `ResourceGuard` context manager is as follows:

```python
class ResourceGuard:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename

    def __enter__(self):
        # Open the file here and return the file object
        self.file = open(self.filename, 'w')
        return self.file

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        # Handle exceptions and close the file here
        if exc_type is not None:
            print(f""An error occurred: {exc_val}"")
        self.file.close()
```

Explanation:

- The `__enter__` method opens the file in write mode (`'w'`) and returns the file object. This ensures that the file is opened when entering the context.
  
- The `__exit__` method takes three arguments: `exc_type`, `exc_val`, and `exc_tb`. These represent the exception type, value, and traceback if an exception occurred within the context block. If an exception did occur, it prints the error message. Regardless of whether an exception occurred, it always closes the file to ensure proper cleanup.

This implementation ensures that the resource is always cleaned up properly, even if an error occurs during its use. The `ResourceGuard` class can be used as follows:

```python
with ResourceGuard('example.txt') as f:
    f.write('Hello, world!')
```

This will correctly handle file opening and closing, ensuring that the file is closed after writing to it, even if an error occurs during the write operation."

A) The `@log_calls` decorator should be applied directly on the `my_method` inside the class.

B) Each instance of `MyClass` needs its own `_count` attribute, and the metaclass should not track calls across instances.

C) Modify `Tracker._count` to increment each time any method in any subclass is called, not just `my_method`.

D) The current implementation already tracks how many times `my_method` has been called on all instances of `MyClass`. No changes are necessary.";"Part 2 (Answer): A) The `@log_calls` decorator should be applied directly on the `my_method` inside the class.

Explanation: The given code uses a metaclass to track the number of times each method is called across all instances. However, it does not ensure that every time `my_method` is called, it logs how many times it has been called in total across all instances. To achieve this, the decorator should be applied directly on the `my_method`. This ensures that every time `my_method` is called, it increments its count and prints the total number of calls made to it across all instances. The metaclass correctly tracks the number of times each method is called but does not log or display this information in a way that meets the requirement specified in the question."

D) Neither the `sleep` nor the `add` methods are decorated with the `timer` decorator.";"[ANSWER] C) Both the `sleep` and `add` methods are decorated with the `timer` decorator.

Explanation: The `TimerMeta` metaclass dynamically wraps all callable attributes (methods) of any class defined with this metaclass in a `timer` decorator, which measures and prints the execution time of these methods. Since both `sleep` and `add` are callable and not special methods (those starting or ending with double underscores), they will be decorated by the `TimerMeta`."
"2025-08-12 00:02";"[QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code using decorators:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(""Something is happening before the function is called."")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(""Something is happening after the function is called."")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello(name):
    print(f""Hello {name}!"")

say_hello(""Alice"")
```

This code defines a decorator `my_decorator` that logs messages before and after the execution of the decorated function. When calling `say_hello(""Alice"")`, it prints:

```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello Alice!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

Now, let's consider a scenario where we want to modify this decorator so that it can accept arguments and use them in its wrapper. 

**Question:**
How can you modify `my_decorator` to accept parameters? Modify the code accordingly and provide an example of how to call the decorated function with these new capabilities.

A) 
```python
@my_decorator('extra')
def say_hello(name):
    print(f""Hello {name}!"")
```

B)
```python
def my_decorator(message):
    def wrapper(func, *args, **kwargs):
        print(""Something is happening before the function is called."")
        print(message)
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(""Something is happening after the function is called."")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator('extra')
def say_hello(name):
    print(f""Hello {name}!"")

say_hello(""Alice"")
```

C)
```python
def my_decorator(message):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(""Something is happening before the function is called."")
            print(message)
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print(""Something is happening after the function is called."")
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@my_decorator('extra')
def say_hello(name):
    print(f""Hello {name}!"")

say_hello(""Alice"")
```

D)
```python

    return wrapper

@my_decorator('extra')
def say_hello(name):
    print(f""Hello {name}!"")

say_hello(""Alice"")
```";"C) 

**Explanation:**
The correct answer is C. This option correctly modifies `my_decorator` to accept a parameter and uses it within the wrapper function. Here's how it works:

```python
def my_decorator(message):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(""Something is happening before the function is called."")
            print(message)
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print(""Something is happening after the function is called."")
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@my_decorator('extra')
def say_hello(name):
    print(f""Hello {name}!"")

say_hello(""Alice"")
```

When calling `say_hello(""Alice"")`, it now prints:

```
Something is happening before the function is called.
extra
Hello Alice!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

This demonstrates how to create a decorator that can accept parameters and use them within its wrapper function."
"2025-08-12 08:03";"[QUESTION]  
You are tasked with creating a decorator that can be used to measure the execution time of any function it decorates. The decorator should also handle asynchronous functions correctly. Here is an initial implementation:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
async def async_task():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an asynchronous task
    return ""Task completed""
```

The code above works for synchronous functions but fails when used with asynchronous functions. Modify the `timing_decorator` so that it can correctly measure and print the execution time of both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

A) 
```python
import asyncio

def timing_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)

            return result
    return wrapper
```

**Explanation**: The correct answer is B. The original decorator does not handle asynchronous functions correctly because it assumes that all decorated functions are synchronous. By using `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction` to check if the function is a coroutine, we can differentiate between synchronous and asynchronous functions. For synchronous functions, we proceed as before by measuring and printing the execution time. For asynchronous functions, we use `asyncio.run` to run the coroutine and then measure the execution time before printing it. This approach ensures that the decorator works correctly for both types of functions.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a decorator for an asynchronous function to measure its execution time. However, there is a critical issue in this implementation:

```python
import asyncio

def async_timer(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)

```

Identify the issue with the `async_timer` decorator and propose a fix.

A) The decorator is not correctly handling asynchronous operations.
B) The decorator does not properly measure the execution time of an async function.
C) The decorator will cause an infinite loop when used on an async function.
D) There is no issue; the decorator works as intended.";"[B] The decorator does not properly measure the execution time of an async function.

Explanation: The `async_timer` decorator correctly uses `await` to ensure that it waits for the asynchronous operation inside the decorated function to complete. However, it incorrectly measures the execution time by calling `time.time()` from outside the event loop context. This will give the total time since the last call to `time.time()`, rather than the actual execution time of the coroutine. To fix this, the decorator should use `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` inside the `wrapper` function to accurately measure the duration of the coroutine's execution.

Corrected code:

```python
import asyncio

def async_timer(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)

        print(f""{func.__name__} took {end - start} seconds to execute"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@async_timer

    await asyncio.sleep(1)

# Usage
import time
start_time = time.time()
result = asyncio.run(my_async_function(5))
print(f""Result: {result}"")

**A) is incorrect.** The `wrapper` function inside the class does not have access to `*args` and `**kwargs`, which are passed to the original function.

**B) is correct.** This implementation correctly captures the function reference in its constructor and uses it during execution, maintaining all necessary parameters.

**C) is incorrect.** There is a missing definition for `*args` and `**kwargs` within the `__call__` method, causing an error when calling the decorated function.

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    async def increment(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    counter = AsyncCounter()
    
    tasks = [counter.increment() for _ in range(5)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when you run this code?

A) The count is incremented by 1 every second, and after 5 seconds, the final value of `count` will be 5.

B) The count is incremented by 1 immediately for all tasks, making `count` equal to 5 at the end.

C) The count is never incremented because each call to `increment` is made before the previous one has completed.

D) An error occurs because `asyncio.sleep` cannot be used in a non-async function.

### Part 2 (Answer)

**A)**

The code correctly demonstrates asynchronous execution using asyncio. Each call to `counter.increment()` is awaited, meaning it will pause for 1 second before incrementing the count. After 5 seconds, the final value of `count` will be 5 because each task has its own sleep interval.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

You are tasked with creating a custom context manager that not only manages the opening and closing of files but also adds a timestamp to the beginning of each file when it is opened. The goal is to ensure that every time a file is accessed through this context manager, it automatically prepends a line with the current date and time.

Given the following code skeleton:

```python
import datetime

class TimestampedFile:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode
        self.file = None

    def __enter__(self):
        # Open the file in append mode if it does not exist, otherwise create a new one.
        pass

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        # Close the file and handle any exceptions if necessary.
        pass

# Usage example:
with TimestampedFile('log.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write(""This is a test log entry."")
```

Complete the implementation of `TimestampedFile` such that it correctly opens the file, prepends a timestamp to each write operation, and ensures proper cleanup.

**Options:**
A) The context manager should append the timestamp to every line written, ensuring consistency across all writes.
B) The context manager should prepend a timestamp at the start of the file and handle file opening/closing within `__enter__` and `__exit__`.
C) The context manager should only log errors and not modify the file's contents.
D) None of the above.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The context manager should prepend a timestamp at the start of the file and handle file opening/closing within `__enter__` and `__exit__`.

Explanation: A correct implementation of this context manager would open the file in append mode (`'a'`) if it does not exist or create a new one. Inside the `__enter__` method, it should check if the file is already at the end of the file to determine whether to write the timestamp. The timestamp should be written before any other content added to the file during the context manager's block. In the `__exit__` method, it should close the file properly. This ensures that every time a file is accessed through this context manager, it automatically prepends a line with the current date and time."

D) The Lock class in threading is not necessary for this scenario.";"C) The use of a Lock ensures that the counter is incremented correctly without race conditions.

Explanation: In the provided code, the `SafeCounter` class uses a lock to ensure that only one thread can execute the `increment` method at a time. This prevents multiple threads from reading and writing to the shared `value` variable simultaneously, which could lead to race conditions where the final value is less than expected. Therefore, option C correctly identifies that the Lock ensures correct incrementing of the counter, while options A and B are incorrect because they suggest an outcome that does not account for potential race conditions caused by concurrent access to the shared resource. Option D is incorrect because it states that a Lock is unnecessary, which contradicts the intended use of the `SafeCounter` class in this context."

Part 2 (Answer):
A) The `call_counter` decorator will correctly count how many times `my_function` has been called.

Explanation: The `@wraps(func)` decorator from `functools` is used to preserve the metadata of the original function (`my_function`). This means that accessing `my_function.__name__`, `my_function.__doc__`, etc., will return the same values as before the decoration.

Explanation: When you run this code, the `add_method` decorator is used to add a new method named `display_value` to the `MyClass` class at runtime. The `wrapper` function inside the decorator prints ""Method added at runtime"" and then calls the original function (which in this case is `print`).

Which of the following modifications to the `add_created_at` decorator would ensure that the `created_at` attribute is set correctly and efficiently, even if multiple instances of the decorated class are created in different threads?

A) Ensure that the timestamp is calculated when an instance is initialized.

B) Use a thread-safe method to calculate the timestamp, such as `time.thread_time()` instead of `time.time()`.

C) Introduce a global variable to store timestamps for each instance.

D) Implement memoization within the decorator to avoid redundant calculations of timestamps.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
A) Ensure that the timestamp is calculated when an instance is initialized.

The correct answer is A. The `created_at` attribute should be set when the instance is created, not at any other time. Option B introduces unnecessary complexity and does not address the issue.

You are working on a project where you need to implement a system that can dynamically create classes based on certain conditions. You decide to use metaclasses for this purpose. Below is a simplified version of what you have implemented:

```python
class DynamicClass(type):

This code works as expected when `create_method` is defined in the subclass. However, you want to ensure that if a subclass does not define `create_method`, it raises an error. Modify the metaclass `DynamicClass` so that it checks for the presence of `create_method` and raises a TypeError if it is missing.

[B] Use `__init_subclass__` to perform the check.
[C] Both A and B
[D] None of the above";"[ANSWER]
A

Explanation:
The correct answer is [A]. The `__new__` method in a metaclass is called when a new class is created. By implementing the check for `create_method` inside this method, you ensure that if a subclass does not define it, a TypeError will be raised before the class can be instantiated. Using `__init_subclass__`, while useful for some initialization tasks during subclass creation, does not allow raising an error in case of missing methods because it is called after the class has been fully created and no longer raises errors if methods are missing."

C) The `_log_method` static method incorrectly applies the decorator, leading to a recursion error.

D) There's no issue with the code and it will work as expected without any changes.";"Part 2 (Answer):

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The provided code is almost correct but has a subtle issue. The `LogMeta` metaclass correctly replaces each callable method in the class dictionary with a wrapped version that logs the arguments and then calls the original method. However, there's no explicit call to `super().__new__()` at the end of the `__new__` method inside `LogMeta`. This can lead to unexpected behavior if other metaclasses are involved or if additional base classes have their own metaclass implementations.

To fix this issue and ensure that the metaclass behaves as expected, you should include a call to `super().__new__()` at the end of the `__new__` method within the `LogMeta` class. This will properly create the new class type with the updated dictionary, ensuring that all methods are correctly wrapped.

Once this is corrected, the code will log the method calls as expected and print the result when `my_instance.my_method(3, 4)` is called."

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a Singleton pattern. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of a class can be created, even when multiple instances are attempted.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):

    print(s2.value)  # This should also be 42
```

Which of the following statements about the provided code is true?

A) The `Singleton` class can have multiple instances depending on how it is instantiated.
B) The `_instances` dictionary in the metaclass is used to store all instances created by subclasses of `Singleton`.
C) When a subclass of `Singleton` is instantiated, its constructor is called even if an instance already exists.
D) The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that no matter how many times `Singleton()` is called, only one instance is returned.";"[ANSWER]
D

The `SingletonMeta` metaclass uses a dictionary `_instances` to store instances of the class. When `__call__` is invoked (which happens whenever an instance of a class is created), it checks if an instance already exists in `_instances`. If not, it creates a new one and stores it. Subsequent calls return the stored instance. Therefore, regardless of how many times `Singleton()` is called, only one instance is returned, ensuring the Singleton pattern is adhered to."

A) The program will run indefinitely as `asyncio.sleep(1)` blocks the event loop.

B) The total count printed at the end will be 5, and the execution time will be approximately 5 seconds due to the sleep calls.

C) The total count printed will be less than 5 because some increments might not complete due to context switching.

D) The program will raise an exception because `counter.get_count()` cannot be awaited without an instance of `AsyncCounter`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B

The program will run for approximately 5 seconds, as the `await asyncio.sleep(1)` calls in the `increment` method cause the coroutine to yield control back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run.

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add a custom method to all classes it decorates. The goal is to create a new class attribute `total_instances` that keeps track of how many instances have been created for each class.

```python
class InstanceTrackerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['total_instances'] = 0

Which of the following statements correctly describes why `MyClass.total_instances` equals 2?

A) The metaclass is not working because it does not track instances correctly.

B) The metaclass is working as intended, and each time an instance of MyClass is created, the `total_instances` attribute is incremented.

C) The class decorator should be applied directly to the class definition rather than using a metaclass.

D) The use of a metaclass for this purpose is unnecessary; a simpler approach with a class variable would suffice.";"B) The metaclass is working as intended, and each time an instance of MyClass is created, the `total_instances` attribute is incremented.

Explanation: In the provided code, `InstanceTrackerMeta` is a metaclass that adds a `total_instances` class attribute to any class it decorates. When an instance of a decorated class is created, the `__call__` method of the metaclass increments this `total_instances` attribute. Since two instances (`obj1` and `obj2`) are created from `MyClass`, `MyClass.total_instances` correctly equals 2, demonstrating that the metaclass is functioning as intended to track instance counts."

D) Function Execution Time: Y.YY seconds followed by Result: 333335000

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]

**Part 2: Answer**

B) Result: 333335000  

Explanation:

- The `@Cached()` decorator is applied first, and it caches the result of `compute_heavy_task(10000)`. When `compute_heavy_task` is called with this argument, the cached value is immediately returned.
  
- The `@Timer()` decorator measures the execution time of a function. However, since `@Cached()` has already executed and stored the result, the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods of the `Timer` class are not called when `compute_heavy_task(10000)` is invoked for the second time.

C) The `__call__` method of `AsyncDecorator` ensures that the wrapped function returns an awaitable object.

Explanation: In this code, `AsyncDecorator` is used to convert any synchronous function into an asynchronous one. When you decorate a function with `@AsyncDecorator`, it wraps the original function in an instance of `AsyncDecorator`. The `__call__` method is overridden in this class to make sure that when the decorated function is called, it returns an awaitable object, allowing it to be awaited using `await`.

Option A is incorrect because `fetch_data()` is already defined as an asynchronous function. Option B is incorrect because calling `await fetch_data()` will pause execution of `main()` until `fetch_data()` completes.

- When an attempt is made to create an instance of `MyClass`, the metaclass checks if an instance already exists for that class in `_instances`.
- If an instance does not exist, it proceeds with normal class instantiation and stores the new instance in `_instances`.
- Any subsequent attempts to instantiate `MyClass` will return the existing instance from `_instances`, ensuring that only one instance of `MyClass` is created.

To implement this, we need to create a metaclass `AsyncMeta` that checks if the class it decorates is a subclass of `AsyncTask`. We also need an asynchronous decorator `@time_task` that measures and prints the execution time of each task.

1. **Define the Metaclass**:
   The metaclass will ensure that all classes decorated by `AsyncMeta` are subclasses of `AsyncTask`.

2. **Implement the Decorator**:
   The decorator will measure the execution time of the coroutine and print it.

Here's a complete implementation:

```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps

class AsyncMeta(type):

    task_type = 'AsyncTask'

def time_task(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        print(f""{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@AsyncTask
@time_task
async def task1():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print(""Task 1 done"")

When you run this code, it should output:
```
Task 1 done
Task 2 done
task1 took 2.00 seconds

C) Properly logging the acquisition and release of resources sequentially.
D) Implementing true asynchronous resource management with tasks running in separate coroutines.

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]
**Answer:**
**D)**

Explanation:
Option D correctly implements true asynchronous resource management. It uses `asyncio.gather` to run `_acquire` and `_release` methods concurrently for each resource, ensuring that the entire operation is asynchronous and efficient. This setup allows tasks within the `execute` method to run in separate coroutines, adhering to the requirement of executing them asynchronously. Additionally, it properly handles context management by acquiring resources before task execution and releasing them afterward.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to implement a simple caching mechanism using decorators. However, it fails to achieve its intended purpose. Your task is to identify the issue with the code and suggest a fix.

```python
import time

def cache_results(func):
    cache = {}
    
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]

# Usage
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should take about 1 second
print(expensive_function(5))  # This should be instant, as it uses the cache
```

Which of the following options correctly identifies the issue and provides a suitable fix?

A) The `cache` dictionary is not thread-safe. Use a threading lock to ensure thread safety.

B) The decorator does not handle keyword arguments properly. Modify the `wrapper` function to accept and pass through keyword arguments.

C) The cache should be cleared periodically to prevent memory leaks. Implement a mechanism to clear the cache after a certain period.

D) The `cache_results` decorator is incorrectly using a global scope for the cache dictionary. Encapsulate it in a closure or use a class-based approach.

**Part 2 (Answer):**  
B) The decorator does not handle keyword arguments properly. Modify the `wrapper` function to accept and pass through keyword arguments.

The issue with the provided code is that it only caches results based on positional arguments, ignoring any keyword arguments. When keyword arguments are used, a new cache entry would be created for each set of keyword arguments, leading to unnecessary computations.

To fix this, modify the `wrapper` function to accept and pass through both positional and keyword arguments using `*args` and `**kwargs`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import time

def cache_results(func):
    cache = {}

# Usage
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should take about 1 second

What will be the output of this code?

A) `True`, `10`
B) `True`, `20`
C) `False`, `10`
D) `False`, `20`

[ANSWER]
A) `True`, `10`

Explanation:
The Singleton metaclass is used to ensure that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created, no matter how many times it is instantiated. In the given code, when `obj1 = MyClass(10)` and `obj2 = MyClass(20)` are executed, the metaclass's `__call__` method checks if an instance already exists for the class `MyClass`. Since it does not, it creates a new instance with the value `10` and stores it in `_instances`. When `obj2 = MyClass(20)` is executed, the same instance (`obj1`) is returned from `_instances`, ensuring that both `obj1` and `obj2` refer to the same object. Therefore, `obj1 is obj2` evaluates to `True`, and both `obj1.value` and `obj2.value` are `10`.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

```

What is the primary issue with this code? How can it be improved to ensure that the cache behaves correctly even when `time` module functions are not available?

A) The `time.time()` function is used directly which will raise an error if the time module is not imported. Use `self.cache[url]['timestamp'] = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` instead.

B) The `fetch_data` method simulates data fetching, but it uses `asyncio.sleep`, which blocks the event loop. This can be improved by using a non-blocking sleep alternative.

C) The cache does not handle concurrent access correctly. Use threading locks to ensure that the cache is thread-safe.

D) None of the above issues are present in the code.";"A) The `time.time()` function is used directly which will raise an error if the time module is not imported. Use `self.cache[url]['timestamp'] = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` instead.

**Explanation:**
The primary issue with this code lies in the use of `time.time()`. Since the code assumes that the `time` module has been imported, it will raise an error if it hasn't, which could happen in some contexts where the time module might not be available. To fix this, we should use a method that is aware of the current event loop, such as `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()`. This ensures that the code works even in environments where the time module might not be directly accessible.

Option B and C are incorrect because:
- The `fetch_data` method uses `await asyncio.sleep(1)`, which is non-blocking and does not block the event loop.
- The cache implementation does not use threading locks, making it susceptible to concurrency issues if accessed by multiple tasks simultaneously."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to dynamically add methods to classes based on their attributes:

```python

What does the `DynamicMethodMeta` metaclass do? Additionally, what is the expected output when running the code snippet?

A) The metaclass dynamically adds a method named `log_x` to `MyClass`. When called, it logs ""Logging x"".

B) The metaclass dynamically adds a method named `log_y` to `MyClass`. When called, it logs ""Logging y"".

C) The metaclass dynamically adds methods for every attribute in the class. When called, they all log ""Logging <attribute_name>"".

D) None of the above.";"### Answer:
**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** 
The `DynamicMethodMeta` metaclass works by inspecting each attribute of a class during its creation (`__new__` method). If an attribute does not start with an underscore, it dynamically creates a new method in the form of `log_<attribute_name>`. This method logs ""Logging <attribute_name>"" when called. In this specific example, `MyClass` has two attributes, `x` and `y`. Therefore, the metaclass adds two methods: `log_x` and `log_y`. When `obj.log_x()` is called, it returns ""Logging x"", as expected."

B) The decorator modifies the original function signature.
C) It causes a memory leak when applied to large functions.
D) The output will always be 0 seconds.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A) It does not support asynchronous functions.
This is incorrect because the `timing_decorator` works with both synchronous and asynchronous functions. To make it work with async functions, you would need to modify the decorator to use `async def wrapper` and call `await func(*args, **kwargs)`.

B) The decorator modifies the original function signature.
This is correct. While not an issue for this specific example, decorators can potentially alter the docstring, name, or other attributes of the decorated function, leading to unexpected behavior when using tools that rely on these attributes.

C) It causes a memory leak when applied to large functions.
This is incorrect. The decorator itself does not cause memory leaks; it merely adds timing functionality without additional overhead.

D. When run, the `main` function will output ""Elapsed time: 2 seconds"".";"A. The `AsyncTimer` class implements a context manager that measures elapsed time.

Explanation:
- The `AsyncTimer` class is defined to be used as an asynchronous context manager with the `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods.
- In the `__aenter__`, it records the start time of the timer.
- In the `__aexit__`, it calculates the elapsed time by subtracting the start time from the current time and prints it. This is done asynchronously using `await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)`.
- The usage in `main` correctly demonstrates how to use an asynchronous context manager with `async with`. When run, it will indeed output ""Elapsed time: 2 seconds"" because the total execution time of the block inside `async with` (which includes the 2-second sleep call) is approximately 3 seconds, but the print statement is delayed by the interval specified in the `AsyncTimer` constructor."

**What is the impact of using the `log_calls` decorator on performance when calling methods of the `Calculator` class?**

A) The performance degradation is negligible as logging is fast.

B) The performance can significantly degrade due to increased overhead from method calls and prints.

C) Using decorators for logging does not affect performance at all.

D) It depends on the complexity of the decorated functions.";"**Answer:** B) The performance can significantly degrade due to increased overhead from method calls and prints.

**Explanation:** Decorators add additional code (in this case, logging statements) around the original function. This adds extra steps to the execution process:
1. Function call resolution.
2. Wrapper function invocation.
3. Argument passing to the wrapper.
4. Printing the log messages.
5. Returning from the wrapper and the original function.

These extra steps can introduce noticeable performance overhead, especially if the decorated functions are called frequently or involve complex operations. The impact is more pronounced if the logging involves I/O operations like printing to a file, as these are inherently slower than simple memory operations performed during function execution."

A) The `MyClass` will successfully log that an instance was created.

B) An error will be raised because `MyClass` does not implement all abstract methods.

C) The `log_creation` decorator will not work because it cannot be applied to a class with a metaclass.

D) The `AbstractMeta` metaclass will prevent any instances of `MyClass` from being created.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `MyClass` will successfully log that an instance was created.

Explanation: In the provided code, `MyClass` is defined with both a metaclass (`AbstractMeta`) and a decorator (`log_creation`). When `MyClass` is instantiated, the `AbstractMeta` checks if all methods are abstract. Since `my_method` is not implemented (as it's abstract), an error would normally be raised before reaching the `log_creation` decorator. However, due to the `metaclass=AbstractMeta` syntax, the metaclass is applied first. This means that the `AbstractMeta` will raise a `TypeError` indicating that all methods must be abstract, and it will never reach the `log_creation` decorator. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

B) An error will be raised because `MyClass` does not implement all abstract methods.

Explanation: This statement is correct. When `MyClass` is instantiated, `AbstractMeta` checks if all methods in the class are abstract. Since `my_method` is not implemented (it's marked with `@abstractmethod`), an error will be raised indicating that not all methods are abstract.

C) The `log_creation` decorator will not work because it cannot be applied to a class with a metaclass.

Explanation: This statement is incorrect. While it might seem counterintuitive, decorators can still be used on classes defined with metaclasses. The `log_creation` decorator wraps the original class in a new class (`WrappedClass`) that logs creation and then delegates to the original class. Therefore, option C is not applicable.

D) The `AbstractMeta` metaclass will prevent any instances of `MyClass` from being created.

Explanation: This statement is incorrect. As previously explained, the `AbstractMeta` metaclass checks if all methods are abstract but does not directly prevent instance creation. It only raises an error if it finds that not all methods are implemented as abstract. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

The correct answer is B) An error will be raised because `MyClass` does not implement all abstract methods."

B) HELLO, I AM AN EMPLOYEE!

Explanation: The code defines a metaclass `Meta` that adds a `greet` method to any class it decorates. Then, the `Employee` class is decorated with both the `Meta` metaclass and a simple decorator `greet_decorator`. The `greet_decorator` modifies the `greet` method of the decorated class by making its output uppercase.

A) Implement a global lock instead of using an instance lock.
B) Use multiprocessing instead of threading.
C) Change the increment method to be atomic by removing the lock.
D) Use asyncio for asynchronous execution.";"Answer: B) Use multiprocessing instead of threading.

Explanation: While both threading and multiprocessing can be used to achieve parallelism in Python, they have different use cases due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). In a multi-threaded application, if threads are CPU-bound (i.e., performing heavy computations), the GIL will still limit performance because only one thread can execute at a time. Multiprocessing, on the other hand, allows true parallel execution by creating separate Python processes, each with its own Python interpreter and GIL. This is beneficial when dealing with CPU-bound tasks, as it eliminates the overhead of the GIL and allows for efficient use of multiple processors. In this scenario, since the task involves updating a shared counter (a potentially CPU-bound operation), multiprocessing would provide better performance scaling compared to threading."

D) None of the above

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Waiting for timer...  
   Timer expired after 3 seconds  
   Continuing after 2 seconds  

Explanation: The `AsyncTimer` class is designed to be used as a context manager, creating an asynchronous task that runs in the background. When entering the context, it starts an asyncio sleep coroutine that will run for the specified timeout and then print a message. However, since the coroutine does not wait for this timer to complete, it immediately prints ""Waiting for timer..."" and continues execution of `main`. The `AsyncTimer` class itself does not have any influence on when its context manager exits or re-enters; it only manages the lifecycle of the async task created in `__enter__`.

The correct behavior will be:
1. ""Waiting for timer..."" printed immediately as the context manager enters.
2. The main coroutine continues to run and prints ""Continuing after 2 seconds"".
3. After 3 seconds, if the task hasn't already been cancelled (which it won't have), it would print ""Timer expired after 3 seconds"". However, this part is not reached because the context manager does not wait for the timer to expire before exiting.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to ensure all instances of a class have a specific attribute:

```python
class EnsureAttribute(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['required_attribute'] = 'I must be here'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=EnsureAttribute):
    pass

# Create an instance of MyClass and print the value of required_attribute
instance = MyClass()
print(instance.required_attribute)
```

Which of the following statements is true about the behavior of this code?

A) When `MyClass` is instantiated, it will raise an AttributeError because 'required_attribute' has not been explicitly defined.

B) The `__new__` method of the metaclass `EnsureAttribute` ensures that every subclass of `MyClass` also inherits the `required_attribute`.

C) The value of `instance.required_attribute` will be 'I must be here'.

D) Instances of `MyClass` cannot have their own definition for `required_attribute`.";"C) The value of `instance.required_attribute` will be 'I must be here'.

Explanation:
The metaclass `EnsureAttribute` modifies the dictionary of any class it is applied to by adding a new key-value pair, setting `'required_attribute'` to `'I must be here'`. Since this modification happens at the time the class is defined (not when an instance is created), every instance of `MyClass` will have the attribute `required_attribute` with the specified value."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `AsyncTimer` class defines a context manager that waits for 1 second before returning ""Timer done"".

B) The `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods are not required to be `async`.

C) When used in an `async with` statement, the event loop does not start automatically.

D) The `AsyncTimer` class can be used both as a context manager and an iterator.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) is incorrect because the timeout set in the constructor of `AsyncTimer` is 2 seconds, not 1 second.

B) is incorrect. Both `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods must be asynchronous if they are being used with an `async with` statement.

C) is correct. When using an `async with` statement, the event loop does start automatically as long as it is running when the statement is executed.

D) is incorrect. The `AsyncTimer` class cannot be used as an iterator because it only defines methods for context management (`__aenter__` and `__aexit__`).";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a class method `greet` to all classes defined with it:

```python
class GreetMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f""Hello from {name}!""

Which of the following statements is true about the above code?

A) The `greet` method will not be added to any class defined with the `GreetMeta` metaclass.

B) When a new class is created using `GreetMeta`, it automatically inherits from all base classes passed to it.

C) The `greet` method can be called on any instance of a class that uses `GreetMeta` as its metaclass, and it will return ""Hello from <ClassName>!"", where `<ClassName>` is the name of the class.

D) If a class inherits from another class that also uses `GreetMeta`, the `greet` method will be duplicated in both classes.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The `greet` method can be called on any instance of a class that uses `GreetMeta` as its metaclass, and it will return ""Hello from <ClassName>!"", where `<ClassName>` is the name of the class.

Explanation:
- A metaclass in Python is a class whose instances are classes. The `GreetMeta` metaclass defines a new method called `greet` when creating any class that uses it as its metaclass.
- This method is added to each class in its dictionary (`dct`) during the creation of the class by overriding the `__new__` method of `type`.
- Therefore, any instance of a class defined with this metaclass can call `greet`, and it will return the greeting message with the class name dynamically inserted.
- Options A, B, and D are incorrect because:
  - Option A is false because `greet` is indeed added to all classes using `GreetMeta`.
  - Option B is misleading as a metaclass does not change inheritance; it only affects how the class itself is created and configured.
  - Option D is incorrect because the method is not duplicated but rather shared across all instances of the class that use this metaclass.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

3. How does the `WrappedClass` created by the decorator interact with the `Derived` class?

Select all correct options:
A) ""Creating class Derived""
B) ""Decorator initialized""
C) ""Method called""
D) The `WrappedClass` inherits from `Base`";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer:** B, C

**Explanation:**

1. When the code is executed, the following will be printed:
   - ""Creating class Derived"" because of the metaclass `Meta`.
   - ""Decorator initialized"" because of the decorator `decorator`.
   - ""Method called"" because `obj.method()` is called on an instance of `Derived`.

2. Using a metaclass and a decorator in this way affects the class creation process by:
   - Changing how the class is created and initialized, as shown by the output.
   - Demonstrating that decorators can be used to modify or extend classes dynamically.

3. The `WrappedClass` created by the decorator interacts with the `Derived` class as follows:
   - `WrappedClass` inherits from `Base`, so it must provide an implementation for the abstract method `method`.
   - When an instance of `Derived` is created, it actually creates an instance of `WrappedClass` because of the decorator.
   - This means that when `obj.method()` is called, it calls the overridden method in `WrappedClass`.

Option A and D are incorrect as they do not match the output or interaction described."

D) No error is raised, but the value of `b` is ignored and set to `None`.";"[B] A `TypeError` is raised because the attribute `b` is not an integer.

Explanation: When you attempt to create an instance of `MyClass`, the metaclass `TypeEnforcer` checks each attribute in the class dictionary. It finds that the attribute `b` has a value of `'string'`, which is not an integer, and thus raises a `TypeError`.

This code defines an `AsyncCache` class that caches data fetched asynchronously. When the `get` method is called with a key, it first checks if the data is in the cache. If not, it fetches the data using the `fetch_data` coroutine and stores it in the cache before returning it.

**Question:** What will be the output of this script, assuming that the network request simulates by `asyncio.sleep(1)` takes exactly 1 second per request?

A) `[None, None, None, None, None]`

B) `[Data for 0, Data for 1, Data for 2, Data for 3, Data for 4]`

C) `[Data for 0, Data for 1, Data for 2, Data for 3, 'Data for 4']`

D) `[Data for 0, None, None, None, None]`

[ANSWER]
B) `[Data for 0, Data for 1, Data for 2, Data for 3, Data for 4]`

Explanation: Each `get` call is awaited in the `main` function. Because these are all awaited concurrently using `asyncio.gather`, they should all start executing at the same time and complete after approximately 1 second each due to the simulated network delay. Therefore, all data will be fetched and cached, and the final output will contain the strings representing the data for keys 0 through 4.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

In this setup, the `Task` class uses both a decorator (`timer_decorator`) and a metaclass (`TimerMeta`). The decorator is applied to all callable attributes of the class, and the metaclass also ensures that any new method added to the class will be wrapped by the decorator.

Given this code, if you create an instance of `Task` and call both `task_1` and `task_2`, what output would you expect?

B) Only `task_2` will print execution time.
C) Both methods will print the execution time before returning.
D) An error will occur because the decorator is not properly applied.";"[C] Both methods will print the execution time before returning.

Explanation: The metaclass `TimerMeta` dynamically decorates all callable attributes (methods in this case) of any class that uses it.

Consider the following code snippet that uses Python's asyncio library for asynchronous programming. The goal is to create a function `fetch_data` that fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently and returns the results in order of completion.

```python

async def fetch_data(url):
    # Simulate an async network request with an artificial delay
    await asyncio.sleep(2)

        print(result)

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is **not** true about this code?

A. The `fetch_data` function simulates an async network request by sleeping for 2 seconds.

B. The `main` function creates a list of tasks for each URL and uses `asyncio.gather` to execute them concurrently.

C. The `return_exceptions=True` argument in `asyncio.gather` ensures that exceptions are caught and handled gracefully, allowing the program to continue running even if some requests fail.

D. If one of the fetch operations raises an exception, the other operations will not be interrupted and will still complete.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is **D**. 

Explanation: In Python's asyncio library, when `asyncio.gather` is called with `return_exceptions=True`, it ensures that exceptions raised by any of the tasks are captured and returned in the results list as exceptions rather than raising them immediately. This allows the program to continue executing subsequent tasks even if some have failed. Therefore, statement D is not true because one failing task does not interrupt other ongoing tasks; they will complete as usual before the `asyncio.gather` call completes its execution."

A) The metaclass ensures that `DerivedClass` implements `my_method`, and the decorator prints ""Decorator is active"" before creating any instance of `DerivedClass`.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` checks if `my_method` is implemented in any class derived from it. Since `DerivedClass` implements `my_method`, no error is raised.
- The decorator `my_decorator` wraps the original class with a new class `Wrapper`. When `DerivedClass` is created, its `__init_subclass__` method is called by Python's type system, which in turn calls the `__init_subclass__` of the `Wrapper` class. This results in printing ""Decorator is active"" before the instance of `DerivedClass` is actually created.
- Therefore, when `d = DerivedClass()` is executed, it correctly prints ""Decorator is active"" and then proceeds to create an instance of `DerivedClass`."

B) `AsyncTimer` is a function that returns another function which, when called, will wait for the specified interval before executing the original function.

**Explanation**: 
The `AsyncTimer` class is defined with an initializer to set the interval. The class also defines a `__call__` method, making it callable as a decorator. When `@AsyncTimer(2)` decorates `my_task`, the `wrapper` function returned by `__call__` is assigned to `my_task`. When `my_task()` is called, it first waits for 2 seconds (as specified by `AsyncTimer(2)`) using `await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)` and then proceeds to execute the original task.

When you create an instance of `MyClass` and call its methods, the output should log each method call. However, there is a bug in this implementation that prevents it from working as expected.

Which of the following options correctly identifies the bug and provides a fix?

A) The decorator `log_method_calls` needs to be modified to accept and pass through instance information (self).
B) The metaclass should not modify callable attributes if they are already decorated.
C) The class should be instantiated using a different approach than the current one.
D) None of the above.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator `log_method_calls` needs to be modified to accept and pass through instance information (self).

Explanation: The issue in this code is that the `wrapper` function within the decorator does not receive the `self` parameter, which represents the instance of the class. As a result, when methods are called on an instance of `MyClass`, the wrapper does not have access to the instance context. To fix this, you need to modify the decorator to accept and pass through the `self` parameter correctly:

```python
def log_method_calls(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print(f""Calling {func.__name__} on {self.__class__.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        return func(self, *args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
```

By making this change, the decorator will correctly log which instance's method is being called.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses both a decorator and a metaclass:

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f""Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f""{func.__name__} returned {result}"")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'greet' in dct:
            greet = dct['greet']
            @wraps(greet)
            def new_greet(*args, **kwargs):
                print(""Before greeting"")
                result = greet(*args, **kwargs)
                print(""After greeting"")
                return result
            dct['greet'] = new_greet
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Greeting(metaclass=Meta):
    @logging_decorator
    def greet(self, name):
        return f""Hello, {name}!""
```

What will be the output of calling `Greeting().greet(""Alice"")`?

A) Hello, Alice!
B) Before greeting: Hello, Alice! After greeting:
C) Calling greet with args: (), kwargs: {'name': 'Alice'} Hello, Alice! Calling greet returned Hello, Alice!
D) Before greeting: Calling greet with args: (), kwargs: {'name': 'Alice'} Hello, Alice! Calling greet returned Hello, Alice! After greeting:";"C) Calling greet with args: (), kwargs: {'name': 'Alice'} Hello, Alice! Calling greet returned Hello, Alice!

Explanation:
- The `logging_decorator` is applied to the `greet` method using the decorator syntax. When `Greeting().greet(""Alice"")` is called, it logs the call and return values.
- The `Meta` metaclass modifies the class dictionary during the class creation process. If the `greet` method exists in the dictionary, it wraps it with an additional print statement before and after calling the original `greet` method.
- Therefore, when `Greeting().greet(""Alice"")` is executed, it first logs the call details using the `logging_decorator`, then the metaclass adds its own logging before and after the greeting message."

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to track all instances of a class. The goal is to modify this implementation so that it also counts how many times each method within the class has been called.

```python
class InstanceTrackerMeta(type):
    _instances = set()
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        cls._instances.add(instance)
        return instance

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceTrackerMeta):
    def method1(self):
        pass
    
    def method2(self):
        pass

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(f""Instances: {len(MyClass._instances)}"")  # Output should be 2
```

Modify the metaclass and class definitions to also track how many times each method is called.

A) Provide a solution that uses a dictionary in the metaclass to count method calls for each instance of the class.
B) Suggest a different approach using decorators and context managers.
C) Provide an example of using threading to manage the counting of method calls across multiple threads.
D) Propose a modification that uses a decorator within the class methods instead of changing the metaclass.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) Correct. The solution involves modifying the metaclass to include a dictionary for each instance where method names are keys and their call counts as values. Here's how you can implement it:

```python
class InstanceTrackerMeta(type):
    _instances = set()
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

                self._method_calls[func.__name__] = 0
            self._method_calls[func.__name__] += 1
            return func(self, *args, **kwargs)

    def method1(self):
        pass
    
    @InstanceTrackerMeta.count_method_calls
    def method2(self):
        pass

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

obj1.method1()
obj1.method2()
obj1.method1()  # Calling method1 twice

print(f""Instances: {len(MyClass._instances)}"")  # Output should be 2
print(f""Method1 calls for obj1: {obj1._method_calls['method1']}"")
print(f""Method2 calls for obj1: {obj1._method_calls['method2']}"")
```

Explanation:
- The metaclass `InstanceTrackerMeta` now includes a `_method_calls` dictionary for each instance.
- A static method `count_method_calls` is added to the metaclass, which wraps any class method with logic that counts how many times it has been called on an instance.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

What is the issue with the original implementation of `FunctionCallCounter`, and how can it be corrected to properly track method calls on instances of `MyClass`?

A) The decorator does not handle methods, only standalone functions.  
B) The decorator should use a class variable instead of a dictionary in the instance.  
C) The decorator should be applied using a metaclass or a class decorator to ensure correct behavior with methods.  
D) There is no issue with the implementation; it will work as expected.

C) When `asyncio.run(my_async_function())` is executed, it will first print ""Before function execution"", wait for 1 second, then print ""Function executed"" and finally print ""After function execution"".

Explanation: The decorator `AsyncDecorator` correctly handles the asynchronous nature of `my_async_function`. It prints ""Before function execution"", awaits the completion of `my_async_function`, prints ""Function executed"", and then completes its own execution by printing ""After function execution"".

A) The `increment` method will log each call, showing ""Calling method: increment"".
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print ""Calling method: __init__"".

D) The `LoggingMeta` metaclass modifies only the class attributes that are callable.";"Part 2 (Answer): A) The `increment` method will log each call, showing ""Calling method: increment"".

Explanation:
- Option A is correct because the `LoggingMeta` metaclass replaces every callable attribute of the class with a wrapped version that logs the method name before calling the original method.
- Option B is incorrect because `__init__` is not a callable attribute in this context; it's an instance method, and thus not affected by the metaclass modification.
- Option C is incorrect as well because `increment` is indeed replaced with its logged version during class creation.

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `timer` decorator will correctly measure and print the time taken to execute the `compute_sum` function.

B) The `wrapper` function inside the `timer` decorator does not capture any local variables from the `compute_sum` function, so its closure over these variables won't work properly.

C) Using a metaclass instead of a decorator for measuring execution time would have no impact on performance and readability.

D) The `compute_sum` function will not be able to run because the `timer` decorator is incorrectly implemented.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `timer` decorator will correctly measure and print the time taken to execute the `compute_sum` function.

Explanation: In Python, decorators work by wrapping a function inside another function. In this case, the `timer` decorator correctly wraps the `compute_sum` function. When `compute_sum(1000000)` is called, it will measure and print the time taken to execute the function. The `wrapper` function captures the local variables from the scope of `compute_sum`, so its closure over these variables works properly."

What happens if we change the order of `meta` and `deco` in the decorator application? Explain why this happens.

A) The program will raise an error because decorators are applied in reverse order.
B) The output of both method calls will remain unchanged.
C) The output of `obj.method()` will change to ""Hello from Deco!"", while the second call remains the same.
D) The output of `MyClass.class_method()` will change to ""Hello from Meta!"", while the first call remains the same.";"[D]
The order in which decorators are applied matters. In Python, decorators are applied from the innermost (nearest to the function/method definition) to the outermost. So if we switch the order of `meta` and `deco`, the actual application will be:

```python
@deco
@Meta
class MyClass:
    pass
```

This means that when `MyClass` is created, it first goes through the `Meta` metaclass to add the `method` attribute. Then it goes through the `deco` decorator to add the `class_method` attribute. As a result, calling `obj.method()` will still output ""Hello from Meta!"", but calling `MyClass.class_method()` will now output ""Hello from Deco!""."
"2025-09-06 16:02";"**Part 1 (Question):**

You are working on a Python project where you need to ensure that all functions in a module are correctly decorated with a custom decorator that measures the execution time of each function. The decorator should also log the name of the function and its execution time.

To achieve this, you decide to use a metaclass to automatically apply the decorator to all methods defined within any class that inherits from a base class named `TimedClass`.

Here is an example of how you might implement this:

```python
import time

def timed_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run."")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimedClassMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = timed_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class TimedClass(metaclass=TimedClassMeta):
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(1.0)
```

However, when you run the following code:

```python
def main():
    instance = TimedClass()
    instance.method1()
    instance.method2()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

You notice that the decorator does not seem to be applied correctly. The `method1` and `method2` are not being decorated.

**Question:** What is likely going wrong with the implementation of the `TimedClassMeta` metaclass? 

A) The metaclass is not properly defining new attributes in the class dictionary.  
B) The `timed_decorator` function does not correctly apply to methods that are added dynamically after the class is created.  
C) The metaclass is being overridden by another class definition elsewhere in your codebase, causing it to be ignored.  
D) The decorator is not handling asynchronous functions (coroutines).

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is A) The metaclass is not properly defining new attributes in the class dictionary.

Explanation: When a method is added dynamically to a class after its creation, the `__new__` method of the metaclass will not be called again. This means that any modifications made to the class dictionary within the `__new__` method are only applied to methods defined at the time of the class definition. Any methods added later do not automatically pass through the metaclass and thus are not decorated.

To fix this issue, you would need to ensure that the `TimedClassMeta` metaclass handles dynamic method addition or consider using a different approach to apply decorators dynamically across an entire module rather than relying on a metaclass.";"Answer format error.

C) Each `MyClass` instance will have a unique `created_at` attribute set to the time of its creation.

- This property uses a lambda function that, when called, returns the current timestamp using `datetime.now()`.
- Each time an instance of `MyClass` is created, a new `created_at` attribute is set with the timestamp at that moment.

What does this code do when run? Choose from the following options:

A) It prints `10` and then completes.
B) It raises a `TypeError`.
C) It enters an infinite loop.
D) It crashes with an unhandled exception.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) It prints `10` and then completes.

Explanation:
This code uses a metaclass to automatically convert any asynchronous method in a class into a synchronous one. When you call `obj.sync_method(5)`, it internally runs the `async_method` asynchronously using an event loop, converts its result to a synchronous value, and returns it. Thus, when printed, it correctly outputs `10`. The `AsyncMeta` metaclass checks if there is an `async_method` in the class dictionary and replaces it with a new method (`sync_method`) that runs the original asynchronous method in the event loop using `run_in_executor`, effectively making it synchronous."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes it decorates:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'greet' not in dct:
            dct['greet'] = lambda self: f""Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}""

A) `Hello from Person`  
B) `Hello from Meta`  
C) An error occurs  
D) The code will not run due to incorrect syntax";"**Answer: A) Hello from Person**

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks if the method `greet` is present in any class it decorates. If not, it adds a default `greet` method that returns a greeting string including the name of the class. When the `Person` class is defined with `metaclass=Meta`, the `greet` method is added to it automatically because it does not already have one. Therefore, when an instance of `Person` is created and its `greet` method is called, it outputs ""Hello from Person""."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of `Singleton` can be created throughout the application.

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

class Database(metaclass=Singleton):
    def query(self, sql):
        print(f""Executing query: {sql}"")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 == db2)  # True or False?
db1.query(""SELECT * FROM users"")
```

Which of the following statements is correct about the behavior of the `Database` class?

A) The output will be `False`, and each call to `query()` will print ""Executing query: SELECT * FROM users"" twice.

B) The output will be `True`, but only one query will be executed, printing ""Executing query: SELECT * FROM users"" once.

C) The output will be `True`, and both calls to `query()` will print ""Executing query: SELECT * FROM users"" twice.

D) The code will raise an error because the metaclass is not used correctly.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The output will be `True`, but only one query will be executed, printing ""Executing query: SELECT * FROM users"" once.

Explanation:

- The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that when `Database()` is called multiple times, it always returns the same instance stored in `_instances`.
- Therefore, `db1 == db2` will result in `True`, as both variables reference the same singleton instance.
- When `query()` is called on either `db1` or `db2`, only one query is executed because they are the same instance."

A) Method called  
B) Calling my_method  
C) Error - metaclass not applied  
D) None";"Answer: A) Method called  

Explanation: The metaclass `LoggingMeta` is designed to automatically wrap all callable attributes (methods) of a class it decorates with a logging wrapper. However, there's a subtle issue in the implementation of the metaclass that prevents this from working as intended.

When `__new__` is called on the metaclass to create a new class `MyClass`, it iterates over all attributes and tries to wrap callable attributes with `log_method_call`. The problem lies in how Python handles attribute access during the definition phase. When the metaclass's `__new__` method is called, the `my_method` has not yet been fully defined in the namespace of `MyClass`. Therefore, when the metaclass tries to wrap `my_method`, it sees a placeholder or an incomplete function object that has not yet been bound to its name.

As a result, the `log_method_call` method does not correctly recognize `my_method` as the target for wrapping. Instead, it wraps itself recursively, creating an infinite recursion until Python raises a `RecursionError`.

This example highlights the importance of understanding how attribute resolution and metaclass application work in Python to avoid such issues."

You are tasked with creating a decorator that logs the execution time of any function it decorates. However, this decorator should only work for functions that take no arguments. If the function takes arguments, the decorator should raise a `TypeError` indicating that the function is not supported.

Here's how you could define such a decorator:

```python

A) 
```python
start_time = time.time()
result = func(*args, **kwargs)
end_time = time.time()
print(f""Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds"")

B) 
```python
if not args and not kwargs:
    start_time = time.time()
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f""Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds"")

```python
start_time = time.time()
result = func(*args, **kwargs)
end_time = time.time()
print(f""Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds"")
return None
```

D) 
```python
if not args and not kwargs:
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
else:
    raise TypeError(""Function with arguments is not supported"")
start_time = time.time()
end_time = time.time()
print(f""Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds"")
return result

    end_time = time.time()
    print(f""Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds"")
else:
    raise TypeError(""Function with arguments is not supported"")

The correct implementation ensures that the function's execution time is logged only if it takes no arguments. If the function takes any arguments, a `TypeError` is raised, indicating that the function is not supported by this decorator. This approach provides clear and specific functionality based on the requirements."

A) When `obj1` and `obj2` are created, their class (`MyClass`) will have a `_instances` attribute set to 2.

**Explanation:** In the provided code, the metaclass `InstanceCounter` overrides the `__call__` method. This method is called whenever an instance of `MyClass` (or any other class derived from it) is created. Inside this overridden method, `_instances` is incremented each time a new instance is created, thus correctly tracking the number of instances. The attribute `_instances` is not stored in each instance but rather in the class itself (`MyClass._instances`). Therefore, after creating two instances of `MyClass`, the value of `MyClass._instances` will be 2, confirming that statement A is true and options B, C, and D are incorrect."

Explanation: When a class `MyClass` is defined with both a metaclass (`Meta`) and a decorator (`my_decorator`), Python first creates the class using the metaclass, which prints ""Class MyClass is being created"". Then, the decorator is applied to the class, wrapping it in another class `Wrapper`, which adds a new method `wrapper_method`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, both the original class and the wrapper are involved. The wrapper's initialization happens first, printing ""Wrapper method called"", and then the original class's `__init__` method runs, printing ""MyClass instance created""."

A) The `cache` decorator correctly caches results for the `fibonacci` function.
B) The cache mechanism will not work as expected because it does not handle different keyword argument orders.
C) The cache dictionary can grow indefinitely, leading to a memory leak.
D) The `functools.wraps(func)` is unnecessary here and can be removed without affecting the functionality.";"A) The `cache` decorator correctly caches results for the `fibonacci` function.

**Explanation:** 
The `cache` decorator uses a dictionary to store the results of expensive function calls, which is intended to improve performance by avoiding repeated calculations. However, the current implementation does not handle different keyword argument orders correctly because it converts the dictionary of keyword arguments into a tuple, which will be different for calls with the same positional arguments but different keyword arguments. This means that each combination of positional and keyword arguments is treated as a unique key, potentially leading to incorrect caching behavior if the function's usage includes multiple ways of calling it with the same parameters.

B) The cache mechanism will not work as expected because it does not handle different keyword argument orders.

**Explanation:** 
As explained above, the current implementation of the `cache` decorator does not account for different keyword argument orders. This means that each combination of positional and keyword arguments is treated as a unique key, potentially leading to incorrect caching behavior if the function's usage includes multiple ways of calling it with the same parameters.

C) The cache dictionary can grow indefinitely, leading to a memory leak.

**Explanation:** 
The `cache` decorator uses a dictionary (`cached_results`) to store cached results. If this dictionary grows indefinitely without bounds (i.e., if there is no mechanism to expire or clean up old entries), it could lead to a memory leak because the dictionary would consume more and more memory over time. However, in this specific example, we do not have such an issue since the `fibonacci` function has a limited range of inputs.

D) The `functools.wraps(func)` is unnecessary here and can be removed without affecting the functionality.

**Explanation:** 
The `functools.wraps(func)` decorator is used to preserve the metadata (like `__name__`, `__doc__`, etc.) of the original function when it is decorated. While this isn't strictly necessary for the caching mechanism to work, it's often a good practice to include it to ensure that the decorated function behaves as expected in terms of its identity and documentation. Removing `functools.wraps(func)` would not prevent the code from functioning but could make debugging harder if issues arise."
"2025-09-11 00:02";"";"**Part 1 (Question):**

Imagine you are developing a web application that requires handling large datasets efficiently. You need to implement a caching mechanism that can dynamically adjust its size based on the current load of the application. The cache should be able to track which items are least recently used and remove them when necessary. 

You decide to use a metaclass along with a custom descriptor to create this flexible and efficient caching system.

1. **Define a metaclass `CacheMeta` that inherits from `type`. This metaclass should override the `__new__` method to dynamically adjust the cache size based on the current load of the application.**
2. **Create a custom descriptor class `LRUCacheDescriptor` that can be used as an attribute in a class definition to instantiate a least recently used (LRU) cache. The descriptor should handle adding, retrieving, and removing items from the cache.**
3. **Define a class `DataHandler` using `CacheMeta` as its metaclass and include an `LRUCacheDescriptor` named `cache`.**

```python
# BEGIN SOLUTION
class CacheMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Implement logic to adjust cache size based on current load
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class LRUCacheDescriptor:
    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        # Return an empty LRU Cache here
        pass
    
    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        # Set the cache value if it's a valid cache object
        pass

class DataHandler(metaclass=CacheMeta):
    cache = LRUCacheDescriptor()
# END SOLUTION
```

**Which of the following statements is true regarding the implementation above?**

A) The `CacheMeta` metaclass can dynamically adjust the size of the cache based on the current load.
B) The `LRUCacheDescriptor` correctly implements methods for adding, retrieving, and removing items from an LRU Cache.
C) Both A and B are true.
D) None of the above.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) Both A and B are true.

Explanation:

A) In order to dynamically adjust the cache size based on the current load, we need a way to monitor the load. This can be done in various ways depending on how you define ""current load"" (e.g., number of requests per minute). The `__new__` method of `CacheMeta` is where such logic would go.

B) To correctly implement methods for adding, retrieving, and removing items from an LRU Cache, the descriptor should handle these operations. Typically, this involves maintaining a data structure like a dictionary to store cache entries and possibly another data structure to keep track of the order of entries (e.g., using `collections.OrderedDict`).

While this solution provides a starting point, it lacks some details such as how to monitor load or implement LRU caching logic. However, focusing on these aspects would further challenge the understanding of metaclasses and descriptors in advanced Python programming."

**Answer:**
B) It decorates an asynchronous function to ensure it runs within an asyncio event loop.

C) Both ""Fetching data..."" and ""Data fetched""

Explanation:
- `AsyncDecorator` is a decorator that wraps around another coroutine (`fetch_data`). When called, it uses `asyncio.run()` to execute the coroutine in the current asyncio event loop.

C) The `increment_counter` function is not correctly decorated.

D) The threading library is being used improperly.";"Part 2 (Answer):

The correct answer is B) Multiple threads can access and modify the global variable `counter` simultaneously, leading to a race condition.

Explanation: 

In this code, multiple threads are created that all call the `increment_counter` function concurrently. The `synchronized` decorator attempts to ensure that only one thread executes the `increment_counter` function at a time by using a lock. However, due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which does not allow true parallel execution of Python bytecode even in multi-threaded applications on CPUs with multiple cores, all threads may still be running simultaneously at the machine code level.

The race condition occurs because each thread reads the current value of `counter`, increments it by 1, and then writes the new value back to the global variable. If two or more threads execute this sequence of operations concurrently, they may read the same value of `counter`, both increment it, and write back the same incremented value, effectively losing one increment.

To avoid race conditions in scenarios like this, you would need a thread-safe counter implementation or use a lock that ensures true atomicity (e.g., using `threading.Lock()` directly in a way that prevents other threads from accessing any shared resources during the critical section)."

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Add a new method 'greet' to all classes decorated by this metaclass
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f""Hello, I am an instance of {self.__class__.__name__}""

@Meta
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Usage
obj = MyClass(""Example"")
print(obj.greet())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `greet` method will be added to instances of all classes decorated by `Meta`, but not to `MyClass` itself.

B) The `greet` method will be added to `MyClass` and all instances of `MyClass`.

C) The `greet` method will only be accessible when defining a new class with `Meta` as its metaclass, but not on existing classes.

D) The code will raise an error because the `greet` method cannot be defined in the metaclass's `__new__` method.

### Part 2 (Answer)

B) The `greet` method will be added to `MyClass` and all instances of `MyClass`.

**Explanation:**
The metaclass `Meta` is used to dynamically add a `greet` method to any class that uses it as its metaclass. This means that when you define a new class like `MyClass`, the `greet` method is added directly to `MyClass`. As a result, instances of `MyClass` can also call this `greet` method.

The key point here is that metaclasses allow for modifications to the class definition at the time of class creation, making it possible to dynamically add methods or attributes to classes.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

"2025-09-13 00:02";"**Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of the `Singleton` class can be created.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Usage
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # This should print True if the implementation is correct.
```

What additional feature could be added to this `Singleton` class using metaclasses to make it thread-safe?

A. Using `threading.Lock()` inside the `__call__` method  
B. Using decorators on the metaclass methods  
C. Creating a subclass of `SingletonMeta` that adds locking logic  
D. Adding a static method `instance()` to `Singleton`

**Part 2: Answer**

The correct answer is A. Using `threading.Lock()` inside the `__call__` method.

Explanation:
To ensure that the singleton pattern works correctly in a multi-threaded environment, it's crucial to prevent multiple threads from creating separate instances of the class simultaneously. This can be achieved by adding a lock mechanism to control access to the `__call__` method. Here is how you could modify the `SingletonMeta` metaclass to include locking:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock: threading.Lock = threading.Lock()

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
                cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]
```

Now, when multiple threads try to create an instance of `Singleton` simultaneously, the lock will ensure that only one thread can enter the critical section at a time, thus preventing the creation of multiple instances. This makes the singleton pattern thread-safe with this metaclass implementation.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."
"2025-09-13 08:02";"**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a decorator which logs function execution times. However, it is not functioning as intended:

```python
import time

def log_execution_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f""Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start} seconds."")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_execution_time
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

When `compute_sum(1000000)` is called, it logs the execution time correctly. However, if you were to call `compute_sum` again without restarting the script, the decorator does not log an additional execution time. Explain why and suggest a modification to the `log_execution_time` decorator so that it can accurately measure and log the execution time for each individual function call.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A correct answer is B: Use a closure or lambda function inside the wrapper that captures the start time and logs it when the function is called again.

Explanation:
The current implementation of `log_execution_time` uses a single start time, which gets captured at the first call. When `compute_sum` is called again, the already captured `start` time does not update, leading to an incorrect execution time calculation for subsequent calls.

A modification could be made to capture the start time inside the wrapper function that gets executed with each call to `compute_sum`, thus ensuring that it logs the correct execution time each time the function is invoked. For example:

```python
def log_execution_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()  # Capture start time here for each call
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f""Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start} seconds."")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_execution_time
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

B) Counting down in 3 seconds... and then Counting down in 5 seconds...
C) The output alternates between ""Counting down in 5 seconds..."" and ""Counting down in 3 seconds...""
D) The code raises an exception";"**Answer: C**

Explanation: In the provided Python code, both `timer1` and `timer2` are instances of `AsyncTimer`. When they call their `countdown` method asynchronously using `asyncio.create_task`, both tasks run concurrently. Since both tasks are infinite loops, they will continue to print messages every `interval` seconds simultaneously. Because the event loop runs them in parallel, you can expect that both ""Counting down in 5 seconds..."" and ""Counting down in 3 seconds..."" messages will be printed alternately as they complete their sleep intervals."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of the class `Singleton` can be created, no matter how many times it is instantiated.

A. The `Singleton` class ensures that only one instance of itself can be created. When `s2.value` is accessed, it prints `None`.

B. The `Singleton` class allows multiple instances to be created. When `s2.value` is accessed, it prints `42`.

C. The `Singleton` class ensures that only one instance of itself can be created. When `s2.value` is accessed, it also prints `42`.

D. The code will raise an error because the metaclass `SingletonMeta` does not properly handle instantiation.";"**Correct Answer: C**

Explanation:
The `SingletonMeta` class uses a dictionary `_instances` to store instances of classes that use this metaclass. When an instance is created, it checks if the class already exists in the `_instances` dictionary. If not, it creates one using the superclass's `__call__` method and stores it. Any subsequent calls for the same class will return the stored instance.

In the case of `Singleton`, when `s1` is created, an instance is stored with `SingletonMeta._instances[Singleton] = s1`. When `s2` is created, since `Singleton` already exists in `_instances`, `s2` references the same object as `s1`. Therefore, any changes made to attributes of `s1` are reflected in `s2`. Thus, when `s2.value` is accessed, it prints `42`."

You are tasked with creating a Python script that utilizes asyncio and coroutines to simulate a scenario where multiple tasks run concurrently, each fetching data from an API. The goal is to understand how to manage asynchronous tasks efficiently.

Write a function `fetch_data(url)` that uses the `aiohttp` library to fetch data from a given URL asynchronously. Then, create another function `run_tasks(urls)` that takes a list of URLs and runs them concurrently using asyncio, returning a list of fetched data in the order of the input list.

Ensure that your code handles exceptions gracefully by catching any errors that occur during the fetching process and continuing with the next task.

Here's an example to get you started:
```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

# Define the function fetch_data(url) here
# Use aiohttp.ClientSession() to create a session and make async requests

# Define the function run_tasks(urls) here
# Use asyncio.gather() to run tasks concurrently and wait for all of them to complete

# Example usage:
urls = [
    'https://api.example.com/data1',
    'https://api.example.com/data2',
    'https://api.example.com/data3'
]
results = asyncio.run(run_tasks(urls))
print(results)
```";"Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is not provided directly, as the task requires coding and running a solution. Here's an example of how you might implement the functions:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        try:
            async with session.get(url) as response:
                return await response.json()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f""Error fetching {url}: {e}"")
            return None

async def run_tasks(urls):
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return [result for result in results if result is not None]

# Example usage:
urls = [
    'https://api.example.com/data1',
    'https://api.example.com/data2',
    'https://api.example.com/data3'
]
results = asyncio.run(run_tasks(urls))
print(results)
```

In this solution, `fetch_data` is an asynchronous function that fetches data from a given URL using `aiohttp.ClientSession()`. The `run_tasks` function creates a list of tasks to be run concurrently and uses `asyncio.gather()` to wait for all of them to complete. It also handles exceptions by catching errors during the fetching process and skipping the task if an error occurs.

The example usage demonstrates how to run the `run_tasks` function with a list of URLs, waiting for the results using `asyncio.run()`. The results are printed, showing the fetched data in the order of the input list."

D) The use of `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` ensures that all tasks complete before printing the result.";"**Answer: D)**

The use of `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` in the `main` function does indeed ensure that all tasks complete before moving on to the next line, which is where the result is printed. This guarantees that the data is fully populated when `get_data` is called.

You are tasked with designing a Python system that manages resources efficiently. You decide to use a metaclass to create a singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of a class can be created across the entire application. Additionally, you want to ensure that the singleton is thread-safe and handles resource initialization lazily.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock: threading.Lock = threading.Lock()

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
                cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Resource(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = None

    def initialize(self, data):
        self.data = data

# Usage example
def main():
    resource1 = Resource()
    resource2 = Resource()

    assert resource1 is resource2  # Both should be the same instance

    resource1.initialize(""Data"")
    print(resource2.data)  # Should print ""Data""

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

However, when running this code in a multi-threaded environment, you notice that both `resource1` and `resource2` are not the same instance. Your suspicion is that there might be an issue with how the lock is being used or how instances are being stored.

**Question:**  
Identify the potential issues in the given code snippet and provide a corrected version of the metaclass to ensure thread-safe lazy initialization of the singleton.

A) The lock is not acquired correctly.  
B) Instances are not being stored correctly.  
C) Both A and B  
D) There are no issues with the current implementation.

**Part 2: Answer**

**Answer:** C) Both A and B

Explanation:

In this corrected version, we ensure that `_instances` is thread-safe by using a separate lock. However, in practice, it's often better to use `threading.local()` for such cases to avoid global locks altogether:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = threading.local()

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(cls._instances, cls):
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Resource(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = None

    def initialize(self, data):
        self.data = data

# Usage example remains the same

This approach avoids the need for explicit locking and is generally more efficient."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a new attribute to all instances of a class dynamically:

```python
class AddAttribute(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['new_attribute'] = 'added'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddAttribute):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.new_attribute)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `__new__` method of the metaclass is not called when creating an instance of `MyClass`.

B) When you create an instance of `MyClass`, the `new_attribute` is added to the class itself, not to the instances.

C) The value of `new_attribute` will be 'added' for all instances of `MyClass`.

D) The `metaclass=AddAttribute` argument in the class definition is redundant because it's set to a built-in type `type`.

### Part 2 (Answer)
C) The value of `new_attribute` will be 'added' for all instances of `MyClass`.

**Explanation:**
The metaclass `AddAttribute` is correctly implemented. It modifies the dictionary of each class it defines by adding the key-value pair `'new_attribute': 'added'`. Therefore, when an instance of `MyClass` is created, this new attribute is added to the instance, and its value will be 'added'.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

A) `TypeError: All classes must implement greet method`
B) `None`
C) `Hello!`
D) `Hi!`

[ANSWER]
A) `TypeError: All classes must implement greet method`

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks if each class it creates has a `greet` method. If not, it raises a `TypeError`. In this case, the class `Greeter` does not define a `greet` method, so when we try to create an instance of `Polite`, which inherits from `Greeter` and defines a `greet` method, Python raises a `TypeError` because `Polite` is created before its parent `Greeter` implements the required `greet` method.";"Answer format error.

A) The `task` function will run synchronously because it uses the `await` keyword inside a non-async context.

B) All tasks start immediately and finish in order due to the use of `asyncio.sleep`.

C) The `main` function collects all tasks into a list and runs them concurrently using `asyncio.gather`.

D) If you try to run this code without asyncio.run(main()), an error will occur because Python cannot handle asynchronous functions outside of their event loop.";"[ANSWER] C) The `main` function collects all tasks into a list and runs them concurrently using `asyncio.gather`.

Explanation: This statement is correct. In the provided code, the `main` function creates a list of tasks using a list comprehension. Each task is an instance of the `task` coroutine with different parameters. When `await asyncio.gather(*tasks)` is called in `main`, it schedules all tasks to run concurrently and waits for them to complete before exiting. This demonstrates how `asyncio.gather` can be used to manage multiple asynchronous tasks efficiently.

Option A is incorrect because `await` is used inside an `async def` function, making the entire function asynchronous.

Option B is also incorrect because, although each task starts immediately due to the event loop scheduling, they do not finish in order. The timing of completion depends on the specified sleep duration for each task.

Option D is correct and elaborates on why running this code without `asyncio.run(main())` would result in an error. `asyncio.run()` is required to start the event loop and run the coroutine until it completes, which cannot be done outside a non-async context."
"2025-09-18 08:02";"";"**Question:** Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a decorator for a coroutine function to ensure it only runs once. However, it does not work as expected. Identify what is wrong with the code and provide a corrected version of the decorator.

A. The decorator does not properly handle the asynchronous context of `func`.  
B. There is no need for a nonlocal variable `has_run` inside the wrapper.  
C. The decorator should return an instance method instead of a coroutine function.  
D. The usage of `nonlocal` is incorrect in this context.

**Answer:** A. The decorator does not properly handle the asynchronous context of `func`.

**Explanation:** The issue with the original code is that it attempts to use `await` outside of an asynchronous function. In Python, `await` can only be used inside functions marked as `async`. To fix this, the wrapper itself should be defined as an `async def`. Here's the corrected version:

C) It throws a TypeError because `_instances` is not initialized in the metaclass.

D) It enters an infinite loop due to recursive instantiation.";"A) It correctly raises a ValueError because an instance with those arguments already exists.

Explanation: The intention of the `UniqueMeta` metaclass is to ensure that no two instances of classes using this metaclass are created with the same arguments. However, in this implementation, `_instances` is not initialized in the metaclass itself. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access or set `_instances`. To fix this, you would need to initialize `_instances` in the `__init__` method of the metaclass:

```python
class UniqueMeta(type):
    _instances = {}  # Initialize here

C) The output depends on whether the Singleton pattern was successfully implemented.

Explanation: The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it. In the provided code, the metaclass `Singleton` attempts to implement this pattern by storing instances in a dictionary `_instances`. However, the code is incomplete and does not fully enforce the Singleton pattern correctly. Specifically, there are no checks to ensure that if an instance already exists, it is returned instead of creating a new one. Additionally, the dictionary `_instances` is not thread-safe, which could lead to multiple instances being created in a multi-threaded environment. Therefore, the output of `print(a is b)` cannot be guaranteed and depends on how robustly the Singleton pattern was implemented and whether any threading issues were handled properly."

A. Both prepend_decorated and AttributeDecorator dynamically modify class attributes by prepending ""decorated_"" to all string attributes.

Explanation:
- The `AttributeDecorator` metaclass correctly modifies class attributes during the class creation process, renaming any string attribute to be prefixed with ""decorated_"". This is confirmed in the example where `ExampleClass.string_attr` becomes `ExampleClass.decorated_string_attr`.
- The `prepend_decorated` function also dynamically modifies class attributes. It iterates over all attributes of a given class instance, checks if they are strings, and creates new string attributes with ""decorated_"" prepended to their original names. This is demonstrated in the example where `AnotherExampleClass.string_attr` becomes `AnotherExampleClass.decorated_string_attr`.

Both mechanisms achieve the goal of dynamically modifying class attributes by prepending ""decorated_"", thus making option A the correct answer."

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to add functionality to a class. The decorator is intended to ensure that an instance of the class has not been accessed before it is initialized (i.e., its `__init__` method has been called).

```python
def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}

What is the issue with this implementation of the `singleton` decorator?

A. The decorator does not properly handle multiple instances of the same class.
B. The decorator prevents the creation of any new instances after the first one.
C. The decorator incorrectly reuses an instance's attributes instead of creating a new one.
D. The decorator fails to initialize the instance correctly.";"C. The decorator incorrectly reuses an instance's attributes instead of creating a new one.

Explanation: The issue with this implementation lies in how the `singleton` decorator handles class instantiation. It uses a dictionary `instances` to store instances of classes, but it does not check if the instance has already been initialized by calling its `__init__` method. When you try to create another instance, the `get_instance` function checks if the class is already in the `instances` dictionary and returns the existing instance without calling `__init__` again. This means that if `MyClass(10)` is created first and then `MyClass(20)`, both variables `obj1` and `obj2` will reference the same instance, and `obj2.value` will still be 10 instead of 20, as expected."

D) The program will hang

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**Answer:** C) ""Timer started\nTimer finished""

**Explanation:**
The provided code defines an `AsyncTimer` class that implements both the `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods, making it a context manager. When used with the `async with` statement in the `main()` function, the flow of execution works as follows:

1. The `async with` statement first calls the `__aenter__` method of the `AsyncTimer` instance.
2. Inside `__aenter__`, the program awaits a sleep for 2 seconds using `await asyncio.sleep(self.delay)`.
3. After the sleep is complete, ""Timer started"" is printed.
4. Control then transfers to the next line after the `async with` block.
5. The `async with` statement next calls the `__aexit__` method of the `AsyncTimer` instance.
6. Inside `__aexit__`, it prints ""Timer finished"".

Thus, both ""Timer started"" and ""Timer finished"" are printed in that order."

C) Result 1: 7.0, Result 2: 11.0 (First call takes 0.5 seconds, second takes 1.0 seconds)  
D) None of the above";"Answer: B

Explanation:
The output is Result 1: 7.0, Result 2: 11.0 (Both calls to add take 0.5 seconds).

- The `timed` decorator measures and prints the time taken by any function it decorates.
- The `TimeTracker` class uses a singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of `TimeTracker` is created and reused.
- Since both method calls in `main()` use the same instance of `TimeTracker`, the `add` method takes 0.5 seconds for each call, as it simulates a time-consuming task with `time.sleep(0.5)`. The decorator does not cache results or re-run methods; it simply measures the execution time of the method each time it is called.
- Therefore, both calls to `tracker.add` take 0.5 seconds, making option B the correct answer."
"2025-09-22 00:02";"Part 1 (Question): 

Imagine you have a Python script that needs to handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations efficiently. You decide to use `asyncio` for the asynchronous tasks but need a way to seamlessly integrate it with existing synchronous code without rewriting everything as an asynchronous function.

You create a decorator called `run_async_if_needed` that checks if the current execution context allows for asynchronous calls (i.e., if there's an event loop running). If it does, the decorator should run the wrapped function asynchronously using `asyncio.run()`. Otherwise, it should just call the function synchronously.

Here’s the initial implementation of `run_async_if_needed`:

```python
import asyncio

def run_async_if_needed(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return await func(*args, **kwargs)
    
    def sync_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)

    if asyncio.get_event_loop().is_running():
        return wrapper
    else:
        return sync_wrapper

# Example usage
@run_async_if_needed
async def async_task():
    print(""Running an asynchronous task"")

def sync_task():
    print(""Running a synchronous task"")
```

Now, consider the following scenario:

1. You have an event loop running.
2. You call `sync_task()` within a context where there is no active event loop (e.g., in a new thread).
3. You attempt to call `async_task()` from that same thread.

Which of the following statements best describes what will happen when you run this code?

A) Both `sync_task()` and `async_task()` will execute synchronously.
B) `sync_task()` will execute synchronously, but `async_task()` will raise an error.
C) Both `sync_task()` and `async_task()` will attempt to create a new event loop and execute asynchronously.
D) `sync_task()` will execute synchronously, and `async_task()` will be executed asynchronously using the current event loop.";"Part 2 (Answer):

A) Both `sync_task()` and `async_task()` will execute synchronously.

**Explanation:**
- When `sync_task()` is called with an active event loop, the decorator checks if there's an event loop running. Since there is one, it uses the synchronous wrapper (`sync_wrapper`), which simply calls the function without any change.
- For `async_task()`, even though there is an event loop, the decorator checks and determines that since it’s already running inside an async context (i.e., within a function marked with `@run_async_if_needed` or called from another async function), it should not attempt to run it again. Thus, it calls the synchronous wrapper (`sync_wrapper`) which simply returns the result of `async_task()`, effectively executing it synchronously without creating a new event loop."

A) This is dynamic
B) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'dynamic_attribute'
C) TypeError: metaclass conflict
D) SyntaxError: invalid syntax";"A) This is dynamic

The correct answer is A) This is dynamic. The metaclass `DynamicAttributeMeta` modifies the dictionary of any class it decorates by adding a new key-value pair, where 'dynamic_attribute' is the key and 'This is dynamic' is its value. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, this new attribute becomes part of the instance's attributes, allowing access to 'dynamic_attribute'."

A) It defines a class with a method that sleeps for 2 seconds.

C) It adds a timer decorator only to instance methods of the class.  
D) It demonstrates how to create a singleton pattern using a metaclass.";"Part 2 (Answer): B) It creates a metaclass that automatically decorates all methods in the class to measure their execution time.

The correct answer is B. The `TimeMeta` metaclass, when used as the metaclass for `MyClass`, scans through its attributes during class creation (`__new__`). If an attribute is callable (i.e., it's a method), the `timer` decorator is applied to that method, allowing any instance of `MyClass` to call this decorated method and automatically measure how long each method takes to execute. The usage demonstrates calling a decorated method `my_method` on an instance of `MyClass`, which prints the execution time."

Consider the following Python code that aims to create a simple logging system using metaclasses. The goal is to ensure that every class defined with this metaclass will automatically include a method `log_creation()` which logs when an instance of the class is created.

Which of the following statements is true regarding the code above?

A) The `log_creation` method will be added to every class using the `MetaLogger` metaclass, and calling it on an instance of any such class will print a timestamp.

B) When you create an instance of `MyClass`, `log_creation()` will raise an error because it is not defined in the class body.

C) The `log_creation` method will be added to every class using the `MetaLogger` metaclass, but calling it on an instance of any such class will raise an error because instances do not have this method.

D) The `log_creation` method will only be available in `MyClass` and not in other classes that use `MetaLogger`.";"**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `log_creation` method will be added to every class using the `MetaLogger` metaclass, and calling it on an instance of any such class will print a timestamp.

Explanation: In Python, metaclasses are powerful tools that allow you to modify or extend class behavior at the time of their creation. When `MyClass` is created with `metaclass=MetaLogger`, the metaclass's `__new__` method is invoked. This method defines a new class with an added `log_creation` method, which logs when an instance is created. Any subclass of `MyClass` (or any other class that uses `MetaLogger`) will also inherit this behavior because the method is defined in the metaclass's creation logic."

C) The decorator should use `*args` and `**kwargs` to capture all arguments, but it doesn't.
D) There's no problem with this decorator; it works as expected.

Part 2 (Answer): 

C) The decorator should use `*args` and `**kwargs` to capture all arguments, but it doesn't.

Explanation: The original decorator does not accept any arguments (`func`) that the decorated function might take. It only calls `func()` without passing any arguments if they are provided. To fix this, the inner function `wrapper` should be modified to accept and pass along any positional (`*args`) and keyword (`**kwargs`) arguments it receives from the call to `my_function()`. The corrected decorator would look like this:

```python
import time

def measure_time(func):

@measure_time

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]
**Part 2 (Answer):**

A)  
This is correct. When an instance of `Example` is created, the metaclass `LogMethodCalls` processes all attributes in the class dictionary. Since both `greet` and `farewell` are callable methods, they are wrapped by the `log_method` function defined within the metaclass. Therefore, when these methods are called on an instance of `Example`, they first log their name along with arguments before executing the original method.

B)  
Incorrect. The output should include logging information for both `greet` and `farewell` calls because the metaclass adds logging functionality to all callable methods in the class.

C)  
Incorrect. This option is missing the initial call to `__init__`, which also gets wrapped by the metaclass's logic, leading to a log message before calling the original method.

D)  
Incorrect. Both `greet` and `farewell` calls should be preceded by logging information as they are wrapped methods in the class defined with the metaclass.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

D) The `async_function` is not wrapped by the decorator.";"### Part 2 (Answer)
**Correct Answer:** B) The `time_decorator` will correctly measure the execution time of both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

**Explanation:**
The provided `time_decorator` uses Python's built-in `time.time()` function, which is designed to work with both synchronous and asynchronous operations. However, applying this decorator directly to an asynchronous function (like `async_function`) will not work as intended because `time.time()` measures the time between calling it and when the result of the function call is returned, but in the case of an async function, the actual execution may be delayed due to waiting on I/O operations.

To handle this correctly for async functions, we would need to use `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(func(*args, **kwargs))` inside the decorator when wrapping an async function.

**B) 10, None**

Explanation:
- For `MyClass`, the metaclass `Meta` checks if 'x' is in the dictionary. Since it is (`MyClass.x = 5`), it sets `y` to twice the value of `x`. Therefore, `MyClass.y` is calculated as `10`.
- For `AnotherClass`, there is no attribute `x` defined in its dictionary. The metaclass does not modify the class dictionary since 'x' is absent, so `y` remains undefined and will be `None` when accessed.

You are tasked with creating a high-performance web server that handles multiple concurrent requests. The server needs to be able to serve static files efficiently while also processing dynamic content asynchronously.

A) Implement a method `is_async_context()` to check if the current context is asynchronous, then open/close files accordingly.

B) Use Python's built-in `contextmanager` decorator from the `contextlib` module to simplify the implementation.

C) Manually check for an asynchronous context using `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` and conditionally call synchronous or asynchronous methods.

D) Implement both asynchronous and synchronous file opening/closing operations within each method, assuming that the context manager can only be used in one mode at a time.";"[ANSWER]
A) Implement a method `is_async_context()` to check if the current context is asynchronous, then open/close files accordingly.

**Explanation:** The correct approach involves checking whether the current execution context is synchronous or asynchronous. This can typically be done by trying to run an asynchronous function and catching any resulting exceptions. If an exception is caught, it indicates that the code is running in a synchronous context, allowing the synchronous file handling methods to be called. Conversely, if no exceptions are caught, the code is running asynchronously, allowing the asynchronous file handling methods to be called.

Option A correctly implements this logic by introducing an `is_async_context()` method to determine the current context and then appropriately opening or closing files based on whether the context is synchronous or asynchronous."

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and potential issues with this code?

A) The `Calculator` class will not be instantiated because the decorator fails to wrap methods properly.

B) Each method in the `Calculator` class will print its name and arguments when called, as expected.

C) The decorator only logs method calls for public methods but does not handle private or special methods (like `__init__`).

D) All method calls on an instance of `Calculator` will raise a TypeError because they are not callable after decoration.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) Each method in the `Calculator` class will print its name and arguments when called, as expected.

Explanation:

The provided code attempts to create a decorator that logs all callable methods within a class. The `_log_method_call` function uses the `@wraps` decorator from the `functools` module to preserve the metadata of the original methods. When applied to the `Calculator` class, this decorator replaces each method with its logged version.

The key issue in the code is that the line `print(f""Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")` should be outside the `if callable(func) and not name.startswith(""__""):` condition. This ensures that all methods are logged, including special (private or protected) methods. If this line is inside the condition, it will only log public methods, missing out on crucial setup and teardown operations typically encapsulated in private methods.

By correcting this oversight, each method call on an instance of `Calculator` will indeed print its name along with the arguments passed to it, as expected."

D) The execution time of `compute_sum` will be printed to the console when called.

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]  
**Part 2 (Answer):**

**";"** D

**Detailed Explanation:**

The correct answer is D. Let's break down why:

- A) The `Timer` class is not a context manager. It defines a `__call__` method, which makes it an callable object rather than a context manager. Context managers use `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.

- B) This statement is incorrect because the execution time of `compute_sum` will be printed to the console when called, as demonstrated by the code.

- C) The `Timer` class can only be used as a decorator. It does not have any attributes or behaviors that would make it suitable for use as a metaclass.

- D) This statement is true. When you call `compute_sum(1000000)`, the `Timer` decorator is invoked, which measures and prints the execution time of the function before returning its result.

Thus, option D correctly describes the behavior of the provided code snippet when using the `Timer` class as a decorator."

Explanation: The code uses `asyncio.gather` to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently. Each task simulates fetching data by sleeping for 2 seconds and then returning a string with the task ID. Since all tasks are allowed to run simultaneously, each completes within the time limit set by asyncio, so they return their expected results without any exceptions.

C) `Result 1: Value for data, Result 2: <coroutine object AsyncCache.get at 0x...>`  
D) The code will raise an error because `await` is used outside of an asynchronous context.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) `Result 1: Value for data, Result 2: Value for data`

Explanation:
The correct answer is A. Here’s why:

- When the `main()` function calls `await cache.get(""data"")` for the first time, it waits for the `fetch()` coroutine to complete.
- The `fetch()` coroutine simulates a network call by sleeping for 1 second and then returns the value `""Value for data""`.
- This value is stored in the cache dictionary of the `AsyncCache` instance.
- When `await cache.get(""data"")` is called a second time, it checks the cache and finds that the key `""data""` already has a value (`""Value for data""`), so it returns this value immediately without calling `fetch()` again.

Thus, both results are `""Value for data""`.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

What is the output when `MyClass` instance is created?

A) Original method called  
B) Decorator init called  
C) Both A and B  
D) Neither A nor B";"C) Both A and B  

Explanation:
When an instance of `MyClass` is created, Python first invokes the metaclass's `__new__` method. Since `Meta` is specified as the metaclass for `MyClass`, its `__new__` method is called. Inside this method, it calls the original `__new__` method and then assigns a new attribute `original_method` to the class dictionary.

Next, because `class_decorator` is applied to `MyClass`, Python uses it to modify the class before the instance creation process completes. The decorator replaces the `__init__` method of `MyClass`. When an instance is created, Python first calls this modified `__init__` method which prints ""Decorator init called"" and then proceeds to call the original `__init__` method.

Thus, both messages are printed when an instance of `MyClass` is created."

**Part 2 (Answer):**
A) The `timing_decorator` works as intended, providing accurate timing for both synchronous and asynchronous function calls.

Explanation: 
The provided decorator correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions. For synchronous functions, it uses `time.time()` which is accurate for measuring elapsed time in a blocking manner. For asynchronous functions, using `asyncio.sleep` inside the wrapper will not block the event loop; instead, it will allow other tasks to run during the sleep period, making the decorator more efficient than necessary for timing async functions.

**Question:** 
How would you modify the above code to work correctly within an asyncio event loop? Specifically, how can you adapt the `log_access` decorator to handle asynchronous methods and ensure that the logging occurs before the actual method execution?

**Options:**
A) Modify `log_access` to use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`

C) Implement the decorator inside an async function
D) None of the above

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Modify `log_access` to use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`

Explanation: The key to making this work within an asyncio context is to adapt the decorator to handle asynchronous functions. This involves defining the `wrapper` function as `async`, which allows it to use the `await` keyword when calling the original method (`func`). Here's how you can do it:

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_access(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):

Explanation:
The `asyncio.sleep(1)` call in the `work` method of the `AsyncWorker` class simulates a blocking I/O operation. When this coroutine is called within an asyncio event loop, it does not block the execution of other coroutines. Instead, it allows other tasks to run while waiting for the sleep to complete.

D. The output order of the results in `main()` is guaranteed to be in the same order as the input URLs.";"B. The `fetch_data` function returns a coroutine object.

Explanation: In Python, when you define an asynchronous function using the `async def` syntax, it does not immediately execute but instead returns a coroutine object that represents the execution of the function.

You are developing a web application that requires efficient handling of database connections. You decide to implement a connection pool that uses context managers to manage the lifecycle of each connection. The goal is to ensure that all connections are properly closed after use, even if an error occurs during their execution.

Implement a `ConnectionPool` class using a context manager. The class should allow for the creation and management of multiple database connections. When entering the context manager, it should return a connection from the pool, and when exiting, it should ensure that the connection is returned to the pool or closed if an error occurs.

Here's a partial implementation:
```python
class ConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self, max_connections):
        self.max_connections = max_connections
        self.pool = []

    def get_connection(self):
        # Implement this method to return a connection from the pool
        pass

    def release_connection(self, conn):
        # Implement this method to release a connection back to the pool
        pass

    def __enter__(self):
        if len(self.pool) == 0:
            raise ValueError(""No available connections in the pool"")
        return self.get_connection()

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        # Implement this method to handle the exit of the context manager
        pass

# Example usage:
pool = ConnectionPool(5)
with pool as conn:
    result = conn.execute(""SELECT * FROM users"")
```

Which of the following options correctly completes the `ConnectionPool` class?

A) 
```python
def get_connection(self):
    return self.pool.pop()

def release_connection(self, conn):
    self.pool.append(conn)

def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    if exc_type is not None:
        raise exc_value
```

B) 
```python
def get_connection(self):
    return self.pool.pop() if self.pool else self.create_new_connection()

def release_connection(self, conn):
    self.pool.append(conn)

def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    if exc_type is None:
        self.release_connection()
```

C) 
```python
def get_connection(self):
    return self.pool.pop()

def release_connection(self, conn):
    self.pool.append(conn)

def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    if exc_type is not None:
        self.release_connection()
    else:
        raise exc_value
```

D) 
```python

    return self.pool.pop() if self.pool else None

def release_connection(self, conn):
    self.pool.append(conn)

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass and a class decorator to modify behavior at both the class level and instance level. Your task is to predict the output of the `main` function when it is executed.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

def my_decorator(cls):
    class Wrapper(ABC):
        def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
            instance = super().__new__(cls)
            # Decorator modifies instance attributes here
            instance.modified_attr = ""Decorator Modified""
            return instance
    return type(cls.__name__, (Wrapper, cls), {})

class MyClass(metaclass=my_decorator):
    @abstractmethod
    def abstract_method(self):
        pass

def main():
    obj = MyClass()
    print(obj.modified_attr)  # Output from decorator
    obj.abstract_method()     # Abstract method call

# Uncomment the following line to test
# main()
```

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**";"A**

**Explanation:** 

The `my_decorator` function is designed as a class decorator that takes a class `cls`, and returns a new class `Wrapper`. The `Wrapper` class inherits from both `ABC` (making it an abstract base class) and the original class passed to the decorator (`cls`). This setup ensures that any subclass of `MyClass` will be an instance of `Wrapper`, which means any object created from `MyClass` will have additional behavior defined in the `Wrapper` class.

In this case, the `__new__` method of `Wrapper` is overridden to modify the attributes of the instances it creates. It sets `instance.modified_attr = ""Decorator Modified""`. This modification happens every time an instance of `MyClass` (or any subclass) is created, which is what happens in the `main` function when calling `obj = MyClass()`.

However, there are a few issues with this code:
1. The decorator does not properly implement abstract methods from the base class (`ABC`). This will result in an error if an attempt is made to instantiate `MyClass` directly (which is not possible due to the decorator).
2. The `main` function calls an abstract method, which will raise a `TypeError` since no concrete implementation of the abstract method exists.

Despite these issues, the primary question focuses on understanding how metaclasses and decorators can be used together to modify class behavior. Since the decorator does indeed add the attribute `modified_attr` to instances of `MyClass`, option A is the closest correct answer based on the given code structure, even though the overall functionality will fail due to abstract method issues.

If the abstract method was properly implemented in a subclass or directly in `MyClass`, the output would be:

B) The text ""Creating class MyClass"" followed by `True`  
C) The text ""Creating class Meta"" followed by `True`  
D) `False`";"**Answer: B) The text ""Creating class MyClass"" followed by `True`**

Explanation:
In the provided code, `Meta` is a metaclass that overrides the `__new__` method. When `MyClass` is defined, Python's type system automatically calls this method with the necessary arguments. Inside the `__new__` method of the metaclass, it prints the message ""Creating class {name}"", where `{name}` is the name of the class being created (`'MyClass'`). Additionally, it adds a new attribute `created` to the class dictionary and sets its value to `True`. After defining `MyClass`, we print the value of `MyClass.created`, which will be `True`.

Option A is incorrect because metaclasses can indeed be used with regular classes. Option C is wrong because the `__new__` method is called on the metaclass itself, not on the class being created. Option D is incorrect as the value of `MyClass.created` is set to `True`, not `False`."

D) The `AsyncDecorator` class is used incorrectly, and the code will result in a `TypeError`.";"### Part 2 (Answer):

B) The `fetch_data` function is decorated with a class-based decorator `AsyncDecorator`, which converts it into an async function. When called within `main`, it uses the event loop to perform the task asynchronously.

**Explanation:**
- The `AsyncDecorator` class is a decorator that wraps any callable, converting it into an asynchronous function using an inner `wrapper` coroutine.
- The `fetch_data` function is defined as an `async def`, but since it's decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`, the actual execution of `fetch_data` inside `main` will be handled asynchronously by the event loop.
- When `await fetch_data()` is called in `main`, it schedules `fetch_data` to run asynchronously. The event loop runs this coroutine, waits for 1 second as simulated by `asyncio.sleep(1)`, and then returns ""Data fetched"".

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B. When you create an instance of `User`, accessing `user.username` will print ""Accessing username"" and then return the value of `username`.

Explanation:
The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` dynamically wraps each property in a class with getter and setter methods that call `log_access`. This method logs access to attributes. In the given example, when you create an instance of `User` and try to access the `username` attribute, it will first log ""Accessing username"" and then return the value of the actual `username` attribute (which is stored in a private variable `_username`).";"Answer format error.

You are tasked with creating a Python library that manages database connections. The library should support both synchronous and asynchronous operations and be able to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently. 

To achieve this, you decide to use metaclasses and async/await to create a flexible and performant solution.

1. Implement a metaclass `ConnectionMeta` that ensures each connection is unique within the application.
2. Create an asynchronous context manager `AsyncConnectionManager` that manages asynchronous database connections using a pool of connections.
3. Provide a synchronous context manager `SyncConnectionManager` for managing synchronous connections in a thread-safe manner.

Here's a basic structure to get you started:

```python
import asyncio
from collections import deque
import threading

# Define the ConnectionMeta metaclass here
class ConnectionMeta(type):
    pass

# Implement the AsyncConnectionManager class here
class AsyncConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self, pool_size: int):
        self.pool = deque(maxlen=pool_size)
        # Initialize your connection pool here
    
    async def acquire(self):
        if not self.pool:
            raise ConnectionError(""No available connections"")
        return await asyncio.get_running_loop().run_in_executor(None, self._acquire_sync)
    
    def release(self, connection):
        self.pool.append(connection)

    def _acquire_sync(self):
        # Synchronous logic to acquire a connection
        pass

# Implement the SyncConnectionManager class here
class SyncConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self, pool_size: int):
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        self.pool = deque(maxlen=pool_size)
    
    def acquire(self):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.pool:
                raise ConnectionError(""No available connections"")
            return self._acquire_sync()
    
    def release(self, connection):
        with self.lock:
            self.pool.append(connection)

    def _acquire_sync(self):
        # Synchronous logic to acquire a connection
        pass
```

Which of the following statements correctly implements the required functionality?

A) The `ConnectionMeta` metaclass does not need any implementation as it is just a placeholder.
B) The `AsyncConnectionManager` and `SyncConnectionManager` classes should both have their `_acquire_sync` methods implemented to handle connection acquisition in a thread-safe manner for synchronous connections.
C) The `AsyncConnectionManager` should use a lock to ensure thread safety when acquiring connections, as it is managing asynchronous connections.
D) The `SyncConnectionManager` should use an asyncio loop to run synchronous logic in the background.";"[ANSWER]
B) The `AsyncConnectionManager` and `SyncConnectionManager` classes should both have their `_acquire_sync` methods implemented to handle connection acquisition in a thread-safe manner for synchronous connections.

Explanation:
- The `ConnectionMeta` metaclass is essential for ensuring that each connection is unique, which can be achieved using a combination of class attributes and object initialization within the metaclass.
- For the `AsyncConnectionManager`, it should manage asynchronous connections without blocking the event loop, so it doesn't need to use locks. Instead, it can use thread-safe data structures provided by asyncio or standard library functions that are compatible with async operations.
- The `SyncConnectionManager` requires a lock in its `_acquire_sync` method to ensure that multiple threads do not interfere when accessing the connection pool simultaneously.
- Therefore, option B is the correct implementation as it correctly identifies that both classes need their synchronous logic methods implemented for thread safety and proper management of connections."

Consider the following Python code snippet which uses a metaclass to dynamically add attributes to a class at runtime:

```python
# Define a metaclass that adds an attribute 'dynamic_attr'
class DynamicMeta(type):

# Create an instance of MyClass
my_instance = MyClass()

# Access the dynamically added attribute
print(my_instance.dynamic_attr)

What is the output when running this code?

A) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'dynamic_attr'

B) I am dynamic!

C) TypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a class cannot be changed after its creation

D) SyntaxError: invalid syntax";"[B] The output is ""I am dynamic!"" because the `DynamicMeta` metaclass adds the `dynamic_attr` attribute to any class that uses it as their metaclass. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, this new attribute is accessible through the instance's dictionary.

Imagine you're developing a framework for building web applications. You want to create a decorator that automatically logs the arguments with which a function is called, but only if the environment variable `DEBUG` is set to `True`. However, you also need this logging functionality to be optional and not affect the performance of the application when debugging is disabled.

Your task is to implement this feature using decorators. You should ensure that the decorator checks for the existence of the `DEBUG` environment variable before logging. If it's not present or is set to any value other than `True`, the function should execute without logging.

Here's a starting point:

```python
import os

def log_arguments(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Check if DEBUG environment variable is True
        if os.getenv('DEBUG') == 'True':
            print(f""Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@log_arguments
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Now, you're tasked with ensuring that this decorator is only applied to functions when `DEBUG` is set to `True`. You should not modify the `log_arguments` function itself but rather provide a way to conditionally apply it.

What is the correct approach to achieve this?

A) Remove the `@log_arguments` decorator from the `add` function and use a conditional statement inside the function to check for the `DEBUG` environment variable.

B) Define another decorator that checks for the `DEBUG` environment variable before applying the `log_arguments` decorator.

C) Modify the `log_arguments` decorator to include logic for checking the `DEBUG` environment variable internally.

D) Use a metaclass to conditionally apply the `log_arguments` decorator based on the presence of the `DEBUG` environment variable.";"[ANSWER]
B) Define another decorator that checks for the `DEBUG` environment variable before applying the `log_arguments` decorator.

Explanation: The correct approach is to create a new decorator that checks if the `DEBUG` environment variable is set to `True`. If it is, this decorator should then apply the `log_arguments` decorator; otherwise, it should simply return the original function. This allows you to conditionally enable or disable logging without modifying the existing functions.

Here's an example of how you could implement this:

```python
import os

def log_arguments(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f""Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

def conditional_log(debug_decorator):
    def decorator(func):
        if os.getenv('DEBUG') == 'True':
            return debug_decorator(func)
        else:
            return func
    return decorator

@conditional_log(log_arguments)
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# If DEBUG is set to True, this will print the arguments and result.
# If not, it will simply return the result without logging.
result = add(3, 5)
```

This approach allows you to maintain clean code while conditionally enabling or disabling logging based on the `DEBUG` environment variable."

Imagine you are developing a web application that needs to handle a large number of simultaneous connections. To optimize performance, you decide to implement an asynchronous I/O framework using Python's `asyncio` library. You want to ensure that each connection is handled by a separate coroutine and that the application can scale efficiently.

Which of the following approaches would be most suitable for handling multiple concurrent connections in your web application?

A) Use traditional synchronous blocking I/O methods.
B) Implement a custom event loop using `asyncio.create_event_loop()`.
C) Create a single asynchronous coroutine to handle all connections.
D) Use threading or multiprocessing to manage separate threads or processes for each connection.";"A) Use traditional synchronous blocking I/O methods.  
This option is not suitable because it would block the entire application when handling any single connection, leading to a lack of scalability.

B) Implement a custom event loop using `asyncio.create_event_loop()`.  
While this could theoretically work, it is unnecessary and redundant since Python's standard library provides a robust event loop implementation with `asyncio`.

C) Create a single asynchronous coroutine to handle all connections.  
This approach would not scale well because a single coroutine can only process one connection at a time, which defeats the purpose of using asynchronous I/O.

D) Use threading or multiprocessing to manage separate threads or processes for each connection.  
This is the most suitable option because it allows multiple coroutines (or threads/processes) to run concurrently, handling different connections at the same time. Each coroutine can use `asyncio`'s mechanisms to perform non-blocking I/O operations efficiently.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Use threading or multiprocessing to manage separate threads or processes for each connection."

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify the behavior of classes. The goal is to automatically add a `created_at` attribute to any class it decorates with a timestamp when an instance of the class is created.

```python
import time

class TimestampMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'created_at' not in dct:
            dct['created_at'] = time.time()
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=TimestampMeta):
    pass
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior of `MyClass` after it has been decorated with the `TimestampMeta` metaclass?

A) Each instance of `MyClass` will have a unique `created_at` timestamp.

B) All instances of `MyClass` will share the same `created_at` timestamp.

C) The `created_at` attribute will not be added to instances of `MyClass`.

D) Attempting to create an instance of `MyClass` will raise an error.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Each instance of `MyClass` will have a unique `created_at` timestamp.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `TimestampMeta` adds a `created_at` attribute to any class it decorates. This is done in the `__new__` method where it checks if 'created_at' is not already in the dictionary `dct`. If not, it adds the current time as a timestamp.
- Each time an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `__new__` method of its metaclass will be invoked. This means that each instance will get its own unique `created_at` timestamp at the moment of creation.
- Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:
  - Option B suggests all instances share a single timestamp, which is not what happens due to the use of `time.time()` inside `__new__`.
  - Option C is incorrect as the `created_at` attribute is successfully added to each instance.
  - Option D incorrectly implies that creating an instance will raise an error, which does not occur with this implementation."

B) The `my_coroutine` function will execute immediately after its definition.
C) When creating an instance of `MyClass`, the string ""Creating instance of MyClass"" will be printed before the instance is returned.
D) The `my_coroutine` coroutine will not be awaited in the `main` function.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**C) When creating an instance of `MyClass`, the string ""Creating instance of MyClass"" will be printed before the instance is returned.**

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` dynamically defines a new `__call__` method for any class that uses it as its metaclass.
- This new `__call__` method is responsible for printing the creation message when an instance is created.
- In the given code, since `MyClass` uses `Meta` as its metaclass, calling `MyClass()` will invoke this dynamically defined `__call__` method, printing ""Creating instance of MyClass"" before the actual instantiation occurs."
"2025-10-08 08:02";"";"**Question:**

You are tasked with creating a decorator that measures the execution time of any function it decorates. The decorator should also handle asynchronous functions (using `async/await`). Below is an initial attempt at writing such a decorator, but it does not work as expected for both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time() if not asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func) else 0
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds to execute"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
async def async_sleep():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

def sync_function():
    time.sleep(1)
```

Identify what is wrong with the current implementation of `timing_decorator` and provide a corrected version that handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly.

A) The decorator does not use `await` inside the wrapper for asynchronous functions, so it incorrectly reports zero execution time for async functions.  
B) The decorator fails to handle non-async functions properly, as it tries to call `asyncio.sleep()` even if the function is synchronous.  
C) Both A and B are correct.  
D) The implementation is correct and does not need any changes.

**Answer:**

C) Both A and B are correct.

The current implementation of `timing_decorator` has two main issues:
1. For asynchronous functions, it incorrectly reports zero execution time because the synchronous timing logic (`time.time()`) is used instead of waiting for the coroutine to complete with `await`.
2. For synchronous functions, it attempts to call `asyncio.sleep()` which raises an error since `sleep` is not a valid coroutine function.

Here’s how you can correct the decorator:

```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time() if not asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func) else 0
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds to execute"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
async def async_sleep():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

def sync_function():
    time.sleep(1)

# Test with the corrected decorator
asyncio.run(async_sleep())  # Should print ""async_sleep took X.XX seconds""
sync_function()  # Should print ""sync_function took Y.YY seconds""
```

In this corrected version, `time.time()` is used for synchronous functions to get accurate execution time. For asynchronous functions, the decorator waits for the coroutine to complete with `await`, ensuring that the actual execution time of the coroutine is measured correctly."

**Explanation:**

The code defines a metaclass `MyMeta` that checks if the class it's creating has a method named `my_method`. If this method is not present, the metaclass raises a `TypeError`.

In the case of `MySubClass`, it inherits from `MyClass` but intentionally does not define its own `my_method`. This causes the metaclass to fail during the creation of `MySubClass` because it doesn't find the required `my_method` in either `MySubClass` or any of its base classes. As a result, a `TypeError` is raised with the message ""Class does not define my_method""."

```python
import asyncio

D. If multiple threads try to create an instance of `SingletonClass` simultaneously, they will each get their own instance.";"Part 2 (Answer):
A. This statement is correct. The `SingletonMeta` metaclass uses a dictionary `_instances` to store instances of classes using this metaclass.

B. This statement is incorrect. When creating a new instance of `SingletonClass`, if an instance already exists, it will not be re-created with default arguments. Instead, the existing instance is returned.

C. This statement is partially correct but misleading. The `_instances` dictionary stores instances of classes using this metaclass, not all instances. It's more accurate to say that it stores the singleton instances for each class that uses `SingletonMeta`.

D. This statement is incorrect. If multiple threads try to create an instance of `SingletonClass` simultaneously, they will actually share the same instance due to the thread-safe nature of checking and setting `_instances[cls]`.

A) The `run_in_new_task` decorator will create too many tasks, exhausting system resources.
B) The `await task` statement will not properly await the completion of the task, causing it to run in the foreground.
C) Since `asyncio.get_event_loop()` is called within the decorator, it may lead to issues if multiple event loops are created or accessed simultaneously.
D) None of the above.";"[ANSWER] A

Explanation: The `run_in_new_task` decorator does not handle task management properly. When you call `asyncio.get_event_loop().create_task(func(*args, **kwargs))`, it creates a new task but does not wait for it to complete. This means that the function will immediately return without waiting for the task to finish, which can lead to resource exhaustion if many tasks are created concurrently. A better approach would be to use `asyncio.create_task` directly on the coroutine returned by the decorated function and then await it."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print(""Fetching data..."")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return ""Data fetched""

class DataFetcher:
    async def __call__(self):
        return await fetch_data()

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        if instance is None:
            return self
        return types.MethodType(self.__call__, instance)
    
    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print(""Before calling the function"")
        result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(""After calling the function"")
        return result

@AsyncDecorator
async def process_data():
    data = await DataFetcher()()
    return f""Processing {data}""

async def main():
    result = await process_data()
    print(result)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this script when executed?

A) Fetching data... Before calling the function Processing Data fetched After calling the function

B) Before calling the function Fetching data... After calling the function Processing Data fetched

C) Fetching data... Before calling the function After calling the function Processing Data fetched

D) Before calling the function Fetching data... Processing Data fetched After calling the function";"A) Fetching data... Before calling the function Processing Data fetched After calling the function

**Explanation:** 
- `AsyncDecorator` is a descriptor that uses the `__call__` method to intercept calls to the decorated function, printing messages before and after the call.
- The `DataFetcher` class defines an asynchronous method `__call__` that returns data fetched by `fetch_data`.
- When `process_data` is called with `@AsyncDecorator`, it becomes a coroutine that prints ""Before calling the function"", then calls the wrapped `fetch_data` coroutine, which fetches and processes data, finally printing ""After calling the function""."

Consider the following code:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Function {self.func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run."")
        return result

@Timer
def expensive_computation():
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1000000):
        sum += i * i
    return sum

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    expensive_computation()
```

What is the purpose of using a decorator like `@Timer` on the `expensive_computation` function? Explain how this decorator works and what output you would expect when running this script.

A) To add logging to the function  
B) To measure the execution time of the function and print it  
C) To modify the behavior of the function before it is called  
D) To create a new class that inherits from the function";"B) To measure the execution time of the function and print it  

Explanation: The `@Timer` decorator measures the time taken by the `expensive_computation` function to execute. When the decorated function is called, it records the start time, executes the function, records the end time, calculates the duration, prints it, and then returns the result of the function. This allows you to easily see how long the function takes to run without modifying the original code."

Consider the following Python code that uses decorators to create a simple logging system. The goal is to log the entry and exit of functions. However, there are some issues with the current implementation.

```python
import functools

def log_function_calls(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f""Entering {func.__name__}"")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f""Exiting {func.__name__}"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_function_calls
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

@log_function_calls
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

print(add(3, 4))
print(multiply(5, 6))
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the current implementation?

A) The decorator works correctly and logs the entry and exit of both functions.
B) The decorator logs only the entry of the functions and not their exit.
C) There is an error in the decorator that prevents it from logging any information.
D) The decorator logs both the entry and exit of the functions but fails to capture arguments.";"A) The decorator works correctly and logs the entry and exit of both functions.

Explanation:
The provided code snippet uses a simple decorator `log_function_calls` to log the entry and exit of functions. The decorator is applied to two functions, `add` and `multiply`. Each function call inside these decorated functions will indeed log its entry and exit with the correct function name, making this statement true."
"2025-10-12 00:01";"Part 1 (Question):
You are developing a web application that requires a feature to manage user sessions. The requirement is that every session should have a timeout after which it is automatically closed by the system. You decide to use Python decorators for this purpose.

Create a decorator `@session_timeout(timeout)` that can be applied to any function representing an endpoint in your application. When the decorated function is called, it should start a countdown timer based on the provided `timeout` value (in seconds). If the function takes more time than the specified timeout to execute, the session should be closed and an error message returned.

Here's an example of how you might use this decorator:

```python
@session_timeout(10)  # This endpoint has a 10-second timeout
def user_dashboard():
    time.sleep(5)
    return ""User Dashboard""
```

When `user_dashboard()` is called, it should execute within the first 10 seconds. If it takes longer than that, an error message should be returned.

Which of the following is a correct implementation of the `@session_timeout` decorator?

A) Using threading.Timer to check execution time
B) Using asyncio.sleep to enforce the timeout
C) Modifying function arguments to include a timeout parameter
D) None of the above

Part 2 (Answer):
A) Using threading.Timer to check execution time
Explanation: The correct implementation would involve using `threading.Timer` to start a countdown timer when the decorated function is called. If the function does not complete within the specified timeout, the timer should trigger an action to close the session and return an error message. This approach allows for asynchronous handling of timeouts without blocking other parts of the application.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."
