**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that aims to create a decorator for asynchronous functions. The goal is to measure the execution time of an async function. However, the current implementation does not work as expected.

```python
import asyncio

def time_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f""Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def sample_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return ""Done""

# Running the function to test
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(sample_async_function())
```

What is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed?

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
B) The decorator works as expected, but the output format is incorrect.  
C) The decorator should use `async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):` instead of `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`.  
D) The decorator should not measure execution time for asynchronous functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator does not work because `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a coroutine.  
Explanation: The issue with the code lies in how the timing is being recorded. Since `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` returns a function that provides the current time, it should be called directly to get the actual timestamp, not awaited. The correct usage would be `start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` and `end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`. This will give the current event loop's time in seconds when the function starts and ends, allowing the difference to calculate execution time.

Imagine you are developing a web application where users can upload files. You want to ensure that only specific types of files (e.g., .txt, .pdf) can be uploaded. To achieve this, you decide to use decorators and metaclasses in Python.

You create a decorator `@allowed_file_types` that checks if the file type is allowed. Then, you define a metaclass `FileTypeMeta` that automatically applies the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to any class derived from it, setting the allowed types as a parameter.

Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```python
def allowed_file_types(*types):
    def wrapper(cls):
        cls.allowed_types = types
        return cls
    return wrapper

class FileTypeMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'allowed_types' not in dct:
            dct['allowed_types'] = ()
        super_new = super(FileTypeMeta, cls).__new__
        return super_new(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AllowedFiles(metaclass=FileTypeMeta):
    pass

class TextFile(AllowedFiles):
    # TODO: Apply the allowed_file_types decorator here
    pass

# Example usage:
txt_file = TextFile()
print(txt_file.allowed_types)  # Should print ('.txt',)
```

Which of the following ways can you correctly apply the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to the `TextFile` class using the metaclass?

A) Use a direct assignment in the class definition.
B) Override the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute.
C) Use a class variable directly within the class definition.
D) Call the `@allowed_file_types` decorator directly on the class.";"Part 2 (Answer): 
A) Direct assignment is not an option because decorators are applied before the class is fully defined, and direct assignment would occur after the class is created.

B) Correct. By overriding the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute, you can ensure that any subclass of `AllowedFiles` will have its `allowed_types` attribute set by default if not explicitly provided.

C) This would work but doesn't utilize the decorator mechanism and isn't as clean or flexible as using a metaclass.

D) Calling the decorator directly on the class is also not correct because it bypasses the metaclass's influence, which should be used to set the `allowed_types` attribute."

You are developing a Python library that needs to provide thread-safe logging functionality. You want to ensure that log messages from different threads do not interfere with each other, even when they are written simultaneously. Implement a decorator that can be applied to any function to make it thread-safe using locks.

```python
import threading

# Your solution goes here

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    # Decorator code
    pass

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

Choose the correct implementation for the `thread_safe_logger` decorator:

A)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    with lock:
        print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

C)  
```python
def thread_safe_logger(func):
    lock = threading.Lock()
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

D)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            print(f""Log: {message}"")
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```";"B)  
```python
lock = threading.Lock()

def thread_safe_logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe_logger
def log_message(message):
    print(f""Log: {message}"")
```

**Explanation**: The correct implementation is option B. In this solution, the `lock` is defined outside of the decorator function so that it is not recreated with each decorated function call. This ensures that all calls to the decorated functions use the same lock, making the logging thread-safe."

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator to measure the execution time of any function it decorates:

```python
import time

def time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

However, there is a common pitfall with this decorator that can lead to incorrect measurements. What is the issue with this code and how would you fix it?

A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

B) The decorator captures the start time too late, leading to inaccurate timing.

C) The decorator does not allow the function to be called without any arguments.

D) The decorator does not account for recursive calls properly.";"A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.

**Explanation:**
The provided decorator `time_decorator` is synchronous and will measure the total execution time of a synchronous function by capturing the start time before the function call and the end time after the function call. However, it does not account for the case where the function itself might be a coroutine (an asynchronous function). To handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions correctly, you would need to modify the decorator to check if the decorated function is a coroutine using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`. If it is, you should use an asynchronous version of time measurement with `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete`.

A corrected version of the decorator that handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions might look like this:

```python
import asyncio
import time
import inspect

def time_decorator(func):
    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    else:
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f""Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds"")
            return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

This version of the decorator uses conditional logic to determine whether to measure synchronous or asynchronous functions."

Consider the following Python code snippet:

        await asyncio.sleep(0.3)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `Timer` class can be used as a context manager for synchronous tasks.
B) The `Timer` class does not support asynchronous execution and will block when used in an async context.
C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.
D) Only ""Task 1"" will be able to complete successfully due to a bug.";"C) Both ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"" will print their completion time to the console with high precision.

Explanation: The `Timer` class is designed as an asynchronous context manager, which means it can be used in an async block (`async with`). The `__aenter__` method records the start time using `time.time()` and prints a message when entering the block. The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time after exiting the block and prints it. Both tasks, ""Task 1"" and ""Task 2"", will run concurrently due to their usage within an async context manager (`async with`). Therefore, both tasks will measure their execution time accurately and print it to the console."
"2025-04-28 00:01";"### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes dynamically:

```python
class AddMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['add_method'] = lambda self, x: x + 5
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddMethodMeta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.add_method(10))  # Output?
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.

B) The output will be an error because `add_method` is not defined in `MyClass`.

C) The output will be `None` because metaclasses do not affect method definitions.

D) The code will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot add methods dynamically.";"### Part 2 (Answer)

**A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.**

This is the correct answer. In Python, metaclasses allow you to customize class creation by modifying or extending the class definition before it's finalized. In this case, the `AddMethodMeta` metaclass dynamically adds a method named `add_method` to any class it's applied to. When we create an instance of `MyClass`, it gains access to this new method, which simply returns its argument incremented by 5.

The line `print(obj.add_method(10))` will therefore output `15`."

Which of the following statements is true about this code? Select all correct answers:

A) The metaclass `Meta` checks if the subclass has a `greet` method before allowing it to be instantiated.
B) The `greeting_decorator` modifies the `greet` method of any class it decorates, adding a greeting message at the beginning.
C) When `person.greet()` is called, it will first print ""Hello from Person"" and then ""I am a person"".
D) Both A and B are correct.";"[ANSWER] D

Explanation:
A) The metaclass `Meta` correctly checks if the subclass has a `greet` method. If not, it raises a `TypeError`, which is true.
B) The `greeting_decorator` correctly modifies the `greet` method by adding a greeting message at the beginning, which is also true.

What is the expected output of this code? Why does it behave that way?

A) The output will be 1000 because all increments are performed atomically.

B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

C) The output will be more than 1000 due to extra increments caused by thread switching.

D) The program will raise an exception due to improper use of the lock.";"B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

Explanation:
- The decorator `@thread_safe` is intended to ensure that the `increment` method of `SharedResource` is thread-safe by using a lock.
- However, the lock object is created inside the wrapper function for each call. This means that each `increment` call will use its own separate lock instead of sharing the same one across threads.
- Since each thread uses its own lock and does not block other threads from reading and writing to `value`, race conditions can still occur.
- Therefore, the final value of `resource.value` will be less than 1000, as multiple increments might be incorrectly applied."

You are tasked with creating a Python application that needs to track the creation of all instances of a certain class. You decide to use a metaclass for this purpose. Here is a partially complete code snippet:

```python

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(InstanceTracker._instances)  # Expected output: {'MyClass': [obj1, obj2]}

Which line of code should be added to the `__new__` method in the `InstanceTracker` metaclass to track the creation of instances?

A) `cls._instances[name].append(instance)`
B) `self._instances[name] = []`
C) `self._instances[name].append(self())`
D) `self._instances[name].append(new_class())`";"[ANSWER] C

Explanation:
In the provided code, we need to track the creation of instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass. The current implementation does not add any logic to track instances. 

Option A is incorrect because `instance` is not defined in the scope where this line would be executed.
Option B is incorrect because it attempts to create a new list for each class but does not append any instances to it.
Option C is correct because it appends an instance of the newly created class to a list associated with the class name. The `self()` call inside `append` creates a new instance of the class, which is then added to the list stored in `_instances`.
Option D is incorrect because it tries to append the metaclass itself rather than an instance of the class.

Adding this line to the `__new__` method will correctly track and store instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass."

B) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. After that, the program will print nothing as the timer is not running any more tasks.

C) The coroutine starts and stays alive indefinitely because the timer keeps scheduling itself to run every 3 seconds.

D) There will be an error because adding a task to the `AsyncTimer` instance does not start it immediately.";"A) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. The timer runs in an infinite loop every 3 seconds, but since there's only one task, it doesn't add any complexity.

The `run` method of the `AsyncTimer` class is designed to run indefinitely, continuously waiting for all tasks to complete before sleeping for the specified interval. Since the `my_coroutine` is added with a sleep duration of 2 seconds, it will complete after 2 seconds and then wait again for the next iteration of the timer loop (every 3 seconds).

The correct answer is D. The metaclass `Meta` dynamically adds a new attribute to each integer attribute in the class, but it only affects attributes named with a single letter ('x', 'z'). This is because when the `Meta` metaclass iterates over all attributes, it includes inherited attributes as well. In this case, since 'y' is not an integer, no additional attribute is added for it. The '__new__' method of the metaclass is included in the class dictionary because metaclasses define their own `__new__` method to create and return a new class object."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) When `MyClass` is defined, it does not raise any errors.
B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.
C) The metaclass `Meta` can be used to enforce that all classes inheriting from `MyClass` must also define an attribute `x`.
D) The metaclass `Meta` cannot be instantiated directly.";"B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because the code does not run without errors. It raises a `TypeError` during class creation.
- Option C is incorrect because metaclasses like `Meta` control the creation of classes, not their inheritance.
- Option D is correct because a metaclass itself is just a class that inherits from `type`, and it can be instantiated as any other class.
- Option B is correct. The metaclass `Meta` checks if the attribute `x` is present in the class dictionary when the class is being created. If it's not, it raises a `TypeError`."

You are tasked with creating a context manager that logs the time taken for each block of code it decorates. However, you want this logging to be performed asynchronously, so that it does not block the main execution flow. Your task is to design such a context manager using Python's `asyncio` library.

Here's a partially implemented version of your context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f""Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds"")

# Example usage:
async def main():
    async with AsyncTimerContextManager() as timer:
        # Simulate some asynchronous work
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print(""Work completed!"")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

However, this code has an issue: it does not correctly handle exceptions that might occur within the `with` block. You need to ensure that any exceptions raised inside the `with` block are propagated and handled by the caller of `async with`.

What change should you make to the `AsyncTimerContextManager` class to correctly propagate exceptions?

A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

B) Wrap the code that calculates and logs the duration in a try-except block.

C) Remove the `return self` statement from the `__aenter__` method.

D) Change the `log_time_taken` method to be an instance method instead of a static method.";"A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

The correct answer is A. In the `__aexit__` method, you should add a condition to check if an exception occurred (`if exc_type`). If an exception did occur, you should re-raise it using `raise exc_val from exc_tb`. This ensures that any exceptions raised within the `with` block are propagated and handled correctly by the caller of `async with`.

Here's the corrected version of the context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        if exc_type is None:
            await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)
        else:
            raise exc_val from exc_tb

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f""Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds"")

# Example usage remains the same
```

This implementation ensures that exceptions are correctly propagated, allowing for proper error handling in the code using the context manager."

A) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", followed by ""Task 2 started"", then ""Task 1 finished"", and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

B) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 1 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

C) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", followed by ""Task 2 started"", and both tasks will finish concurrently without waiting for the other.

D) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 2 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, but ""Task 1 finished"" will not print because it takes longer to complete.";"B) The output will be ""Task 1 started"", then ""Task 2 started"", followed by ""Task 1 finished"" after a delay of 1 second, and finally ""Task 2 finished"".

Explanation: 
- The `asyncio.gather` function runs multiple coroutines concurrently.
- When both tasks start, they print their start messages immediately.
- However, since `task2` completes first (after 1 second), its completion is printed next.
- After a total of 2 seconds, the completion of `task1` is printed."

A) True  
B) False  
C) The code will raise an error  
D) None of the above";"**Answer:** A) True

**Explanation:**  
The provided metaclass, `SingletonMeta`, ensures that only one instance of any class using it can be created. In this case, when `db1` and `db2` are instantiated from the `Database` class, the `__call__` method of the metaclass is invoked. Since `_instances[cls]` is checked for `SingletonMeta`, and since no other instance exists in `_instances`, both `db1` and `db2` will reference the same instance stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`."

Which of the following statements is true about the `counter` decorator and the `my_function` when it's decorated?

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

B) The `wrapper` function does not have access to the `count` attribute because it is a local variable in the `counter` function.

C) Each call to `my_function` creates a new instance of the `counter` decorator.

D) When `my_function` is decorated, the `func.count` attribute is set to 1 immediately and then incremented by 1 each time the function is called.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

Explanation:
- A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it. In this case, the `counter` decorator is designed to keep track of how many times the decorated function (`my_function`) has been called.
- The `wrapper` function inside the `counter` decorator has access to all non-local variables, including those defined in enclosing functions. Therefore, it can modify the `count` attribute which was set on the original function object when it was passed to the decorator.
- Each call to `my_function()` increments the `count` by 1, demonstrating that the `func.count` attribute is indeed being updated correctly with each invocation.";"Answer format error. Please check the generated content."

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

B) The use of `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` inside the wrapper function is incorrect and will raise an error.

C) The `@time_decorator` syntax applies the decorator to any synchronous or asynchronous function without modification.

D) The execution time measurement is accurate but can be improved by using a more precise timer.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

Explanation: The code uses `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` to get the current time asynchronously, which is appropriate for measuring the execution time of an asyncio function. This method ensures that the timing does not interfere with other tasks running in the event loop. The decorator works as intended and provides accurate execution time measurements for asynchronous functions."

What is the output when running this code?

A) The file 'example.txt' will be created with ""Hello, World!"" inside.
B) ""Executing open_file"" will be printed before the file is written to.
C) An error will occur because decorators cannot be used with context managers.
D) ""Executing open_file"" will not be printed.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The file 'example.txt' will be created with ""Hello, World!"" inside.

Explanation: Decorators and context managers are separate concepts in Python. While you can use a decorator on any callable, including a function used within a context manager, the decorators themselves do not interfere with the behavior of the context manager. In this example, `log_decorator` is applied to `open_file`, but since it does not modify the behavior of opening or closing the file (only logs that the function is being executed), the file operations will still occur as expected.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) The `my_decorator` will only execute before the `say_hello()` function, not when accessing the `my_property`.

Explanation:
In Python, decorators can be applied to methods in classes. However, when a property is accessed, it does not pass through the decorator because properties have their own getter, setter, and deleter methods associated with them. In this case, the `@property` decorator applies the `my_decorator` only to the getter method of `my_property`. Therefore, the message ""Something is happening before the function is called."" will be printed when accessing `obj.my_property`, but ""Something is happening after the function is called."" will not be printed because the decorator does not apply to the setter or deleter methods."

B) The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator wraps `my_async_function` in a way that it can be used with `asyncio.run()`.

**Explanation:**
The `@AsyncDecorator` class is designed to accept an asynchronous function (`my_async_function`) and simply call it. This does not change the fact that `my_async_function` is still an async function, meaning it requires proper execution through an event loop like `asyncio.run()`. Thus, using `@AsyncDecorator` does not alter the fundamental nature of `my_async_function`; it remains a coroutine, which can only be executed in an asyncio context. Therefore, calling `my_async_function()` directly outside of an async context or without wrapping it in an appropriate event loop will raise an error unless `my_async_function` is defined as a regular function rather than an async one."

You are tasked with optimizing a Python script that involves frequent I/O operations. The current implementation uses synchronous file handling, which is blocking and affects the performance of the application.

To optimize this, you decide to use asynchronous file handling with `asyncio`. However, your script also needs to maintain state across multiple asynchronous tasks without using global variables or mutable shared data structures.

Which of the following approaches would be most suitable for maintaining state between asynchronous tasks while optimizing I/O operations?

A) Using a class-based state management system that inherits from `asyncio.Lock` and handles all state transitions asynchronously

B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup

C) Implementing a custom metaclass that tracks state across asynchronous tasks by intercepting attribute access and modification

D) Creating a global dictionary to store state information, which is thread-safe due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup**

This approach is the most suitable for several reasons:
1. **State Management**: `AsyncExitStack` allows you to manage multiple asynchronous context managers efficiently, ensuring that resources are cleaned up properly even if an exception occurs.
2. **Concurrency Safety**: By using `asyncio.Queue`, you can safely share state across tasks without worrying about race conditions or synchronization issues, making the system more robust and scalable.
3. **Asynchronous Operations**: Since both `AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` are asynchronous constructs, they integrate seamlessly with other asynchronous components of your application, improving overall performance and responsiveness.

The other options have limitations:
- **Option A** uses `asyncio.Lock`, which is more for synchronization rather than state management.
- **Option C**, while it might be interesting, introduces unnecessary complexity and potential issues related to maintaining state in a metaclass, especially since metaclasses are not directly designed for this purpose.
- **Option D** relies on the GIL, which would limit performance gains from asynchronous programming, as it doesn't take advantage of multiple cores or threads effectively."

Which of the following is the correct diagnosis for why `MyClass` instances do not log method calls as expected?

A) The metaclass's `__new__` method is incorrectly overriding the class dictionary.

B) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.

C) Using `setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))` modifies the class dictionary in an unintended way.

D) The `wrapper` function inside `log_method` is incorrectly capturing its arguments.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The staticmethod `log_method` does not properly capture the original method's scope.

The issue with the provided code is that the `log_method` static method is intended to return a new callable that logs when the wrapped method is called. However, it incorrectly modifies the `wrapper` function's closure by using `*args, **kwargs`, which prevents it from capturing the correct arguments and keyword arguments of the original method.

To fix this, one should avoid modifying the `wrapper` function in-place within `log_method`. A better approach would be to define a new callable object that captures the original method and its signature correctly. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f""Creating class {name}"")
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():

                setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_method(attr_value))

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

A) The `__len__` method will return 0 because it does not count attributes.

B) The `__len__` method will raise an error because it cannot determine attribute counts dynamically.

C) The `__len__` method will return 2 because it correctly counts the instance attributes.

D) The behavior of the `MyClass` instances will be unchanged as no additional methods were added.

### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct answer: C) The `__len__` method will return 2 because it correctly counts the instance attributes.**

**Explanation:** The metaclass `AutoLenMeta` dynamically adds a `__len__` method to any class it decorates. This method returns the number of items in the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which typically includes all non-private attributes of the class (i.e., those not starting with an underscore). Therefore, when `MyClass` is created, the `__len__` method will return 2, as there are two attributes (`a` and `b`) in the `MyClass`. The lambda function used for `__len__` counts all items directly from the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which correctly reflects the number of instance attributes.";"Answer format error.

B) Method '__init__' called with args: (), kwargs: {}  
   38

C) Method '__init__' called with args: (10, 20), kwargs: {}  
   Method 'add' called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}

D) Error: __new__() got multiple values for argument 'name'

**Part 2 (Answer):**
C) Method '__init__' called with args: (10, 20), kwargs: {}  
   Method 'add' called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}  
   40

**Explanation:** 
When `MyClass` is instantiated, the metaclass `LogMethodCalls` logs the call to the `__init__` method before executing it. After `__init__` is called, when `obj.add(5, 3)` is executed, the `add` method is also logged by the `LogMethodCalls` metaclass. The expected output includes both the log statements and the result of the `add` method call, which is 40."

What will be the output of `instance1 == instance2` and `instance1.value` when the code is executed?

A. True, 10  
B. False, 10  
C. True, 20  
D. False, 20";"A. True, 10  

Explanation: The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created, no matter how many times it is instantiated. When `instance1 = create_instance(10)` is executed, an instance with `value=10` is created and stored in `_instances`. Then, when `instance2 = create_instance(20)` is called, the existing instance from `_instances` (which has `value=10`) is returned. Therefore, `instance1 == instance2` evaluates to True because they refer to the same object. Additionally, since both instances are the same, `instance1.value` also returns 10."

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to modify the behavior of a class method:

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_method_calls(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):

# Create an instance of MyClass and call its method
obj = MyClass(10)

What will be the output of this code when executed? Explain how decorators work in this context.

A) ""Calling get_value with args=(), kwargs={}

""10""

C) TypeError: get_value() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'

D) None";"A) ""Calling get_value with args=(), kwargs={}

Explanation: In this example, a decorator named `log_method_calls` is defined to log the calls to methods it decorates. The `wrapper` function inside the decorator logs the method name and its arguments before calling the original method. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and the `get_value` method is called, the output shows that the method was successfully logged with no arguments passed (as `self` is automatically passed by Python when a method is called on an instance), followed by the return value of the method call."

D) An error will occur because asyncio.sleep is not used correctly.

Part 2 (Answer):
C) The tasks run concurrently, and all three finish within about 3 seconds.

Explanation:
The `asyncio.gather` function is used to run multiple coroutines concurrently. In this example, 'A', 'B', and 'C' start at the same time, and each task has a different sleep duration. Task 'A' sleeps for 1 second, 'B' for 2 seconds, and 'C' for 3 seconds.

Implement a decorator that measures the execution time of a coroutine. The decorator should be able to handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions. Use `asyncio` for asynchronous timing.

Here is a partial implementation to help you get started:

def measure_time(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)

    await asyncio.sleep(1)

sync_function = measure_time(lambda: time.sleep(1))

# Call both the synchronous and asynchronous functions to see their execution times.
sync_function()
asyncio.run(async_function())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the implementation above?

A) The `measure_time` decorator works correctly for both synchronous and asynchronous functions but it fails when applied to synchronous functions.

B) The `measure_time` decorator is fully functional for both types of functions and will accurately measure their execution times.

C) The `wrapper` function in the decorator incorrectly measures time due to a mistake in capturing start and end times.

D) The `async_function` can be called directly without using `await`, but it will not trigger the execution time measurement because of its `@measure_time` decorator.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
B) The `measure_time` decorator is fully functional for both types of functions and will accurately measure their execution times.

The implementation uses `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` to capture the current loop time, which works correctly whether the function being measured is synchronous or asynchronous. For synchronous functions, calling `await asyncio.sleep(1)` in a coroutine context effectively pauses the event loop for 1 second while still allowing other tasks to run, thus accurately measuring the execution time.";"Answer format error.

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior. The goal is to add an `__init_subclass__` method to any subclass, which initializes each attribute with a default value if it's not provided.

A) The decorator is not properly used within the metaclass.
B) Both the metaclass and the decorator are incorrectly trying to manage instances.

D) The use of `@wraps(cls)` in the decorator is unnecessary and causing issues.

Part 2 (Answer):
B) Both the metaclass and the decorator are incorrectly trying to manage instances.

Explanation:
The issue with the provided code lies in its attempt to combine singleton patterns using both a metaclass (`SingletonMeta`) and a decorator (`singleton`). Each of these methods tries to manage the instance creation, leading to conflicts when an instance is created through one method (metaclass) and later attempted again through another (decorator). The correct approach would be to use either the metaclass or the decorator but not both. If using a metaclass, it should handle all instance creation logic within its `__call__` method. If using a decorator, it should manage instances outside of class definitions and apply it to methods that need to return singleton instances rather than applying it directly to the class.";"Answer format error.

A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.

B) The decorator uses a closure to capture and modify the behavior of the original function.

C) The `wrapper` function inside the `timer` decorator directly replaces `compute_sum`.

D) The execution time is printed only once, outside of the function call in `compute_sum`.";"A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.

**Explanation:** 
Option A is correct. In Python, decorators are functions that take another function and extend its behavior without explicitly modifying it. The `wrapper` function captures the execution time by recording the start and end times around the call to the original function `func`. This extended behavior is then returned when `compute_sum` is called.

**Option B:**
While the decorator does use a closure, this is not what makes it modify the original function. A closure only affects how variables are bound within nested functions. The modification happens through the way the `wrapper` function is defined and returned by the `timer` decorator.

**Option C:**
This statement is incorrect because the `wrapper` function does not replace `compute_sum`. Instead, it wraps around `compute_sum` to add the timing functionality.

**Option D:**
The execution time is printed inside the `wrapper` function each time `compute_sum` is called. It is not a one-time print outside of the function call."

Explanation: The correct answer is B. The metaclass `AutoReprMeta` dynamically adds a `__repr__` method to any class it decorates, which in this case is `MyClass`. This method returns a string formatted as ""ClassName(instance_id)"", where `instance_id` is the memory address of the instance, as returned by Python's built-in `id()` function.

D) The decorator will cause a stack overflow due to excessive recursion when used with large inputs.

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]  
**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When applied to `compute_sum`, the decorator will print the execution time without modifying its return value.

Explanation: The provided decorator, `timing_decorator`, is correctly implemented. It measures the time taken by the function it decorates (`func`) and prints this duration. However, it does not modify the return value of the function being decorated. Therefore, when `compute_sum(100000)` is called with the `@timing_decorator` applied, it will print the execution time and then return the result of `sum(range(1))`, which is 5000050000, as expected.

The decorator can be used with coroutine functions without issues. However, in Python, decorators are not directly applicable to coroutines due to differences in how they are executed and awaited, so attempting to use a timing decorator on a coroutine would not raise an error but would likely not function as intended.

**Explanation:**  
The decorator `async_if_docstring_contains_async` checks if the docstring of a function contains the word ""async"". If it does, the function is decorated with `asyncio.coroutine`, which converts it into an asynchronous function. In the given code, the subclass `Derived` inherits from `Base`. Since `method_with_async_in_docstring` has a docstring containing ""async"", it will be converted to an asynchronous method when it is accessed via an instance of `Derived`. On the other hand, `method_without_async_in_docstring`, even though it's defined as an async method in the class definition, does not have the required word ""async"" in its docstring. Therefore, the decorator does not affect it, and it remains a regular asynchronous method when called."
