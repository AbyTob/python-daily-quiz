    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that attempts to implement a context manager using a class with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. However, it contains a subtle error:

```python
class MyContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.resource = open('example.txt', 'w')

    def __enter__(self):
        return self.resource

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        self.resource.close()
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The context manager will successfully close the file when used in a `with` statement.
B) The context manager will fail to close the file because it does not handle exceptions properly.
C) The context manager will always raise an exception because the file open operation might fail.
D) The context manager's constructor raises an exception, which prevents its use as a context manager.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The context manager will fail to close the file because it does not handle exceptions properly.

Explanation: In Python, if `__exit__` returns `True`, it signals that no exception was raised inside the `with` block. If an exception occurs and is not handled within `__exit__`, it propagates up the call stack. The given context manager does not return any value from `__exit__`, which by default means that any exceptions inside the `with` block are considered unhandled, causing the program to crash or continue running with the exception uncaught. To fix this, `__exit__` should explicitly return `False` if it wants to handle all exceptions, or properly handle and suppress exceptions as needed.
