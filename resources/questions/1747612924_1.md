    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator for counting how many times each function in a class is called:

```python
import functools

def call_count(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        wrapper.call_count += 1
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    wrapper.call_count = 0
    return wrapper

class FunctionCounter:
    pass

# Applying the decorator to methods of FunctionCounter
FunctionCounter.method1 = call_count(FunctionCounter.method1)
FunctionCounter.method2 = call_count(FunctionCounter.method2)

fc = FunctionCounter()
fc.method1()
fc.method1()
fc.method2()

print(FunctionCounter.method1.call_count)  # Output: ?
print(FunctionCounter.method2.call_count)  # Output: ?
```

What will be the output of the above code when run? Explain why.

A) 0, 0
B) 1, 1
C) 2, 1
D) 1, 2
    
    ## Answer
    Answer: C) 2, 1

Explanation:
The `call_count` decorator is designed to count how many times a method is called. However, the issue lies in how decorators are applied and shared across class methods. In Python, when you apply a decorator to multiple methods of a class using direct assignment like `FunctionCounter.method1 = call_count(FunctionCounter.method1)`, the decorator's state (in this case, `call_count`) is not preserved or shared between these methods.

In the provided code:
- The first two method calls (`fc.method1()` twice) correctly increment the `call_count` for `method1`.
- The third method call (`fc.method2()`) does not affect `method1`'s count because it was already assigned a different state with its own separate `call_count`.

Thus, `FunctionCounter.method1.call_count` remains 2 (since it was only incremented twice), and `FunctionCounter.method2.call_count` is still 0 (as it was never called).
