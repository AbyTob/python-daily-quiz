**Q: Understanding Metaclasses and Class Decorators in Depth**

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def decorator(cls):
    class WrappedClass(cls):
        def new_method(self):
            print("New method called")
    return WrappedClass

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    @decorator
    class Inner:
        pass

# What will be printed when the following code is executed?
print(MyClass.Inner())
```

**A:**
A) Creating class MyClass
   New method called
   
B) Creating class MyClass.Inner
   New method called
   
C) Creating class MyClass.Inner
   AttributeError
   
D) Creating class MyClass
   AttributeError

[ANSWER]
**A) Creating class MyClass
New method called**

Explanation:
- The `Meta` metaclass is invoked when `MyClass` is created, printing "Creating class MyClass".
- The `decorator` function is applied to the inner class `Inner`. However, the decorator function itself does not modify the behavior of the class directly. Instead, it returns a new class `WrappedClass` that includes an additional method `new_method`.
- When `MyClass.Inner()` is called, Python attempts to instantiate `Inner`, but since `Inner` is wrapped by `decorator`, it tries to call `new_method`. However, this method does not exist in the original class definition due to a misunderstanding. The correct approach would be to ensure that the decorator properly wraps and returns the class, which was not demonstrated correctly in the given code.
- Therefore, the output will include the metaclass creation message but not the expected `new_method` call because of an error in how the decorator is applied.

The provided code snippet does not correctly demonstrate how to apply decorators to classes using metaclasses and thus does not lead to the expected behavior as described.
