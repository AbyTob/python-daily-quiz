    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class DatabaseConnection(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to database...")

# Example usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

Now, imagine you have a class `LoggingMeta` that logs the creation of instances. Modify the existing code to incorporate this new metaclass in a way that it seamlessly integrates with the `SingletonMeta` and respects the singleton pattern.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B.

Explanation: The task requires creating a metaclass that combines the functionality of both `SingletonMeta` and `LoggingMeta`. To achieve this, we need to ensure that the new metaclass inherits from both metaclasses. Here's how you can do it:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, dct)

class DatabaseConnection(metaclass=SingletonMeta | LoggingMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to database...")

# Example usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

In this solution:
- We use Python's type hinting feature with `|` (pipe symbol, which is the bitwise OR operator in Python 3.10+). This syntax allows us to specify that `DatabaseConnection` should have the metaclass behavior of both `SingletonMeta` and `LoggingMeta`.
- The `__new__` method of `LoggingMeta` logs the creation of each class.
- When creating an instance of `DatabaseConnection`, both the singleton pattern and logging are respected.
