    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

class Resource:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        print(f"Resource {name} acquired.")

    def __del__(self):
        print(f"Resource {self.name} released.")

@contextmanager
def manage_resource(name):
    resource = Resource(name)
    try:
        yield resource
    finally:
        del resource

def use_resource():
    with manage_resource("A") as res:
        print(f"Using resource: {res.name}")
    print("Finished using resources.")

use_resource()
```

What is the output of this code, and why?

A) Resource A acquired. Using resource: A Finished using resources.
B) Resource A acquired. Using resource: A Resource A released. Finished using resources.
C) Resource A acquired. Using resource: A Resource A released (in some indeterminate order). Finished using resources.
D) Resource A acquired. Resource A released. Using resource: A Finished using resources.
    
    ## Answer
    B) Resource A acquired. Using resource: A Resource A released. Finished using resources.

Explanation: When the `with` statement is used, it ensures that the context manager (`manage_resource`) properly manages the lifecycle of the resource. The `__enter__` method returns the resource, and the `__exit__` method (which is called automatically when exiting the `with` block) is responsible for cleaning up the resource. In this case, deleting the resource in the `finally` block ensures that the resource is released even if an exception occurs within the block. Therefore, the output will show the resource being acquired, used, and then released before finishing.
