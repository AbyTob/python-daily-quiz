    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to enforce type constraints on class attributes:

```python
class TypeEnforcer(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr, value in dct.items():
            if not isinstance(value, int):
                raise TypeError(f"{attr} must be an integer")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=TypeEnforcer):
    a = 1
    b = 'string'  # This should raise a TypeError on class creation

# Uncomment the following line to test:
# obj = MyClass()
```

What happens when you uncomment the `obj = MyClass()` line?

A) An instance of `MyClass` is created successfully.

B) A `TypeError` is raised because the attribute `b` is not an integer.

C) The program crashes with a segmentation fault.

D) No error is raised, but the value of `b` is ignored and set to `None`.
    
    ## Answer
    [B] A `TypeError` is raised because the attribute `b` is not an integer.

Explanation: When you attempt to create an instance of `MyClass`, the metaclass `TypeEnforcer` checks each attribute in the class dictionary. It finds that the attribute `b` has a value of `'string'`, which is not an integer, and thus raises a `TypeError`. This error occurs during the creation of the class, so no instance can be created successfully.
