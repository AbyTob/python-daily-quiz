    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses decorators and metaclasses to create a class that automatically logs method calls:

```python
class AutoLogMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = cls.log_method(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def log_method(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print(f"{func.__name__} returned: {result}")
            return result
        return wrapper

class MyClass(metaclass=AutoLogMeta):
    def method1(self, x, y):
        return x + y

    def method2(self, a, b, c):
        return a * b * c
```

Given this code, if you create an instance of `MyClass` and call its methods, what will be printed to the console?

A) Nothing will be printed.
B) Only the first method call will be logged.
C) Both method calls will be logged with their arguments and return values.
D) The class instantiation itself will be logged.
    
    ## Answer
    C) Both method calls will be logged with their arguments and return values.

Explanation: When you create an instance of `MyClass`, the metaclass `AutoLogMeta` is invoked to modify the class definition. It searches for callable attributes (methods) in the class dictionary and wraps each one with a logging wrapper function defined by `log_method`. This wrapper prints method calls, arguments, and return values every time a decorated method is called on any instance of `MyClass`. Therefore, when you call both `method1` and `method2` on an instance of `MyClass`, the logs for both methods will be printed as specified in option C.
