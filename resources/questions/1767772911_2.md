    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Pre-execution")
        result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Post-execution")
        return result

@AsyncDecorator
async def my_coroutine():
    print("Coroutine execution")

async def main():
    await my_coroutine()

# Run the event loop to execute the coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the output when you run this code? Explain how decorators interact with asynchronous functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
A) 
```plaintext
Pre-execution
Coroutine execution
Post-execution
```
B) 
```plaintext
Coroutine execution
Pre-execution
Post-execution
```
C) 
```plaintext
Pre-execution
Post-execution
Coroutine execution
```
D) 
```plaintext
Error: Non-async function decorated with async decorator
```

**Explanation:** The correct answer is A. Decorators in Python, when used on asynchronous functions (coroutines), are called before the `await` keyword triggers the execution of the coroutine itself. This means that "Pre-execution" will be printed immediately after the decorator is applied to the coroutine, then "Coroutine execution" will occur as part of the coroutine's task, and finally "Post-execution" will run after the coroutine completes its execution.
