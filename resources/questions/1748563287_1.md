    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following code snippet that uses a decorator to measure execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

print(compute_sum(1000000))
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `timing_decorator` modifies the behavior of the `compute_sum` function by wrapping it with additional functionality.
B) The `wrapper` function is a metaclass used to dynamically change the class at runtime.
C) The `compute_sum` function will execute synchronously even when decorated with `@timing_decorator`.
D) The decorator does not capture any arguments passed to the `compute_sum` function.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `timing_decorator` modifies the behavior of the `compute_sum` function by wrapping it with additional functionality.
