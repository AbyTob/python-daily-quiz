**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, timeout):
        self.timeout = timeout
        self._task = None

    def __enter__(self):
        async def timer():
            await asyncio.sleep(self.timeout)
            print(f"Timer expired after {self.timeout} seconds")
        self._task = asyncio.create_task(timer())
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if self._task:
            self._task.cancel()

async def main():
    with AsyncTimer(3):
        print("Waiting for timer...")
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
        print("Continuing after 2 seconds")

# Run the example
asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be printed to the console when running this code?

A) Waiting for timer...  
   Timer expired after 3 seconds  
   Continuing after 2 seconds  

B) Waiting for timer...  
   Continuing after 2 seconds  

C) Waiting for timer...  
   Timer expired after 2 seconds  

D) None of the above

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Waiting for timer...  
   Timer expired after 3 seconds  
   Continuing after 2 seconds  

Explanation: The `AsyncTimer` class is designed to be used as a context manager, creating an asynchronous task that runs in the background. When entering the context, it starts an asyncio sleep coroutine that will run for the specified timeout and then print a message. However, since the coroutine does not wait for this timer to complete, it immediately prints "Waiting for timer..." and continues execution of `main`. The `AsyncTimer` class itself does not have any influence on when its context manager exits or re-enters; it only manages the lifecycle of the async task created in `__enter__`.

The correct behavior will be:
1. "Waiting for timer..." printed immediately as the context manager enters.
2. The main coroutine continues to run and prints "Continuing after 2 seconds".
3. After 3 seconds, if the task hasn't already been cancelled (which it won't have), it would print "Timer expired after 3 seconds". However, this part is not reached because the context manager does not wait for the timer to expire before exiting.
