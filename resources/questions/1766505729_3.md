    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to track instances of a class:

```python
class TrackInstances(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        cls._instances[id(instance)] = instance
        return instance

class MyClass(metaclass=TrackInstances):
    pass
```

Which of the following statements is true about this implementation?

A) The `__call__` method in `TrackInstances` ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created.

B) All instances of `MyClass` are stored in a dictionary `_instances`, with their IDs as keys.

C) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it is added to the `_instances` dictionary and then returned.

D) The metaclass `TrackInstances` prevents any subclassing of `MyClass`.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] C) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it is added to the `_instances` dictionary and then returned.

Explanation: 
- Option A is incorrect because the code does not ensure that only one instance can be created. Multiple instances can still be created.
- Option B is partially correct but not entirely accurate. The dictionary `_instances` is correctly used to store instances, but using the `id(instance)` as keys might not always be unique or meaningful for all purposes.
- Option C is correct. The `__call__` method of the metaclass `TrackInstances` is called whenever an instance of `MyClass` is created. This method then adds the new instance to the `_instances` dictionary using its ID as a key and returns the instance.
- Option D is incorrect because there are no restrictions on subclassing in this implementation. Subclasses of `MyClass` can be created without any issues.
