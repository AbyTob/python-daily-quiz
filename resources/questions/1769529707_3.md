    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior dynamically. The metaclass `AddHello` is designed to add a method `hello` to any class it decorates, which simply prints "Hello from [ClassName]!".

```python
class AddHello(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Adding a 'hello' method dynamically
        dct['hello'] = lambda self: print(f"Hello from {name}!")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddHello):
    pass

# Usage example
obj = MyClass()
obj.hello()
```

What happens when we create an instance of `MyClass` and call its `hello` method?

A) It will print "Hello from MyClass!"
B) It will raise a TypeError because the class does not have a 'hello' method.
C) It will do nothing and silently fail.
D) The metaclass will not work as expected, and no output will be generated.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) It will print "Hello from MyClass!"

Explanation:
The `AddHello` metaclass successfully adds the `hello` method to any class it decorates. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and its `hello` method is called, it executes as defined in the metaclass, printing "Hello from MyClass!" This demonstrates how metaclasses can dynamically modify class attributes at runtime, enhancing their behavior without altering the original source code.
