    **Part 1 (Question):**

You are tasked with creating a custom context manager that not only manages the opening and closing of files but also adds a timestamp to the beginning of each file when it is opened. The goal is to ensure that every time a file is accessed through this context manager, it automatically prepends a line with the current date and time.

Given the following code skeleton:

```python
import datetime

class TimestampedFile:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode
        self.file = None

    def __enter__(self):
        # Open the file in append mode if it does not exist, otherwise create a new one.
        pass

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        # Close the file and handle any exceptions if necessary.
        pass

# Usage example:
with TimestampedFile('log.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("This is a test log entry.")
```

Complete the implementation of `TimestampedFile` such that it correctly opens the file, prepends a timestamp to each write operation, and ensures proper cleanup.

**Options:**
A) The context manager should append the timestamp to every line written, ensuring consistency across all writes.
B) The context manager should prepend a timestamp at the start of the file and handle file opening/closing within `__enter__` and `__exit__`.
C) The context manager should only log errors and not modify the file's contents.
D) None of the above.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The context manager should prepend a timestamp at the start of the file and handle file opening/closing within `__enter__` and `__exit__`.

Explanation: A correct implementation of this context manager would open the file in append mode (`'a'`) if it does not exist or create a new one. Inside the `__enter__` method, it should check if the file is already at the end of the file to determine whether to write the timestamp. The timestamp should be written before any other content added to the file during the context manager's block. In the `__exit__` method, it should close the file properly. This ensures that every time a file is accessed through this context manager, it automatically prepends a line with the current date and time.
