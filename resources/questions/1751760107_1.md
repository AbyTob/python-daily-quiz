# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question): Consider the following code snippet that uses a decorator to create a class decorator:

```python
def debug_class(cls):
    orig_init = cls.__init__
    
    def new_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Initializing {cls.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        orig_init(self, *args, **kwargs)
    
    cls.__init__ = new_init
    return cls

@debug_class
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b

obj = MyClass(1, 2)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `MyClass` will not be decorated because decorators cannot be applied to classes.
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print: "Initializing MyClass with args: (1, 2), kwargs: {}".
C) The decorator does not modify the class in any way.
D) An AttributeError will occur when trying to create an instance of `MyClass`.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer): B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print: "Initializing MyClass with args: (1, 2), kwargs: {}".

Explanation: The decorator `debug_class` wraps the original `__init__` method of `MyClass`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the modified `__init__` method is called, which first prints debug information and then calls the original `__init__` method. Therefore, when you create an instance with arguments (1, 2), it will output the specified message followed by initializing the class attributes.
