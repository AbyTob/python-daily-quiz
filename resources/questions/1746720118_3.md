    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to measure the execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(1, n+1))

compute_sum(1000000)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this implementation?

A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.

B) The decorator uses a closure to capture and modify the behavior of the original function.

C) The `wrapper` function inside the `timer` decorator directly replaces `compute_sum`.

D) The execution time is printed only once, outside of the function call in `compute_sum`.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The decorator `timer` modifies the original function `compute_sum` to include timing functionality.

**Explanation:** 
Option A is correct. In Python, decorators are functions that take another function and extend its behavior without explicitly modifying it. The `wrapper` function captures the execution time by recording the start and end times around the call to the original function `func`. This extended behavior is then returned when `compute_sum` is called.

**Option B:**
While the decorator does use a closure, this is not what makes it modify the original function. A closure only affects how variables are bound within nested functions. The modification happens through the way the `wrapper` function is defined and returned by the `timer` decorator.

**Option C:**
This statement is incorrect because the `wrapper` function does not replace `compute_sum`. Instead, it wraps around `compute_sum` to add the timing functionality.

**Option D:**
The execution time is printed inside the `wrapper` function each time `compute_sum` is called. It is not a one-time print outside of the function call.
