    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a class `AsyncTimer` that will manage asynchronous operations with timeouts. The class should have methods `start` and `stop`. When the timer is started, it should wait for a specified duration and then call a callback function. If the timer is stopped before expiration, it should cancel the operation.

Below is an incomplete implementation of the `AsyncTimer` class:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, timeout):
        self.timeout = timeout
        self._task = None

    async def start(self, callback):
        # Your implementation here

    def stop(self):
        if self._task and not self._task.done():
            self._task.cancel()
```

Your task is to complete the `start` method so that it creates an asynchronous task that waits for `timeout` seconds and then calls the provided `callback` function. If the timer is stopped before expiration, the operation should be canceled.

What should the implementation of the `start` method look like?

A) 
```python
async def start(self, callback):
    self._task = asyncio.create_task(callback())
```

B)
```python
async def start(self, callback):
    self._task = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.sleep(self.timeout))
    await self._task
    if not self._task.done():
        callback()
```

C)
```python
async def start(self, callback):
    async def wrapper():
        await asyncio.sleep(self.timeout)
        if not self._task.cancelled():
            callback()
    self._task = asyncio.create_task(wrapper())
```

D)
```python
async def start(self, callback):
    self._task = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.sleep(self.timeout))
    try:
        await self._task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
    else:
        if not self._task.cancelled():
            callback()
```
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
D) 
```python
async def start(self, callback):
    self._task = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.sleep(self.timeout))
    try:
        await self._task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
    else:
        if not self._task.cancelled():
            callback()
```

**Explanation:** The correct implementation of the `start` method uses an asynchronous task that waits for the specified timeout and then checks if the task was cancelled. If it wasn't cancelled, it calls the provided callback function. This ensures that the callback is only called when the timer expires and not if it's stopped prematurely.
