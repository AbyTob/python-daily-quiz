# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator to measure the execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the use and functionality of this decorator?

A) The `timer` decorator will correctly measure the execution time of any function it decorates, including `compute_sum`.

B) The `wrapper` function inside `timer` captures all arguments and keyword arguments passed to the decorated function and passes them along.

C) If another decorator is added above `@timer`, such as `@memoize`, it will not affect the execution time measurement by `timer`.

D) The `timer` decorator can be used with asynchronous functions without modification, but the output will not include any meaningful timing information.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) This statement is incorrect because while the decorator itself works to measure execution time, it does not account for I/O operations if they are performed within the function. If `compute_sum` involves expensive I/O operations, their time would not be included in the measurement.

B) Correct. The `wrapper` function correctly captures and passes all arguments (`*args, **kwargs`) to the original function, ensuring that the decorator does not alter how functions are called.

C) True. Decorators are applied sequentially from top to bottom. If another decorator like `@memoize` is added above `@timer`, its effects would be isolated from the timing measurement by `timer`.

D) Incorrect. Asyncio can be used with decorators, and the timing would still correctly measure the CPU-bound time taken by the function, ignoring other asyncio-related tasks or I/O wait times that might not include in a simple timing measurement.
