    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that demonstrates a custom metaclass designed to automatically add a `__repr__` method to any class it decorates. The `__repr__` method should return a string representation of an instance, formatted as "ClassName(instance_id)".

```python
class AutoReprMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if '__repr__' not in dct:
            def custom_repr(self):
                return f"{self.__class__.__name__}({id(self)})"
            dct['__repr__'] = custom_repr
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AutoReprMeta):
    pass

instance = MyClass()
print(instance)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `MyClass` instances will raise an AttributeError when trying to call `__repr__`.
B) When you create an instance of `MyClass`, it will have a custom `__repr__` method that outputs the class name and its unique identifier.
C) The metaclass `AutoReprMeta` can be used on multiple classes, but each class will use its own version of the `__repr__` method.
D) The `AutoReprMeta` metaclass ensures that all methods in a decorated class are automatically renamed to avoid conflicts.
    
    ## Answer
    B) When you create an instance of `MyClass`, it will have a custom `__repr__` method that outputs the class name and its unique identifier.

Explanation: The correct answer is B. The metaclass `AutoReprMeta` dynamically adds a `__repr__` method to any class it decorates, which in this case is `MyClass`. This method returns a string formatted as "ClassName(instance_id)", where `instance_id` is the memory address of the instance, as returned by Python's built-in `id()` function. Therefore, when you create an instance of `MyClass` and call its `__repr__` method (implicitly done when printing the instance), it will output the class name followed by the unique identifier of that specific instance.
