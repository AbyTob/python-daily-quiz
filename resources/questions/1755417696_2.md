    ## Answer
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following code snippet that uses a decorator to count the number of times a function is called:

```python
from functools import wraps

def call_counter(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        wrapper.call_count += 1
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    wrapper.call_count = 0
    return wrapper

@call_counter
def my_function():
    pass
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `call_counter` decorator will correctly count how many times `my_function` has been called.
B) Accessing `wrapper.call_count` from outside the function will raise an AttributeError because it's not a public attribute.
C) The `wrapper` function does not preserve the name and docstring of `my_function`.
D) Calling `my_function()` will modify the global namespace.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) The `call_counter` decorator will correctly count how many times `my_function` has been called.

Explanation: The `@wraps(func)` decorator from `functools` is used to preserve the metadata of the original function (`my_function`). This means that accessing `my_function.__name__`, `my_function.__doc__`, etc., will return the same values as before the decoration. Additionally, since `wrapper.call_count` is initialized outside the wrapper function and then incremented each time the decorated function is called, it correctly counts how many times `my_function()` has been invoked.
