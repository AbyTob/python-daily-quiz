    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    async def __aenter__(self):
        print(f"Starting {self.name}")
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Finished {self.name} in {end_time:.2f} seconds")

async def main():
    async with Timer("Task 1"):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
    
    async with Timer("Task 2"):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the output of this code when run?

A) Starting Task 1  
   Finished Task 1 in 1.00 seconds  
   Starting Task 2  
   Finished Task 2 in 0.50 seconds

B) Starting Task 1  
   Starting Task 2  
   Finished Task 1 in 1.00 seconds  
   Finished Task 2 in 0.50 seconds

C) Starting Task 1  
   Starting Task 2  
   Finished Task 2 in 1.00 seconds  
   Finished Task 1 in 0.50 seconds  

D) Error: __aenter__ is not a coroutine function
    
    ## Answer
    B) Starting Task 1  
   Starting Task 2  
   Finished Task 1 in 1.00 seconds  
   Finished Task 2 in 0.50 seconds

Explanation:
The `Timer` class is designed as an asynchronous context manager using the `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods, which are both defined as coroutines (async functions). When `async with Timer("Task 1"):` is executed, it first calls the `__aenter__` method of the `Timer` instance. This prints "Starting Task 1". Then, it waits for one second using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`. After that, it exits the context manager by calling the `__aexit__` method, which calculates and prints the time taken.

Similarly, when `async with Timer("Task 2"):` is executed, it first calls the `__aenter__` method of another `Timer` instance, printing "Starting Task 2". It then waits for half a second using `await asyncio.sleep(0.5)`. After that, it exits the context manager by calling the `__aexit__` method, which calculates and prints the time taken.

The output shows the correct sequence of events and the times taken for each task, demonstrating how asynchronous context managers can be used to measure execution times in an asynchronous program.
