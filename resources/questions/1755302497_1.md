    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes derived from `BaseClass`:

```python
class BaseMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'method_to_add' not in dct:
            dct['method_to_add'] = lambda self: "Method Added"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(metaclass=BaseMeta):
    pass

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
```

Given this setup, which of the following statements is true about `DerivedClass`?

A) `DerivedClass.method_to_add()` returns "Method Added"
B) Calling `method_to_add()` on an instance of `DerivedClass` raises a `TypeError`
C) Instances of `DerivedClass` cannot call `method_to_add()`
D) The `BaseMeta` metaclass does not affect the behavior of `DerivedClass`
    
    ## Answer
    [A] `DerivedClass.method_to_add()` returns "Method Added"

Explanation:
- The `BaseMeta` metaclass is used to ensure that every class derived from `BaseClass` has a method named `method_to_add`.
- Since `DerivedClass` inherits from `BaseClass`, it automatically gains the `method_to_add` method.
- Therefore, calling `method_to_add()` on an instance of `DerivedClass` will return "Method Added", making option A correct.
