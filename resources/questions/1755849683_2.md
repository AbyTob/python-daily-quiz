    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def task(id):
    print(f"Task {id} started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(f"Task {id} completed")

async def main():
    tasks = [task(i) for i in range(3)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the expected output of this code when run, and what does it demonstrate about Python's handling of concurrency?

A) The tasks will be executed one after another, with a delay between each task.
B) All three tasks will start simultaneously, then all will complete within 1 second.
C) Only the first task will execute before encountering an error.
D) The output is nondeterministic and depends on the scheduling of the event loop.
    
    ## Answer
    B) All three tasks will start simultaneously, then all will complete within 1 second.

This demonstrates that asyncio allows tasks to be scheduled concurrently. Each task starts immediately after being created, and they all complete their sleep operation in parallel, taking a total time of approximately 1 second for all to finish.
