    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to automatically add a `created_at` timestamp to any class it decorates:

```python
from datetime import datetime

class AutoTimestampMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['created_at'] = datetime.now()
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Resource(metaclass=AutoTimestampMeta):
    pass

class Document(Resource):
    content: str
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `Resource` class will have a `created_at` attribute with the current timestamp.

B) When an instance of `Document` is created, it will not have a `created_at` attribute.

C) The `AutoTimestampMeta` metaclass cannot be used to create other classes besides `Resource`.

D) The `created_at` attribute will be added to all subclasses of `Document`, but not to the `Resource` class itself.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `Resource` class will have a `created_at` attribute with the current timestamp.

Explanation: The metaclass `AutoTimestampMeta` is applied to the `Resource` class, which adds a `created_at` attribute with the current timestamp when the class is defined. Since no other classes are explicitly decorated or subclassed in this example, only instances of `Resource` and its subclasses will have access to this automatically added attribute.
