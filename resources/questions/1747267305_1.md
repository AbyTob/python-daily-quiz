    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a singleton pattern using metaclasses:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 42

# Example usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Should print True
print(obj1.value)
```

Which of the following statements about this code is incorrect?

A. The `SingletonMeta` metaclass correctly implements the singleton pattern.
B. Instances of `MyClass` are created only once, ensuring that `obj1` and `obj2` refer to the same object.
C. The `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` checks if an instance already exists before creating a new one.
D. The `value` attribute is correctly set for both `obj1` and `obj2`.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A. The statement "The `SingletonMeta` metaclass correctly implements the singleton pattern" is incorrect.

Explanation: While `SingletonMeta` does ensure that only one instance of `MyClass` is created, it uses a class-level dictionary `_instances` to store instances. This approach might not be thread-safe in a multi-threaded environment where multiple threads could potentially create instances simultaneously before any have been added to the dictionary. A more robust solution would involve using threading locks or atomic operations to ensure thread safety when checking and setting `_instances`.
