    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to implement a caching mechanism for function results using decorators:

```python
def cache_results(func):
    cache = {}
    
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        cache[args] = result
        return result
    
    return wrapper

@cache_results
def expensive_function(x):
    print(f"Computing {x}...")
    return x * 1000

# Usage
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should compute and cache the result
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should retrieve the cached result
print(expensive_function(10)) # Should compute and cache a new result
```

Which of the following is true about this implementation?

A) The `cache_results` decorator works as intended, caching results based on the function arguments.

B) The `wrapper` function correctly handles both positional (`args`) and keyword (`kwargs`) arguments, but it fails to handle cases where the same argument values are used with different types.

C) The implementation is thread-safe because it uses a dictionary for caching.

D) The `cache_results` decorator can be applied to methods of a class without any issues.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `cache_results` decorator works as intended, caching results based on the function arguments.

**Explanation:**

The provided code snippet is a typical implementation of a decorator that caches the results of function calls based on their arguments. The `wrapper` function checks if the result for the given arguments is already in the cache. If it is, it returns the cached result; otherwise, it computes the result, stores it in the cache, and then returns the computed value.

- Option A is correct because the code works as intended for caching results based on arguments.
- Option B is incorrect because while the code handles `args` correctly, it does not handle `kwargs`. If different keyword arguments lead to the same positional arguments, they will overwrite each other in the cache.
- Option C is incorrect because dictionaries are not inherently thread-safe. In a multi-threaded environment, concurrent access and modification of the cache dictionary would require additional synchronization mechanisms like locks.
- Option D is incorrect because decorators on methods need to be more complex due to the presence of `self` as an argument in methods. The decorator needs to handle this special case appropriately.

This question tests deep understanding of how decorators work and their limitations, especially when it comes to handling different types of arguments and thread safety.
