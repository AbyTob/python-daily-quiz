    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a metaclass to modify class behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'my_method' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Class must implement my_method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# This should work without error
class CorrectImplementation(MyClass):
    def my_method(self):
        print("Method implemented")

# This should raise a TypeError
try:
    class IncorrectImplementation(MyClass):
        pass
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```

What will be the output of the code when run?

A) "Method implemented"  
B) TypeError: Class must implement my_method  
C) No output, but an exception will occur in the background  
D) The program will not run due to syntax errors
    
    ## Answer
    B) TypeError: Class must implement my_method

Explanation:
The metaclass `Meta` checks if 'my_method' is implemented in any class it tries to create. In the case of `CorrectImplementation`, 'my_method' is implemented, so no error occurs. However, for `IncorrectImplementation`, since 'my_method' is not defined, a TypeError will be raised with the message "Class must implement my_method".
