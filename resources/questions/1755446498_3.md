    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator and a metaclass:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class Base(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Decorator is called")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
class MyClass(Base):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print(f"Class method of {cls.__name__}")

obj = MyClass(10)
MyClass.class_method()
```
