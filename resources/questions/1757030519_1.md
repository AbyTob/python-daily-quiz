# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question): Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to log every method call on an instance of a class:

```python
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = cls._log_method_call(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def _log_method_call(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Calling method: {func.__name__}")
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

class MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1
```

Which of the following statements is true about the `MyClass` and its instances?

A) The `increment` method will log each call, showing "Calling method: increment".
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print "Calling method: __init__".
C) Calling `instance.increment()` will not log any calls because methods are not redefined in the metaclass.
D) The `LoggingMeta` metaclass modifies only the class attributes that are callable.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer): A) The `increment` method will log each call, showing "Calling method: increment".

Explanation:
- Option A is correct because the `LoggingMeta` metaclass replaces every callable attribute of the class with a wrapped version that logs the method name before calling the original method.
- Option B is incorrect because `__init__` is not a callable attribute in this context; it's an instance method, and thus not affected by the metaclass modification.
- Option C is incorrect as well because `increment` is indeed replaced with its logged version during class creation.
- Option D is not entirely correct. While methods are redefined, the metaclass does not specifically target callable attributes; it applies to all attribute values of the class.
