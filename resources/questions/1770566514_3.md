    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a metaclass and class decoration to track all instances of a class:

```python
class InstanceTracker(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        cls._instances[id(instance)] = instance
        return instance
    
def register_instance(cls):
    cls.__metaclass__ = InstanceTracker

@register_instance
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Create instances of MyClass
obj1 = MyClass(10)
obj2 = MyClass(20)

print(f"Number of instances: {len(MyClass._instances)}")
```

What will the output be when running this code?  
A) Number of instances: 0  
B) Number of instances: 1  
C) Number of instances: 2  
D) The code will raise an error
    
    ## Answer
    C) Number of instances: 2  
Explanation: The `register_instance` decorator sets the metaclass of `MyClass` to `InstanceTracker`, which overrides the `__call__` method. This method is called every time a new instance of `MyClass` is created, and it stores each instance in a class-level dictionary `_instances`. Therefore, when we create two instances of `MyClass`, they are stored in `_instances`, resulting in a total of 2 instances being tracked.
