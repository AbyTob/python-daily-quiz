    ## Answer
    **Question:**
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return asyncio.run(self.func(*args, **kwargs))

@AsyncDecorator
async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Data fetched"

async def main():
    result = fetch_data()
    print(result)

# Run the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

1. What does `AsyncDecorator` do?
   A) It synchronizes asynchronous functions to run in parallel.
   
   B) It decorates an asynchronous function to ensure it runs within an asyncio event loop.
   
   C) It converts a synchronous function into an asynchronous function.
   
   D) It blocks the execution of asynchronous functions.

2. What will be printed when you run the code?
   A) "Fetching data..."
   
   B) "Data fetched"
   
   C) Both "Fetching data..." and "Data fetched"
   
   D) The program will hang indefinitely

**Answer:**
B) It decorates an asynchronous function to ensure it runs within an asyncio event loop.

C) Both "Fetching data..." and "Data fetched"

Explanation:
- `AsyncDecorator` is a decorator that wraps around another coroutine (`fetch_data`). When called, it uses `asyncio.run()` to execute the coroutine in the current asyncio event loop.
- The `main` function then calls the decorated `fetch_data`, which will print "Fetching data..." and wait for 2 seconds before printing "Data fetched".
- Running this code will output both messages as expected.
