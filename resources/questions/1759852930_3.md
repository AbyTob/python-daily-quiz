    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify the behavior of classes. The goal is to automatically add a `created_at` attribute to any class it decorates with a timestamp when an instance of the class is created.

```python
import time

class TimestampMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'created_at' not in dct:
            dct['created_at'] = time.time()
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=TimestampMeta):
    pass
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior of `MyClass` after it has been decorated with the `TimestampMeta` metaclass?

A) Each instance of `MyClass` will have a unique `created_at` timestamp.

B) All instances of `MyClass` will share the same `created_at` timestamp.

C) The `created_at` attribute will not be added to instances of `MyClass`.

D) Attempting to create an instance of `MyClass` will raise an error.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Each instance of `MyClass` will have a unique `created_at` timestamp.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `TimestampMeta` adds a `created_at` attribute to any class it decorates. This is done in the `__new__` method where it checks if 'created_at' is not already in the dictionary `dct`. If not, it adds the current time as a timestamp.
- Each time an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `__new__` method of its metaclass will be invoked. This means that each instance will get its own unique `created_at` timestamp at the moment of creation.
- Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:
  - Option B suggests all instances share a single timestamp, which is not what happens due to the use of `time.time()` inside `__new__`.
  - Option C is incorrect as the `created_at` attribute is successfully added to each instance.
  - Option D incorrectly implies that creating an instance will raise an error, which does not occur with this implementation.
