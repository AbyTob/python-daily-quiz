    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a custom decorator to measure the execution time of a function. However, it does not work as intended due to an issue with its implementation.

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

# When compute_sum(1000) is called, it does not print the expected execution time.
print(compute_sum(1000))
```

Which of the following options correctly explains why the `compute_sum` function does not print its execution time as expected?

A) The decorator `timing_decorator` is defined using a class rather than a function.

B) The decorator `timing_decorator` is not being applied to the function correctly because it lacks proper syntax.

C) The `wrapper` function within `timing_decorator` does not return the result of the original function call.

D) None of the above. The code works as expected and no changes are needed.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The decorator `timing_decorator` is defined using a class rather than a function.

**Explanation:** Decorators in Python should be implemented as functions, not classes. In this case, defining the decorator as a class would require calling the instance of the class with parentheses, which would alter the decorator's syntax and prevent it from working correctly when applied to a function.
