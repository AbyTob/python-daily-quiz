    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

def timed_function(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Timer exited in {end_time - self.start_time:.4f} seconds")

@timed_function
def long_running_task():
    for i in range(1000000):
        pass

with Timer():
    long_running_task()
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `Timer` class will always print a timing that is exactly the same as what `timed_function` prints.

B) Both `timed_function` and `Timer` are decorators, but they can be used interchangeably.

C) The `Timer` context manager will provide more precise timing than the `timed_function`.

D) The `timed_function` decorator is applied to the function inside the `with Timer()` block.

### Part 2 (Answer)
**
    
    ## Answer
    C) The `Timer` context manager will provide more precise timing than the `timed_function`.**

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Option A:** Incorrect. While both decorators and context managers can be used for timing, the `Timer` class provides more precision due to its use of the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, which are called at the exact start and end of the block respectively.
  
- **Option B:** Correct. Both `timed_function` and `Timer` can be used as decorators, but they serve different purposes. The decorator is useful for adding functionality to existing functions without changing their interface, while the context manager provides a way to manage resources (like file handles or timers) in a more controlled manner.
  
- **Option C:** Correct. The `Timer` class offers more precision because it measures the time between the exact entry and exit of the block where it is used. This eliminates any overhead that might be incurred by function calls, providing a more accurate timing.

- **Option D:** Incorrect. The `timed_function` decorator is applied to the `long_running_task` function before entering the context manager block with `Timer()`. Thus, the decorator's timing will include the time spent both inside and outside the `with Timer()` block.
