    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

class ThreadSafeCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def increment(self):
        with self.lock:
            self.count += 1

def worker(counter, num_iterations):
    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        counter.increment()

def main():
    num_threads = 10
    num_iterations = 10000
    threads = []
    counter = ThreadSafeCounter()

    for i in range(num_threads):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(counter, num_iterations))
        threads.append(thread)
        thread.start()

    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

    print(f"Final count: {counter.count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

What will be the final value of `counter.count` after all threads have completed execution?

A) 10
B) 10000
C) 100000
D) Not determinable
    
    ## Answer
    B) 10000

Explanation:
In the provided code, a `ThreadSafeCounter` class is defined to ensure thread safety by using a lock in its `increment` method. The `main` function creates multiple threads that each call the `worker` function with an instance of `ThreadSafeCounter` and a number of iterations.

Since the `increment` method uses a lock, it ensures that only one thread can enter the critical section at a time to increment the counter. This prevents race conditions where multiple threads could potentially read and write to the `count` variable simultaneously, leading to incorrect results.

Given that there are 10 threads each running 10,000 iterations of the `increment` method, the total number of increments should be \(10 \times 10,000 = 100,000\). Therefore, the final value of `counter.count` will be 100,000.
