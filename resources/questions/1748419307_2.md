    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def my_coroutine():
    print("Coroutine started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Coroutine finished")

class CoroutineDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return asyncio.run(self.func(*args, **kwargs))

@CoroutineDecorator
async def my_decorated_coroutine():
    print("Decorated coroutine started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Decorated coroutine finished")

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
try:
    loop.run_until_complete(my_decorated_coroutine())
finally:
    loop.close()
```

What will be the output of this code when executed?

A) Coroutine started  
   Decorated coroutine started  
   Coroutine finished  
   Decorated coroutine finished  

B) Coroutine started  
   Coroutine finished  
   Decorated coroutine started  
   Decorated coroutine finished  

C) Coroutine started  
   Decorated coroutine started  
   Decorated coroutine finished  
   Coroutine finished  

D) Coroutine started  
   Coroutine finished
    
    ## Answer
    A) Coroutine started  
   Decorated coroutine started  
   Coroutine finished  
   Decorated coroutine finished  

**Explanation:** The `CoroutineDecorator` class is designed to be a decorator for asynchronous functions. When `my_decorated_coroutine` is called, it first runs the undecorated `my_coroutine`, and then proceeds with its own logic. Since `asyncio.run()` is used inside the decorator to execute the decorated coroutine, both the original and decorated coroutine methods are executed within the same event loop run by `asyncio.run()`. This results in the outputs being interleaved as shown in option A.
