    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a decorator that can be applied to any function or method. This decorator should measure the execution time of the function it decorates, but only if the function returns a specific value. If the function does not return this specific value, the decorator should not record the execution time. Here's an example usage:

```python
@track_execution_time(expected_return_value=42)
def compute_answer():
    # Simulate some computation
    time.sleep(1)
    return 42

@track_execution_time(expected_return_value=42)
def incorrect_answer():
    # Simulate some computation
    time.sleep(1)
    return 99
```

In this example, `compute_answer` should have its execution time recorded, while `incorrect_answer` should not. Write the `track_execution_time` decorator to achieve this functionality.

A) 
```python
import time

def track_execution_time(expected_return_value):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            if result == expected_return_value:
                start_time = time.time()
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                end_time = time.time()
                print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

B) 
```python
import time

def track_execution_time(expected_return_value):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            if result == expected_return_value:
                start_time = time.time()
                # This is incorrect as it re-calls the function
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                end_time = time.time()
                print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

C) 
```python
import time

def track_execution_time(expected_return_value):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            if result == expected_return_value:
                start_time = time.time()
                # This is incorrect as it re-calls the function
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                end_time = time.time()
                print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

D) 
```python
import time

def track_execution_time(expected_return_value):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            if result == expected_return_value:
                start_time = time.time()
                # This is incorrect as it re-calls the function
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                end_time = time.time()
                print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

[ANSWER]
A) is correct. The `track_execution_time` decorator correctly measures the execution time of a function only if it returns the expected value. It does not re-call the function to measure its execution time, which would be incorrect.

B) is incorrect. It incorrectly re-calls the function twice, which would double the execution time and lead to incorrect results.

C) is identical to B and thus also incorrect for the same reasons.

D) is identical to A and thus correct, but the other options are intentionally wrong to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the problem.
