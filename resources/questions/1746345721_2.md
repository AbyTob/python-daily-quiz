    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

You are tasked with optimizing a Python script that involves frequent I/O operations. The current implementation uses synchronous file handling, which is blocking and affects the performance of the application.

To optimize this, you decide to use asynchronous file handling with `asyncio`. However, your script also needs to maintain state across multiple asynchronous tasks without using global variables or mutable shared data structures.

Which of the following approaches would be most suitable for maintaining state between asynchronous tasks while optimizing I/O operations?

A) Using a class-based state management system that inherits from `asyncio.Lock` and handles all state transitions asynchronously

B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup

C) Implementing a custom metaclass that tracks state across asynchronous tasks by intercepting attribute access and modification

D) Creating a global dictionary to store state information, which is thread-safe due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**B) Utilizing a combination of `contextlib.AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` to manage state and ensure proper resource cleanup**

This approach is the most suitable for several reasons:
1. **State Management**: `AsyncExitStack` allows you to manage multiple asynchronous context managers efficiently, ensuring that resources are cleaned up properly even if an exception occurs.
2. **Concurrency Safety**: By using `asyncio.Queue`, you can safely share state across tasks without worrying about race conditions or synchronization issues, making the system more robust and scalable.
3. **Asynchronous Operations**: Since both `AsyncExitStack` and `asyncio.Queue` are asynchronous constructs, they integrate seamlessly with other asynchronous components of your application, improving overall performance and responsiveness.

The other options have limitations:
- **Option A** uses `asyncio.Lock`, which is more for synchronization rather than state management.
- **Option C**, while it might be interesting, introduces unnecessary complexity and potential issues related to maintaining state in a metaclass, especially since metaclasses are not directly designed for this purpose.
- **Option D** relies on the GIL, which would limit performance gains from asynchronous programming, as it doesn't take advantage of multiple cores or threads effectively.
