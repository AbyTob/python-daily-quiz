    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to dynamically add methods to classes:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: "This method was added dynamically"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.dynamic_method())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `dynamic_method` will not be available on instances of `MyClass`.
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will have a method named `dynamic_method` with the specified behavior.
C) This code will raise an error because metaclasses cannot modify methods after the class has been instantiated.
D) The `dynamic_method` will be available on instances of `MyClass`, but its functionality will be different.
    
    ## Answer
    B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will have a method named `dynamic_method` with the specified behavior.

Explanation:
The metaclass `Meta` dynamically adds a method called `dynamic_method` to any class that uses this metaclass. This method is added during the class creation process, not at the time of instance creation. Therefore, when you create an instance of `MyClass` and call `obj.dynamic_method()`, it will execute as expected and output "This method was added dynamically".
