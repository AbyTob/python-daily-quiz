# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**
Consider the following code snippet that attempts to create a custom metaclass that logs method calls on instances of classes it creates. However, the implementation is flawed:

```python
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        for attr_name, attr_value in attrs.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                attrs[attr_name] = cls.log_method_call(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

    @staticmethod
    def log_method_call(method):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Calling {method.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
            return method(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

class MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):
    def my_method(self, x):
        return x * 2
```

Which of the following issues is present in this code?

A) The `log_method_call` decorator does not work as intended because it does not preserve the original method's metadata.

B) The metaclass `LoggingMeta` incorrectly attempts to modify all attributes, including non-callable ones, leading to potential errors.

C) The `wrapper` function captures the wrong instance of `self`, causing issues when called on instances.

D) The logging functionality is correctly implemented but will only work for methods defined within `MyClass`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
A) The correct answer is A. The issue with the provided code is that the `log_method_call` decorator does not preserve the original method's metadata, such as its name, docstring, and signature. This can lead to problems when introspection or other metaprogramming techniques are used later on.

The code should be modified to use `functools.wraps` from the standard library to ensure that the wrapper function preserves the metadata of the original method:

```python
import functools

class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        for attr_name, attr_value in attrs.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                attrs[attr_name] = cls.log_method_call(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

    @staticmethod
    def log_method_call(method):
        @functools.wraps(method)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Calling {method.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
            return method(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

class MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):
    def my_method(self, x):
        """Multiplies the input by 2."""
        return x * 2
```

This modification ensures that the `my_method` within `MyClass` retains its original name and docstring even after being wrapped.
