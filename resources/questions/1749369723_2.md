    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Imagine you are developing a library that needs to ensure that all its classes implement certain methods. You want to create a metaclass that checks if these methods exist during class creation and raises an error if they are missing.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
class MethodCheckerMeta(type):
    required_methods = ['method1', 'method2']

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for method in cls.required_methods:
            if method not in dct:
                raise TypeError(f"Class {name} must implement the '{method}' method.")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=MethodCheckerMeta):
    def method1(self):
        pass

# This will work fine
obj = MyClass()

# Uncommenting the following line will raise an error
# class MyMissingMethodsClass(metaclass=MethodCheckerMeta):
#     pass
```

Which of the following is a potential issue with this implementation?

A) The metaclass does not allow for any additional methods to be added to subclasses after creation.

B) The metaclass raises an error when trying to subclass a class that already implements all required methods.

C) The metaclass will correctly raise an error if a method is missing in any subclass.

D) The metaclass can dynamically add the missing methods to classes during their creation.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The metaclass will correctly raise an error if a method is missing in any subclass.

The implementation of `MethodCheckerMeta` checks for the presence of required methods during class creation using `__new__`. If all methods are present, the class is created successfully. However, this implementation does not prevent subclasses from being created without implementing these methods, so option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that existing classes cannot be subclassed, which is not a concern of this metaclass. Option D is incorrect as well since methods are not dynamically added to classes; they must be defined at the time of class creation or inheritance. The correct answer is C, as the metaclass raises an error if any required method is missing in any subclass during their creation.
