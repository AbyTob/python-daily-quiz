    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a Python metaclass that can dynamically modify the behavior of classes based on their docstrings. Specifically, if a class has a docstring that contains the word "experimental", the metaclass should add an `is_experimental` attribute to the class with the value `True`. Otherwise, it should set `is_experimental` to `False`.

Create a metaclass named `ExperimentalMeta` that achieves this functionality.
    
    ## Answer
    A) Correct. The metaclass can be implemented as follows:

```python
class ExperimentalMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if '.__doc__' in dct and 'experimental' in dct['.__doc__']:
            dct['is_experimental'] = True
        else:
            dct['is_experimental'] = False
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
```

B) Incorrect. The metaclass does not handle the case where a class has no docstring.

C) Incorrect. The metaclass does not correctly set the `is_experimental` attribute for classes without a docstring.

D) Incorrect. The metaclass incorrectly sets `is_experimental` to `True` even if the word "experimental" is not in the docstring.
