    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=Singleton):
    pass
```

1. Which of the following statements is true about the `MyClass` when it is used to create multiple instances?
   A) Each call to `MyClass()` will create a new instance.
   B) Only one instance of `MyClass` can exist at a time, no matter how many times it is instantiated.
   C) The metaclass has no effect, and the class acts like a regular class.
   D) It raises an error because metaclasses cannot be used to enforce singletons.
    
    ## Answer
    B) Only one instance of `MyClass` can exist at a time, no matter how many times it is instantiated.
