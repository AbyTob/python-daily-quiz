    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval
        self.running = False

    async def start(self):
        while self.running:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
            print(f"Timer tick: {self.interval} seconds")

def timer_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        timer = AsyncTimer(interval=1)
        timer.running = True
        asyncio.ensure_future(timer.start())
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
async def async_task():
    print("Task is running")

# Usage
async def main():
    await async_task()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be printed to the console when you run this code?

A) Task is running  
B) Timer tick: 1 seconds Task is running  
C) Task is running Timer tick: 1 seconds  
D) The program will hang forever
    
    ## Answer
    Correct answer: B) Timer tick: 1 seconds Task is running

Explanation:
The `AsyncTimer` class creates a simple timer that prints "Timer tick" every second when the `start` method is called. The `timer_decorator` is applied to the `async_task` function, which starts the timer before calling `async_task`. When you run this code, it will first print "Timer tick: 1 seconds" (from the `AsyncTimer`) and then "Task is running" (from the `async_task`).
