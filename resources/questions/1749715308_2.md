    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching data from {url}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Data for {url}"

async def main():
    urls = ['http://example.com', 'http://example.org', 'http://example.net']
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the provided code?

A) The `fetch_data` function is a synchronous function that fetches data from the given URL.
B) The `main` function uses `asyncio.gather` to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and waits for all of them to complete.
C) The `await asyncio.sleep(1)` in `fetch_data` will block the entire program until 1 second has passed.
D) The code will not execute because it is missing a decorator or context manager.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `main` function uses `asyncio.gather` to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and waits for all of them to complete.

Explanation: The code correctly demonstrates the use of asynchronous functions with `await` in an `asyncio` event loop. The `fetch_data` function is defined with `async def`, indicating it's an asynchronous function that performs a non-blocking operation using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`. The `main` function creates a list of tasks by calling `fetch_data` with different URLs and then uses `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` to run all these tasks concurrently. Finally, it waits for all tasks to complete before printing their results. This demonstrates effective use of asynchronous programming in Python to handle multiple I/O-bound operations efficiently.
