    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a combination of decorators, context managers, and metaclasses. The goal is to understand how these components interact to manage resources efficiently.

```python
from functools import wraps
from contextlib import contextmanager

class Resource:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        print(f"Resource {self.name} created")

    def release(self):
        print(f"Resource {self.name} released")

@contextmanager
def managed_resource(name):
    resource = Resource(name)
    try:
        yield resource
    finally:
        resource.release()

class ResourceMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'resource_name' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Resource class must define a 'resource_name'")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class DataProcessor(metaclass=ResourceMeta):
    resource_name = "data_processor"

    @staticmethod
    def process(data):
        with managed_resource(DataProcessor.resource_name) as resource:
            print(f"Processing data with {resource.name}")
            # Simulate processing by returning the data in uppercase
            return data.upper()

# Usage of DataProcessor
result = DataProcessor.process("Hello, World!")
print(result)
```

Which of the following statements about the code is true?

A) The `ResourceMeta` metaclass ensures that any subclass of `DataProcessor` must define a `resource_name`.

B) The `managed_resource` context manager will create and release a new instance of `Resource` every time it's used.

C) The `DataProcessor.process` method can be called without defining the `resource_name` in a subclass, as long as no resource is managed inside it.

D) The `Resource` class releases its resources automatically when garbage collected, regardless of whether it was managed by the context manager.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) This statement is true. The `ResourceMeta` metaclass checks for the presence of `resource_name` in any subclass of `DataProcessor`, ensuring that all subclasses define this attribute.

B) This statement is false. The `managed_resource` context manager creates and releases a new instance of `Resource` every time it's used within a `with` block, but it does not automatically create a new instance when called outside a `with` block.

C) This statement is false. If the `resource_name` is not defined in a subclass, an error will be raised during class creation due to the metaclass constraint enforced by `ResourceMeta`.

D) This statement is false. The `Resource` class does not release its resources automatically when garbage collected. Instead, it provides a method (`release`) that must be called explicitly to free up resources.
    
    ## Answer
    **Detailed Explanation:**

- **A)** The metaclass ensures that all subclasses of `DataProcessor` are aware of the resource management protocol by requiring them to define a `resource_name`. This is a critical aspect for ensuring consistent behavior across different parts of an application when managing resources.
  
- **B)** The context manager is designed to handle the creation and cleanup of resources automatically within a `with` block. However, it does not create a new instance outside of this context, as its primary purpose is to manage resource lifecycle during execution.

- **C)** This statement misinterprets the role of the metaclass constraint. If the `resource_name` is missing, the subclass will not be created due to the error raised by `ResourceMeta`.

- **D)** Garbage collection in Python is designed to reclaim memory automatically when objects are no longer referenced. The `Resource` class provides a way to explicitly release resources, but it does not rely on garbage collection for resource management.
