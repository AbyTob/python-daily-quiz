    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a metaclass which counts how many instances of its subclasses are created:

```python
class InstanceCounter(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        super().__init__(name, bases, dct)
        cls._instance_count = 0

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        cls._instance_count += 1
        return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceCounter):
    pass

# Creating instances of MyClass
a = MyClass()
b = MyClass()
c = MyClass()

print(MyClass._instance_count)  # Expected output: ?
```

What will be the output when running this code?

A) 0  
B) 1  
C) 3  
D) TypeError
    
    ## Answer
    C) 3

Explanation:
The metaclass `InstanceCounter` is designed to count the number of instances created for its subclasses. When a subclass like `MyClass` is instantiated, the metaclass's `__call__` method is called, incrementing `_instance_count` each time an instance is created. Since three instances (`a`, `b`, and `c`) are created, the final value of `_instance_count` should be 3.
