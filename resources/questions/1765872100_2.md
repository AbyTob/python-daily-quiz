    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass and a decorator to modify the behavior of a class:

```python
import time

class TimerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        original_method = dct.get('run')
        if original_method:
            def timed_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
                start_time = time.time()
                result = original_method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                end_time = time.time()
                print(f"Method {name}.run took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
                return result
            dct['run'] = timed_method
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Benchmark(metaclass=TimerMeta):
    def run(self):
        for i in range(10**6):
            pass

@Benchmark()
def test_function():
    print("Running test_function")
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `test_function` will not be timed because it's not a method of a class.
B) When `test_function()` is called, it prints "Method Benchmark.run took X.XXXX seconds" and then runs its original content.
C) The metaclass `TimerMeta` does nothing to the `test_function`.
D) An error occurs when trying to run `test_function()`, as the metaclass is incorrectly applied.
