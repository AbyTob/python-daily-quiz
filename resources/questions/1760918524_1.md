    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet:
```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return f"Data from {url}"

class AsyncRunner:
    def __init__(self, *coros):
        self.coros = coros

    async def run_all(self):
        results = []
        tasks = [asyncio.create_task(coro()) for coro in self.coros]
        for task in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
            result = await task
            results.append(result)
        return results

async def main():
    runner = AsyncRunner(fetch_data("http://example.com"), fetch_data("http://example.org"))
    data = await runner.run_all()
    print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
This code defines an asynchronous function `fetch_data` that simulates fetching data from a URL. The `AsyncRunner` class is used to run multiple coroutines concurrently and collect their results.

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `fetch_data` function runs synchronously.
B) All tasks are guaranteed to complete before the program exits.
C) The `AsyncRunner` class uses a coroutine pool to manage task execution.
D) The `asyncio.create_task` method returns an awaitable that can be used with `await`.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
D) The `asyncio.create_task` method returns an awaitable that can be used with `await`.

Explanation: The question tests the understanding of asyncio's task creation and execution. Option A is incorrect because `fetch_data` is defined as an asynchronous function, meaning it runs asynchronously when awaited. Option B is not guaranteed because tasks completion does not depend on the order they are created but rather their inherent execution times. Option C is not accurate; while `AsyncRunner` creates tasks using `asyncio.create_task`, it does not explicitly manage a pool of tasks. Only option D accurately describes the behavior of `asyncio.create_task`, which returns an awaitable that can be awaited to get the result of the coroutine when completed.
