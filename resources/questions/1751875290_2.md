# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

def thread_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=func, args=args, kwargs=kwargs)
        thread.start()
        return thread
    return wrapper

@thread_decorator
def my_function(x):
    for i in range(10):
        print(f"Thread {x}: {i}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threads = [my_function(i) for i in range(3)]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
```

What will be the output when you run this code?

A) It will print numbers 0-9 three times, each time by a different thread.
B) It will print numbers 0-2 three times.
C) It will print numbers 0-9 once, but in an unpredictable order.
D) It will raise a TypeError.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) It will print numbers 0-9 three times, each time by a different thread.

Explanation: The `thread_decorator` is applied to `my_function`, which creates and starts a new thread for each call. Therefore, when you run the script, it spawns three threads that each execute `my_function`. Each thread prints numbers 0-9, but since they are running concurrently, the output order will be interleaved.
