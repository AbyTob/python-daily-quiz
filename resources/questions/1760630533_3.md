# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question): You are tasked with creating a Python application that needs to manage multiple tasks concurrently. Each task is represented by an instance of a class `Task`, which has an asynchronous method `run`. You want to ensure that all tasks can run concurrently and safely share resources without interfering with each other.

Design a metaclass `TaskMeta` that will be used to create the `Task` class. The metaclass should:
- Ensure that the `Task` instances are created as coroutines.
- Provide a method `get_all_tasks()` that returns a list of all currently running tasks.

Here is a starting point:

```python
import asyncio

class TaskMeta(type):
    _tasks = []

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        task_coro = asyncio.coroutine(dct['run'])
        dct['run'] = task_coro
        cls._tasks.append(task_coro)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Task(metaclass=TaskMeta):
    async def run(self):
        pass  # Your implementation here

# Example usage:
async def main():
    tasks = [Task(), Task(), Task()]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks.run())

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(main())
print([task for task in TaskMeta._tasks])
```

What should the `run` method inside the `Task` class look like to ensure that the metaclass works as intended?

A) `async def run(self): await asyncio.sleep(1)`
B) `def run(self): return asyncio.sleep(1)`
C) `async def run(self): self._running = True`
D) `def run(self): loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.sleep(1))`

Part 2 (Answer): A) `async def run(self): await asyncio.sleep(1)`

Explanation: The `run` method needs to be an asynchronous function that can be awaited. Option A correctly defines it as an async coroutine, which is required by the metaclass to manage tasks properly. Options B and D would not work because they either return a coroutine object directly or block the main thread, respectively, preventing concurrent execution of tasks. Option C does not perform any task execution but just sets a flag, which is not relevant to the metaclass's functionality in this context.
