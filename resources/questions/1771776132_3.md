# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval
        self.tasks = []

    async def start(self):
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
            for task in self.tasks[:]:
                if task.is_running():
                    await task.continue_task()

    def add_task(self, task):
        self.tasks.append(task)

class AsyncTask:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

    async def continue_task(self):
        print(f"Running task {self.name}")

async def main():
    timer = AsyncTimer(2)
    task1 = AsyncTask("task1")
    task2 = AsyncTask("task2")

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.create_task(timer.start())
    timer.add_task(task1)
    timer.add_task(task2)

    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    loop.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Question:**
What happens when the `AsyncTimer` starts and how does it manage the tasks?

A) It runs indefinitely, updating the state of each task every second.

B) It stops after 2 seconds because no tasks are scheduled to run.

C) It runs indefinitely but does not start any tasks immediately.

D) It throws an error because `continue_task` is not awaited within `start`.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)
**A) It runs indefinitely, updating the state of each task every second.**

**Explanation:**
The `AsyncTimer` class has an asynchronous `start` method that runs in a loop, sleeping for the specified interval and then checking if any tasks are running using `is_running()`. Since no actual check is implemented in this simplified version, the assumption is that it would run indefinitely and update the state of each task every second. The tasks themselves, however, do not seem to have a mechanism to set their own running state, so they might not behave as expected without additional logic to track their status internally or externally.
