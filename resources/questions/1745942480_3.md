# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
You are tasked with creating a Python decorator that can be used to measure the execution time of any function it decorates. The decorator should be able to handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions seamlessly.

```python
import time

# Your metaclass or decorator goes here
def timing_decorator(func):
    pass

@timing_decorator
def sync_function():
    time.sleep(1)

async def async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

Which of the following best demonstrates how to implement this `timing_decorator`?

A) Use a metaclass to dynamically add timing logic at class creation.
B) Create a synchronous decorator that uses the `time.time()` method.
C) Create an asynchronous decorator that uses the `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete()` method.
D) Implement both a synchronous and an asynchronous decorator, each using its respective timing method.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] D  
The correct implementation involves creating two separate decorators: one for synchronous functions and another for asynchronous functions. The synchronous version will use `time.time()`, while the asynchronous version will utilize `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete()` to measure execution time accurately.
