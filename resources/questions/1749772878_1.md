    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code that uses a decorator to monitor how many times a function has been called:

```python
def call_counter(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        wrapper.count += 1
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    wrapper.count = 0
    return wrapper

@call_counter
def my_function():
    pass
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) Calling `my_function()` directly will increment the count.
B) The count can be reset to zero by setting `my_function.count` to 0.
C) The decorator adds a new attribute `count` to the original function.
D) The `wrapper` function has access to and modifies the non-local variable `count`.
    
    ## Answer
    A) Calling `my_function()` directly will increment the count.

Correct. When you call `my_function()`, it is actually calling the `wrapper` function, which increments the `count` attribute of itself each time it's called before invoking the original `func`.
