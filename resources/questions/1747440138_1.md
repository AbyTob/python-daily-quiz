    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a simple async web server using `asyncio`:

```python
import asyncio

class WebServer:
    def __init__(self, host, port):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port

    async def handle_request(self, reader, writer):
        data = await reader.read(100)
        message = data.decode()
        addr = writer.get_extra_info('peername')
        print(f"Received {message!r} from {addr!r}")
        writer.write(data.upper())
        await writer.drain()
        writer.close()

    async def start(self):
        server = await asyncio.start_server(self.handle_request, self.host, self.port)
        addr = server.sockets[0].getsockname()
        print(f'Serving on {addr}')
        async with server:
            await server.serve_forever()

def run_server():
    web_server = WebServer('127.0.0.1', 8888)
    asyncio.run(web_server.start())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_server()
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `WebServer` class can be instantiated and its methods called directly without any issues.

B) Calling `asyncio.run(web_server.start())` will cause a runtime error because `web_server.start()` is an async method and should not be awaited directly inside `run_server`.

C) The server listens on the specified host and port, handles client connections asynchronously, and echoes back the received data in uppercase.

D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    C) The server listens on the specified host and port, handles client connections asynchronously, and echoes back the received data in uppercase.

Explanation:
- The `WebServer` class is properly defined with an asynchronous method `handle_request` to handle incoming client requests.
- The `start` method sets up and starts the asyncio server, which correctly awaits the `serve_forever()` call.
- When `asyncio.run(web_server.start())` is called in `run_server`, it executes the async function as expected, without awaiting it directly inside another async function or coroutine. This is valid because `asyncio.run()` takes care of running the main entry point for asyncio programs.

The correct use of asyncio and the proper setup of an asynchronous server make option C true.
