    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def task(name):
    print(f"Task {name} started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(f"Task {name} completed")

async def main():
    tasks = [task(i) for i in range(3)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The program will print "Task 0 started" before printing "Task 1 started".
B) The tasks are executed concurrently, but their completion order is not guaranteed.
C) All tasks must be completed in the order they were created.
D) The program will raise an error because asyncio.sleep() does not work with async functions.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The tasks are executed concurrently, but their completion order is not guaranteed.

Explanation:
The code demonstrates the use of asyncio to execute multiple tasks concurrently. When `asyncio.gather` is used with multiple awaitable objects (in this case, asynchronous functions), it runs them all at the same time and waits for all to complete. The order in which the tasks start executing can be determined by Python's event loop scheduler, but there is no guarantee about their completion order. This makes option B correct while options A, C, and D are incorrect.
