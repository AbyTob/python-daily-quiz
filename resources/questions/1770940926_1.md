    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a singleton pattern using a decorator:

```python
def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    return get_instance

@singleton
class DatabaseConnection:
    _connection = None
    def __init__(self):
        if self._connection is None:
            print("Connecting to database...")
            self._connection = "Database Connected"
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot create more than one instance")

# Example usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
print(db1._connection)

db2 = DatabaseConnection()
print(db2._connection)
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `singleton` decorator correctly ensures that only one instance of `DatabaseConnection` can be created.
B) When `db1` and `db2` are instantiated, they both print "Connecting to database..." and "Database Connected".
C) The `__init__` method in `DatabaseConnection` is never called after the first instance is created.
D) The `singleton` decorator will raise an exception if you try to create a second instance of `DatabaseConnection`.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] C) The `__init__` method in `DatabaseConnection` is never called after the first instance is created.

**Explanation**: The singleton pattern implemented here does not correctly enforce that only one instance of `DatabaseConnection` can be created. Instead, it allows multiple instances to be created by using the decorator's closure to store and return existing instances. The `_connection` attribute in `DatabaseConnection` is not used or updated based on whether an instance already exists. Therefore, each time a new instance is "created" through the singleton decorator, it prints "Connecting to database..." even though an instance already exists.
