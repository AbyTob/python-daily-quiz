    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to control class creation:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'x' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Class must have an attribute 'x'")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    x = 10
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) When `MyClass` is defined, it does not raise any errors.
B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.
C) The metaclass `Meta` can be used to enforce that all classes inheriting from `MyClass` must also define an attribute `x`.
D) The metaclass `Meta` cannot be instantiated directly.
    
    ## Answer
    B) If you remove the line `x = 10` from `MyClass`, it will raise a `TypeError`.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because the code does not run without errors. It raises a `TypeError` during class creation.
- Option C is incorrect because metaclasses like `Meta` control the creation of classes, not their inheritance.
- Option D is correct because a metaclass itself is just a class that inherits from `type`, and it can be instantiated as any other class.
- Option B is correct. The metaclass `Meta` checks if the attribute `x` is present in the class dictionary when the class is being created. If it's not, it raises a `TypeError`.
