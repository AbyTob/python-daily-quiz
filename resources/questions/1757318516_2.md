    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of `Singleton` can be created throughout the application.

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=Singleton):
    def query(self, sql):
        print(f"Executing query: {sql}")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 == db2)  # True or False?
db1.query("SELECT * FROM users")
```

Which of the following statements is correct about the behavior of the `Database` class?

A) The output will be `False`, and each call to `query()` will print "Executing query: SELECT * FROM users" twice.

B) The output will be `True`, but only one query will be executed, printing "Executing query: SELECT * FROM users" once.

C) The output will be `True`, and both calls to `query()` will print "Executing query: SELECT * FROM users" twice.

D) The code will raise an error because the metaclass is not used correctly.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The output will be `True`, but only one query will be executed, printing "Executing query: SELECT * FROM users" once.

Explanation:

- The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that when `Database()` is called multiple times, it always returns the same instance stored in `_instances`.
- Therefore, `db1 == db2` will result in `True`, as both variables reference the same singleton instance.
- When `query()` is called on either `db1` or `db2`, only one query is executed because they are the same instance.
