    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to dynamically add methods to a class at runtime:

```python
class DynamicMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {self.name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=DynamicMethodMeta):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

# Usage
obj = MyClass("Example")
print(obj.dynamic_method())
```

What is the output of this code?

A) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'dynamic_method'

B) TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class MyClass with abstract methods dynamic_method

C) Hello from Example

D) None
    
    ## Answer
    C) Hello from Example

Explanation: The metaclass `DynamicMethodMeta` dynamically adds a method `dynamic_method` to the class `MyClass`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it includes this new method. Calling `obj.dynamic_method()` successfully executes the dynamically added method and prints "Hello from Example".
