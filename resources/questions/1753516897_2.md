    ## Question
    
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        super().__init__(name, bases, dct)
        print(f"Class {name} is being created")

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

@MyClass.register
class AnotherClass:
    pass
```

What will be the output of running this code and explain why?

A) Class MyClass is being created  
   Class AnotherClass is being registered  

B) Class MyClass is being created  

C) Class MyClass is being created  
   Class AnotherClass is being created  

D) Class AnotherClass is being created  

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Class MyClass is being created  
   Class AnotherClass is being registered  

Explanation:
- When a class `MyClass` is defined with a metaclass `Meta`, the metaclass's `__init__` method gets called immediately upon class creation.
- The `@MyClass.register` decorator adds `AnotherClass` to the set of classes managed by `MyClass`. However, this registration happens after the `__init__` method of `Meta` has already executed for `MyClass`.
- Therefore, when you create an instance of `MyClass`, it will print "Class MyClass is being created" first. Then, because `AnotherClass` registers itself with `MyClass`, it prints "Class AnotherClass is being registered".

This question tests the understanding of metaclass behavior and the interaction between class creation and registration in Python.
