    ## Question
    [QUESTION] 
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith("__"):
                dct[attr_name] = timer(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class TimerClass(metaclass=TimerMeta):
    def sleep(self, seconds):
        time.sleep(seconds)

    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
```

Which of the following statements is true about the `TimerClass`? 

A) The `sleep` and `add` methods are not decorated with the `timer` decorator.
B) The `sleep` method is decorated with the `timer` decorator, but not the `add` method.
C) Both the `sleep` and `add` methods are decorated with the `timer` decorator.
D) Neither the `sleep` nor the `add` methods are decorated with the `timer` decorator.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] C) Both the `sleep` and `add` methods are decorated with the `timer` decorator.

Explanation: The `TimerMeta` metaclass dynamically wraps all callable attributes (methods) of any class defined with this metaclass in a `timer` decorator, which measures and prints the execution time of these methods. Since both `sleep` and `add` are callable and not special methods (those starting or ending with double underscores), they will be decorated by the `TimerMeta`.
