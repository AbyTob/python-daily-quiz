    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to track instances of a class:

```python
class Meta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in Meta._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            Meta._instances[cls] = instance
        return Meta._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Usage
s1 = Singleton(10)
s2 = Singleton(20)

print(s1.value)  # Output: ?
print(s2.value)  # Output: ?
```

What will be the output of the above code?

A) 10, 20  
B) 10, 10  
C) Error  
D) 20, 20
    
    ## Answer
    B) 10, 10

**Explanation:** The `Meta` metaclass is designed as a singleton, meaning it ensures that only one instance of any class using this metaclass can be created. In the provided code, when `s1 = Singleton(10)` is executed, an instance with value 10 is created and stored in `_instances`. When `s2 = Singleton(20)` is executed, since the `Singleton` class uses the `Meta` metaclass, it checks if an instance already exists. Since one does exist, it returns the existing instance instead of creating a new one. Therefore, both `s1.value` and `s2.value` will be 10.
