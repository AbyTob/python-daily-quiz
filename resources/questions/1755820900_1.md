    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that aims to create a simple caching mechanism for asynchronous functions. The `AsyncCache` class is supposed to cache the results of async functions based on their arguments.

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}

    def __call__(self, func):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            if args in self.cache:
                return self.cache[args]
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            self.cache[args] = result
            return result
        return wrapper

@AsyncCache()
async def fetch_data(url):
    # Simulate an async data fetch operation
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Data from {url}"

# Example usage
async def main():
    data1 = await fetch_data("http://example.com")
    data2 = await fetch_data("http://example.com")  # This should retrieve from cache

    print(data1, data2)

# Run the example
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about the code above is true?

A) The `AsyncCache` class uses a metaclass to achieve caching.
B) The `@AsyncCache()` decorator correctly caches results for async functions based on their arguments.
C) The `fetch_data` function will always perform an actual data fetch operation, as it does not check the cache.
D) The `AsyncCache` class should be used with synchronous functions instead of async functions.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `@AsyncCache()` decorator correctly caches results for async functions based on their arguments.
