# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses metaclasses to track the creation of classes:

```python
class Meta(type):
    created_classes = []

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        instance = super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        cls.created_classes.append(instance)
        return instance

class A(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class B(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Additional classes will be created here
```

What is the expected output of `Meta.created_classes` after creating two additional classes `C` and `D`?

A) `[A, B]`
B) `[A, B, C, D]`
C) An error because `Meta.created_classes` is not accessible from outside the class
D) `[C, D]`
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) `[A, B, C, D]`

Explanation:
The metaclass `Meta` is designed to track all classes created using it by appending them to the list `created_classes`. Initially, two classes `A` and `B` are created, which are added to the `created_classes` list. If we create two additional classes `C` and `D`, they will also be appended to the `created_classes` list, resulting in `[A, B, C, D]`.
