    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses metaclasses to track the instantiation of a class:

```python
class Meta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

a = MyClass()
b = MyClass()

print(a is b)  # Output: True
```

Which of the following statements accurately describes what this code does?

A) The class `MyClass` uses a metaclass to ensure that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created.
B) The metaclass `Meta` ensures that every time an instance of `MyClass` is created, it stores the instance in `_instances` and returns it when called again.
C) The code demonstrates a use case for decorators rather than metaclasses.
D) The output will be `False` because `a` and `b` are two different instances.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
A) The class `MyClass` uses a metaclass to ensure that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created.

Explanation: This code defines a metaclass `Meta` that overrides the `__call__` method. When an instance of a class with this metaclass is created, it checks if an instance already exists in `_instances`. If not, it creates a new instance, stores it in `_instances`, and returns it. Subsequent calls return the stored instance, ensuring only one instance exists. The test `print(a is b)` will output `True` because both `a` and `b` refer to the same instance of `MyClass`.
