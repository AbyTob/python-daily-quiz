    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that aims to create a context manager for measuring the execution time of a block of code:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.time()
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        elapsed = time.time() - self.start
        print(f"Elapsed time: {elapsed:.6f} seconds")
        return False

with Timer():
    # Simulate a long-running task
    for _ in range(1000000):
        pass
```

However, when trying to use this context manager with an asynchronous function, it fails. Your task is to modify the `Timer` class so that it can be used both synchronously and asynchronously.

A) Modify the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to use asyncio's event loop if it exists.
B) Create a separate `AsyncTimer` class that inherits from `Timer` but overrides the context management protocol for async contexts.
C) Use a decorator to convert the `Timer` class into an asynchronous context manager.
D) Implement a new method called `async_enter` and `async_exit` and use them instead of `__enter__` and `__exit__`.
    
    ## Answer
    B) Create a separate `AsyncTimer` class that inherits from `Timer` but overrides the context management protocol for async contexts.

Explanation:
The correct answer is option B. To make the existing `Timer` class work with asynchronous functions, we need to create an `AsyncTimer` class that overrides the context management protocol specifically for use in asynchronous code. This involves implementing methods like `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` instead of the standard `__enter__` and `__exit__`. The existing `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods should be preserved for synchronous use, as they will still work with non-async contexts. By creating a subclass specifically for async usage, we maintain compatibility with both synchronous and asynchronous code without modifying the original class's behavior.
