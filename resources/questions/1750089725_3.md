    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to ensure that all subclasses of `BaseClass` have a specific method `execute`. The intention is to enforce that every subclass implements this method.

```python
class EnforcerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'execute' not in dct:
            raise TypeError(f"Subclass {name} must implement the execute method.")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(metaclass=EnforcerMeta):
    pass

class SubClass(BaseClass):
    def execute(self):
        print("Executing...")

# Attempt to create an instance of SubClass
sub_instance = SubClass()

# Attempt to create an instance of a subclass that does not implement the execute method
try:
    class BadSubClass(BaseClass):
        pass
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the given code?

A) The `execute` method in `SubClass` will not be called when creating an instance of `BaseClass`.

B) When trying to create an instance of `BadSubClass`, a `TypeError` will be raised because `BadSubClass` does not implement the `execute` method.

C) The metaclass `EnforcerMeta` ensures that every subclass of `BaseClass` must have an `__init__` method.

D) When creating an instance of `SubClass`, the output "Executing..." will not be printed to the console because the method is never called.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When trying to create an instance of `BadSubClass`, a `TypeError` will be raised because `BadSubClass` does not implement the `execute` method.

Explanation: The metaclass `EnforcerMeta` overrides the `__new__` method to check if the subclass dictionary includes the `execute` key. If it does not, a `TypeError` is raised with a message indicating that the subclass must implement the `execute` method. In this case, when attempting to create an instance of `BadSubClass`, which does not define the `execute` method, a `TypeError` will be raised as expected.
