    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, timeout):
        self.timeout = timeout

    async def __aenter__(self):
        print("Timer started")
        await asyncio.sleep(self.timeout)
        return "Timer done"

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print("Timer stopped")

async def main():
    async with AsyncTimer(2) as timer_result:
        print(timer_result)

# Running the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `AsyncTimer` class defines a context manager that waits for 1 second before returning "Timer done".

B) The `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods are not required to be `async`.

C) When used in an `async with` statement, the event loop does not start automatically.

D) The `AsyncTimer` class can be used both as a context manager and an iterator.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) is incorrect because the timeout set in the constructor of `AsyncTimer` is 2 seconds, not 1 second.

B) is incorrect. Both `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods must be asynchronous if they are being used with an `async with` statement.

C) is correct. When using an `async with` statement, the event loop does start automatically as long as it is running when the statement is executed.

D) is incorrect. The `AsyncTimer` class cannot be used as an iterator because it only defines methods for context management (`__aenter__` and `__aexit__`).
