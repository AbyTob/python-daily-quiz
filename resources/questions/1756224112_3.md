    ## Question
    ### Question:
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to dynamically add methods to classes based on their attributes:

```python
class DynamicMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name in dct:
            if attr_name.startswith('_'):
                continue
            dct[f'log_{attr_name}'] = lambda self: f"Logging {attr_name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=DynamicMethodMeta):
    x = 10
    y = 20

# Example usage:
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.log_x())  # Expected output: Logging x
```

What does the `DynamicMethodMeta` metaclass do? Additionally, what is the expected output when running the code snippet?

A) The metaclass dynamically adds a method named `log_x` to `MyClass`. When called, it logs "Logging x".

B) The metaclass dynamically adds a method named `log_y` to `MyClass`. When called, it logs "Logging y".

C) The metaclass dynamically adds methods for every attribute in the class. When called, they all log "Logging <attribute_name>".

D) None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Answer:
**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** 
The `DynamicMethodMeta` metaclass works by inspecting each attribute of a class during its creation (`__new__` method). If an attribute does not start with an underscore, it dynamically creates a new method in the form of `log_<attribute_name>`. This method logs "Logging <attribute_name>" when called. In this specific example, `MyClass` has two attributes, `x` and `y`. Therefore, the metaclass adds two methods: `log_x` and `log_y`. When `obj.log_x()` is called, it returns "Logging x", as expected.
