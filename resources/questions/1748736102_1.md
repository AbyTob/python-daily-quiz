    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that aims to create a decorator which measures the execution time of any function it decorates. However, there is a critical issue in the implementation. Identify the problem with the provided code.

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    start_time = time.time()
    func()
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

@timing_decorator
def my_function():
    time.sleep(2)
```

Which of the following statements correctly identifies the issue with this implementation?

A) The decorator does not pass arguments to the decorated function.
B) The decorator does not handle functions with parameters.
C) The decorator prints the execution time every time it is called, which can be inefficient.
D) The decorator measures the time from when the decorator is defined, not when the function is called.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The decorator does not pass arguments to the decorated function.

**Explanation:**  
The provided code has several issues. First and foremost, it does not account for any arguments that might be passed to the decorated function. When `my_function()` is called inside the decorator, it is not aware of any parameters that were passed to it. Additionally, the decorator should ideally handle functions with parameters gracefully by accepting *args and **kwargs so that it can forward these to the actual function call. The other options are either not directly related to the core issue or are less significant compared to the fundamental problem of argument handling in the decorator.
