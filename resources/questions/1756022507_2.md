Part 1 (Question):  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of a class can be created, regardless of how many times it is instantiated.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class SingletonClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Example usage
instance1 = SingletonClass()
instance2 = SingletonClass()

print(instance1 is instance2)  # Should print True
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that all classes using it are singletons.

B) The `__call__` method of `SingletonMeta` checks if an instance already exists and creates a new one if not.

C) The `SingletonClass` can be instantiated multiple times without any issues.

D) None of the above.

Part 2 (Answer):  
B) The `__call__` method of `SingletonMeta` checks if an instance already exists and creates a new one if not.

Explanation: In the provided code, the metaclass `SingletonMeta` overrides the `__call__` method to ensure that only one instance of each class using it is created. When an instance is requested, it first checks if an instance already exists in `_instances`. If it does, it returns that instance; otherwise, it creates a new instance and stores it in `_instances`. This guarantees that all instances of `SingletonClass` are the same object, thus achieving the singleton pattern.
