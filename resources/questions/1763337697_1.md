    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a decorator for asynchronous functions:

```python
import asyncio

def async_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return asyncio.run(func(*args, **kwargs))
    return wrapper

@async_decorator
async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data fetched"

# Usage of the decorated function
result = fetch_data()
print(result)
```

What is likely to happen when you run this code?

A) The program will print "Data fetched" immediately.

B) The program will wait for 1 second before printing "Data fetched".

C) The program will raise an error because `async_decorator` cannot handle asynchronous functions.

D) The program will hang and not execute at all.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The program will print "Data fetched" immediately.

Explanation: 
The decorator `async_decorator` wraps the original function `fetch_data`, which is declared as `async`. However, the `wrapper` function inside the decorator does not use `await` when calling `func(*args, **kwargs)`. As a result, it attempts to run the asynchronous function synchronously with `asyncio.run()`, which blocks until the function completes. Since the `fetch_data` function simulates an I/O operation with `await asyncio.sleep(1)`, the program will indeed wait for 1 second before printing "Data fetched".
