    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
You are tasked with creating a Python decorator that can be applied to both functions and class methods. The decorator should log the function call details including the arguments passed, but it should handle both regular functions and static/class methods correctly. Implement this decorator and demonstrate its usage on a sample function and a class method.

```python
# Decorator implementation
def log_calls(func):
    pass

# Example usage of the decorator on a function
@log_calls
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example usage of the decorator on a class method
class Calculator:
    @staticmethod
    @log_calls
    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y

# Test cases
result_add = add(3, 4)
print(result_add)  # Output should be 7 with logged call details

calc = Calculator()
result_multiply = calc.multiply(5, 6)
print(result_multiply)  # Output should be 30 with logged call details
```

### Part 2 (Answer)
**
    
    ## Answer
    A**

**Detailed Explanation:** 
The correct answer involves creating a decorator that can handle both regular functions and static/class methods. This requires using the `functools.wraps` to preserve the original function's metadata and checking if the wrapped method is an instance method, class method, or static method.

Here is a possible implementation of the `log_calls` decorator:

```python
import functools

def log_calls(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if inspect.ismethod(wrapper) and not isinstance(wrapper, staticmethod):
            instance = args[0]
            method_name = func.__name__
            args = args[1:]
        else:
            instance = None
            method_name = func.__qualname__
        
        print(f"Calling {method_name} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{method_name} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Example usage of the decorator on a function
@log_calls
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example usage of the decorator on a class method
class Calculator:
    @staticmethod
    @log_calls
    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y

# Test cases
result_add = add(3, 4)
print(result_add)  # Output should be 7 with logged call details

calc = Calculator()
result_multiply = calc.multiply(5, 6)
print(result_multiply)  # Output should be 30 with logged call details
```

This implementation uses `inspect.ismethod` to differentiate between instance methods and static/class methods. For instance methods, it adjusts the arguments list by removing the first argument which is the instance itself. The decorator logs both the function name and its arguments, providing a clear demonstration of how it can handle different types of callable objects.
