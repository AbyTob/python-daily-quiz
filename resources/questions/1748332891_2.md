    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # True or False?
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the output of the `print` statement?

A) The code will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot be used to create singletons.

B) The print statement will output `False`.

C) The print statement will output `True`.

D) None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The print statement will output `True`.

Explanation: The Singleton metaclass overrides the `__call__` method, which is called whenever an instance of a class is created. If an instance already exists for the class, it returns that instance instead of creating a new one. Therefore, when both `db1` and `db2` are instances of the `Database` class, they refer to the same object in memory, resulting in `True`.
