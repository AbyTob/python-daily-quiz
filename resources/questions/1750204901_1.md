    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class attribute counter. The goal is to count how many instances of the class have been created.

```python
class InstanceCounter(type):
    _instance_count = 0

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        cls._instance_count += 1
        return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

    @classmethod
    def get_instance_count(cls):
        return cls._instance_count

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceCounter):
    pass
```

Now, if you create multiple instances of `MyClass` and then call the class method `get_instance_count`, which value will it return?

A) 0  
B) The number of times `MyClass` was subclassed  
C) The number of instances of `MyClass` created  
D) None of the above

**Part 2: Answer**

C) The number of instances of `MyClass` created

Explanation:
- The metaclass `InstanceCounter` is defined to count the number of instances created by any class that uses it as a metaclass.
- In the `__call__` method, each time an instance of a class using this metaclass is created, `_instance_count` is incremented by 1.
- The `get_instance_count` class method returns the current value of `_instance_count`, which reflects how many instances of classes using `InstanceCounter` have been created.

Thus, if you create multiple instances of `MyClass`, calling `MyClass.get_instance_count()` will return the correct number of instances created.
