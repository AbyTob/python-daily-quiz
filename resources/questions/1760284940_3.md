    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with optimizing a Python application that makes multiple asynchronous HTTP requests. The current implementation uses the `requests` library in synchronous mode, which blocks the execution until each request completes. To improve performance, you decide to use an asynchronous library like `aiohttp`. However, you want to keep your code clean and avoid manually managing tasks and events.

You create a custom decorator to handle asynchronous HTTP requests using `aiohttp`. The decorator should take a URL as an argument and return the response from the server. Here is the initial implementation of the decorator:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

def async_request(url):
    async def wrapper():
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(url) as response:
                return await response.text()
    return wrapper
```

You then use this decorator on a function that fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently. However, when you run the application, it seems that requests are still being made sequentially rather than concurrently. What is the issue with the current implementation of the `async_request` decorator and how can you fix it to ensure that requests are made concurrently?

A) The `wrapper` function does not use `await`, so the requests are executed synchronously.

B) The `asyncio.run()` function should be used to run the main coroutine, but it is missing from the code.

C) The decorator itself needs to be modified to return a coroutine that can be awaited when called.

D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    C) The decorator itself needs to be modified to return a coroutine that can be awaited when called.

The issue with the current implementation is that the `wrapper` function is not defined as an asynchronous function, which means it does not use the `async` keyword. As a result, calling `await wrapper()` will not actually await the completion of the asynchronous request but instead will immediately return the coroutine object itself.

To fix this, you need to modify the decorator to ensure that the inner function is defined using the `async def` syntax and that it returns a coroutine that can be awaited. Here's the corrected version of the decorator:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

def async_request(url):
    async def wrapper():
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(url) as response:
                return await response.text()
    return wrapper
```

When used correctly in your application, this decorator will allow you to make asynchronous HTTP requests concurrently, significantly improving the performance of your application.
