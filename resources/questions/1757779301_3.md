    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval
    
    async def countdown(self):
        while True:
            print(f"Counting down in {self.interval} seconds...")
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)

async def main():
    timer1 = AsyncTimer(5)
    timer2 = AsyncTimer(3)
    
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(timer1.countdown())
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(timer2.countdown())
    
    await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)

# Run the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the expected output when you run this code?

A) Counting down in 5 seconds... and then Counting down in 3 seconds...
B) Counting down in 3 seconds... and then Counting down in 5 seconds...
C) The output alternates between "Counting down in 5 seconds..." and "Counting down in 3 seconds..."
D) The code raises an exception
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer: C**

Explanation: In the provided Python code, both `timer1` and `timer2` are instances of `AsyncTimer`. When they call their `countdown` method asynchronously using `asyncio.create_task`, both tasks run concurrently. Since both tasks are infinite loops, they will continue to print messages every `interval` seconds simultaneously. Because the event loop runs them in parallel, you can expect that both "Counting down in 5 seconds..." and "Counting down in 3 seconds..." messages will be printed alternately as they complete their sleep intervals.
