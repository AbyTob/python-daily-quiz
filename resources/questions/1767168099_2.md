    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code:

```python
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@MyMeta
class MyClass:
    pass

def create_class():
    class LocalClass:
        pass
    return LocalClass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    obj = MyClass()
    create_class()
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the execution and output of this code?

A) The `MyMeta` metaclass will not be called because it's not used in creating any classes.

B) The `MyMeta` metaclass will be called once when `MyClass` is created, and no further calls will occur.

C) Each time `create_class()` is called, the `MyMeta` metaclass will be invoked to create a new class.

D) The output of this script will be an error because the `MyMeta` metaclass does not handle the creation of local classes within functions.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `MyMeta` metaclass will be called once when `MyClass` is created, and no further calls will occur.
