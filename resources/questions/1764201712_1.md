    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to ensure that all instances of a class have a unique identifier. The metaclass should also enforce that no two classes with the same name can be defined in the same module.

```python
from weakref import WeakSet

class UniqueNameMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if name in cls._instances:
            raise TypeError(f"Class '{name}' already exists.")
        instance_set = WeakSet()
        cls._instances[name] = instance_set
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        cls._instances[type(instance).__name__].add(instance)
        return instance

class UniqueClass(metaclass=UniqueNameMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
```

Which of the following statements is true about the `UniqueClass` and its instances?

A) Each instance of `UniqueClass` will have a unique identifier.
B) Multiple classes with the same name can be defined in different modules.
C) The metaclass ensures that no two instances with the same value are created.
D) Instances of `UniqueClass` cannot be garbage collected.
    
    ## Answer
    A) Each instance of `UniqueClass` will have a unique identifier.

Explanation: The `UniqueNameMeta` metaclass uses a dictionary `_instances` to track all classes by their name. When a new class is defined, the metaclass checks if a class with that name already exists and raises a `TypeError` if it does. The metaclass also ensures that each instance of a class is stored in a weak set associated with the class's name, which allows instances to be garbage collected when no longer referenced elsewhere in the program.
