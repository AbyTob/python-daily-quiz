    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Before calling")
        result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After calling")
        return result

@AsyncDecorator
async def my_async_function(x):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an async operation
    return x * x

# Example usage
async def main():
    result = await my_async_function(3)
    print(f"Result: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What happens when you run the above code? Select all that apply:

A) It will raise an error because `AsyncDecorator` does not handle non-async functions.

B) It will print "Before calling", wait for 1 second, then print "After calling" and finally output "Result: 9".

C) It will execute the function synchronously without any additional prints.

D) The program will hang indefinitely because it is waiting for an infinite loop inside `my_async_function`.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) C

Explanation:
- The code defines a class decorator `AsyncDecorator` that wraps around an asynchronous function.
- When `my_async_function` is decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`, the decorator's `__call__` method is invoked when the function is called, not when itâ€™s defined.
- Inside `AsyncDecorator.__call__`, "Before calling" is printed, then the decorated function (`self.func`) is awaited. During this await, control yields back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run.
- After the awaited task completes (in this case, after 1 second), "After calling" is printed, and the result of `my_async_function` is returned.
- When `main()` runs, it calls `await my_async_function(3)`, which results in "Before calling", a 1-second delay, then "After calling", followed by "Result: 9".
- Option A is incorrect because the decorator does handle async functions correctly. Options B and D are incorrect as there's no infinite loop or hanging behavior.
