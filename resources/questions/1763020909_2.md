# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses decorators to modify a function's behavior:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

say_hello("Alice")
```

What will be printed when you run this code?

A) Hello, Alice!  
B) Something is happening before the function is called. Hello, Alice! Something is happening after the function is called.  
C) Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called.  
D) An error occurs
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) Something is happening before the function is called. Hello, Alice! Something is happening after the function is called.

Explanation:
- The `@my_decorator` syntax applies the `my_decorator` decorator to the `say_hello` function.
- When `say_hello("Alice")` is called, it first enters the `wrapper` function inside the `my_decorator`.
- Inside the `wrapper`, it prints "Something is happening before the function is called."
- It then calls the original `say_hello` function with the provided arguments, which prints "Hello, Alice!".
- After the `say_hello` function completes execution, it returns to the `wrapper` and prints "Something is happening after the function is called."

This demonstrates how decorators can be used to add functionality before and after a function call without modifying the original function's code.
