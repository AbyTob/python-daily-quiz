# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
You are tasked with creating a context manager that measures the execution time of any code block it decorates. The context manager should return the elapsed time in seconds as a float. However, you need to ensure that the context manager handles exceptions gracefully and does not raise an error if the code block raises one.

Write a Python class `Timer` that meets the above requirements. Your implementation should use the `time` module for timing.

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        # Start timing
        pass
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        # Stop timing and return elapsed time
        pass

# Example usage:
with Timer() as t:
    result = [i * i for i in range(10000)]
print(f"Elapsed time: {t} seconds")
```
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) `__enter__` should record the start time, and `__exit__` should calculate and return the elapsed time. The exception handling can be done by simply returning `False` in the `__exit__` method to suppress exceptions.

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        elapsed_time = time.time() - self.start_time
        print(f"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds")
        return False  # Suppress exceptions

# Example usage:
with Timer() as t:
    result = [i * i for i in range(10000)]
```

This solution demonstrates how to create a context manager that measures execution time, handles exceptions gracefully, and is easy to use.
