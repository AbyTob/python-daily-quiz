# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to control class creation:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'secret' in dct:
            del dct['secret']
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    secret = "This is a secret"
    public = "Accessible to all"

instance = MyClass()
print(instance.public)  # Output: Accessible to all
```

What will the output be when `MyClass` is instantiated and its `public` attribute is accessed?

A) Accessible to all  
B) Error - 'secret' not defined  
C) Error - '__new__' method not called  
D) None
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) Accessible to all  

Explanation:
The correct answer is A: "Accessible to all". The metaclass `Meta` defines a custom class creation process where it removes any attribute named 'secret' from the dictionary passed to the `__new__` method. In this case, since 'secret' is removed from the `MyClass` dictionary before the class is created, when an instance of `MyClass` is created and its `public` attribute is accessed, it outputs "Accessible to all". This demonstrates how metaclasses can be used to modify or control the creation of classes in Python.
