    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Usage
a = MyClass()
b = MyClass()

print(a is b)  # What will this print?
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior of `MyClass` when it is instantiated multiple times?

A) The output will be `False`, because each instance has its own memory location.
B) The output will be `True`, because only one instance of `MyClass` is created.
C) The output will raise an exception, because singletons cannot have arguments.
D) The output will be unpredictable, depending on the Python interpreter used.

**Part 2 (Answer):**  
The correct answer is B) The output will be `True`, because only one instance of `MyClass` is created. 

Explanation:  
In the provided code, `SingletonMeta` is a metaclass that overrides the `__call__` method to control object creation. When an instance of `MyClass` is created for the first time, it gets stored in `_instances`. Any subsequent attempts to create an instance of `MyClass` will return the already existing instance from `_instances`, ensuring that only one instance exists throughout the program.
