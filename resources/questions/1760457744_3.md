    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval

    async def __aenter__(self):
        print(f"Starting timer for {self.interval} seconds...")
        await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
        print("Timer completed.")
        return None

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if exc_type is not None:
            print(f"Timer failed with exception: {exc_val}")
        else:
            print("Timer succeeded.")

async def main():
    try:
        async with AsyncTimer(5) as timer:
            raise ValueError("Something went wrong!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Caught an exception: {e}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this code when executed? 

A. Starting timer for 5 seconds...
   Timer completed.
   Caught an exception: Something went wrong!

B. Starting timer for 5 seconds...
   Something went wrong!
   Timer failed with exception: None

C. Starting timer for 5 seconds...
   Timer completed.
   Timer succeeded.

D. Starting timer for 5 seconds...
   Timer failed with exception: ValueError('Something went wrong!')
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B. Starting timer for 5 seconds...
   Something went wrong!
   Timer failed with exception: None

Explanation:
The code defines an `AsyncTimer` class that acts as a context manager using `__aenter__` and `__aexit__`. When the `async with` block is entered, it starts a timer for a specified interval and waits for it to complete. Inside the `main` function, an exception (`ValueError`) is raised within the `async with` block. This exception is caught in the `except` block outside the context manager.

In the `__aexit__` method of `AsyncTimer`, since an exception occurred inside the `async with` block, `exc_type` will be `ValueError`, `exc_val` will be the actual exception instance (`ValueError('Something went wrong!')`), and `exc_tb` will be the traceback object. Therefore, "Timer failed with exception: None" is printed because the `exc_val` is not explicitly handled in the `__aexit__` method.

The output of the code will thus be:
- "Starting timer for 5 seconds..."
- "Something went wrong!"
- "Timer failed with exception: None"
