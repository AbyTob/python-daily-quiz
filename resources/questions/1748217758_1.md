    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators, metaclasses, and context managers:

```python
from contextlib import ContextDecorator

class LogDecorator(ContextDecorator):
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering")
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print("Exiting")

def log_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before calling function")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After calling function")
        return result
    return wrapper

class LogMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = log_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=LogMeta):
    @log_decorator
    def method1(self):
        print("Executing method1")

    @LogDecorator()
    def method2(self):
        print("Executing method2")
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) When an instance of `MyClass` calls its methods, all methods are wrapped twice, leading to multiple "Before calling function" and "After calling function" outputs.

B) The `LogMeta` metaclass applies the `log_decorator` to all callable attributes of `MyClass`, effectively wrapping them with a print statement before and after their execution.

C) Using `ContextDecorator` in `LogDecorator` ensures that the `with` statement can be used to manage context, but it will not affect the behavior when called as a regular decorator.

D) The use of both metaclass and decorators on the same methods results in double wrapping due to overlapping effects.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**B**

The `LogMeta` metaclass applies the `log_decorator` to all callable attributes of `MyClass`. This means that both `method1` and `method2` are wrapped with the `log_decorator`, resulting in two "Before calling function" and "After calling function" outputs when they are called. The `ContextDecorator` class is used in `LogDecorator` to ensure it can be used as a context manager, but this does not affect how it behaves when applied as a decorator.

The other statements are incorrect because:
- A) While both methods are wrapped with the `log_decorator`, each method is only wrapped once.
- C) The use of `ContextDecorator` allows the decorator to function as a context manager, but this does not prevent it from also being used as a regular decorator.
- D) The metaclass and decorators do not result in double wrapping. Each method is decorated only once by both the metaclass and the explicit decorator application.
