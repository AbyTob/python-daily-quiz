    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a simple caching mechanism using decorators. The goal is to cache the results of function calls based on their arguments.

```python
from functools import wraps

def cache_results(func):
    cache = {}
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        result = func(*args)
        cache[args] = result
        return result
    return wrapper

@cache_results
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(5))  # Expected output: 5
```

Which of the following is a correct statement regarding the `fibonacci` function when using the `cache_results` decorator?

A) The first call to `fibonacci(5)` will compute all previous Fibonacci numbers up to 3.

B) Subsequent calls to `fibonacci(n)` where `n <= 1` will not be cached.

C) The cache will store results for all arguments passed to `fibonacci`.

D) The cache will only store results for unique sequences of recursive calls that lead to different outcomes.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] D) The cache will only store results for unique sequences of recursive calls that lead to different outcomes.

**Explanation**: The `cache_results` decorator is designed to cache the results of function calls based on their arguments. In this case, it caches the results of the Fibonacci sequence calculations. When a call to `fibonacci(n)` is made, the decorator first checks if the result for those arguments is already in the cache. If not, it computes the result using the function (in this case, the Fibonacci calculation), stores it in the cache, and then returns the result. For recursive functions like `fibonacci`, different sequences of calls to reach the same base case will produce different results, leading to unique keys in the cache. Therefore, only those unique sequences of recursive calls will be cached.
