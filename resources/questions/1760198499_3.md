    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses decorators to create a simple logging system. The goal is to log the entry and exit of functions. However, there are some issues with the current implementation.

```python
import functools

def log_function_calls(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Entering {func.__name__}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Exiting {func.__name__}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_function_calls
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

@log_function_calls
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

print(add(3, 4))
print(multiply(5, 6))
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the current implementation?

A) The decorator works correctly and logs the entry and exit of both functions.
B) The decorator logs only the entry of the functions and not their exit.
C) There is an error in the decorator that prevents it from logging any information.
D) The decorator logs both the entry and exit of the functions but fails to capture arguments.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The decorator works correctly and logs the entry and exit of both functions.

Explanation:
The provided code snippet uses a simple decorator `log_function_calls` to log the entry and exit of functions. The decorator is applied to two functions, `add` and `multiply`. Each function call inside these decorated functions will indeed log its entry and exit with the correct function name, making this statement true.
