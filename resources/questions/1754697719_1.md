    **Part 1 (Question):**  
Consider the following code snippet that uses a decorator to cache results of a function based on its arguments. This caching mechanism is crucial for performance improvement when dealing with expensive or frequently called functions. Your task is to identify what issue might arise if this caching mechanism is used in a multi-threaded environment and suggest a solution.

```python
def memoize(func):
    cache = {}
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in cache:
            cache[args] = func(*args)
        return cache[args]
    return wrapper

@memoize
def compute_expensive_result(x, y):
    # Simulate an expensive computation
    import time; time.sleep(1)
    return x + y

import threading

# Create threads to invoke the function with the same arguments
t1 = threading.Thread(target=compute_expensive_result, args=(5, 3))
t2 = threading.Thread(target=compute_expensive_result, args=(5, 3))

t1.start(); t2.start()
t1.join(); t2.join()

print("Computed values:", compute_expensive_result(5, 3))
```

**Part 2 (Answer):**  
A: The cache is not thread-safe. [Explanation: In the given code, if two threads call `compute_expensive_result` with the same arguments simultaneously, both might miss the cache and start recomputing the value concurrently. This can lead to unnecessary computations and potential race conditions.]

B: The function does not handle exceptions. [Explanation: This option is irrelevant as there are no exceptions being handled in the provided code snippet.]

C: The memoize decorator should be implemented using a lock to ensure thread safety. [Explanation: A correct solution would involve modifying the `memoize` function to include a lock that ensures only one thread can compute and cache the result at a time for the same arguments, preventing race conditions.]

D: The threading module is not being used correctly. [Explanation: This option is incorrect as there are no issues with how threads are created or started in the provided code snippet.]
