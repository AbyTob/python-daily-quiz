# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to enhance the functionality of a class method:

```python
from functools import wraps

def trace(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Calculator:
    @trace
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y

# Usage
calc = Calculator()
print(calc.add(3, 4))
```

What happens if you try to create a subclass of `Calculator` and override the `add` method without using the decorator? Explain the behavior and why it occurs.

A) The `trace` function will still be applied to the overridden method.
B) The `trace` function will not be applied to the overridden method, but the original functionality will be preserved.
C) A TypeError will be raised because decorators cannot be inherited.
D) The overridden method will not have any additional behavior or print statements.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) The `trace` function will still be applied to the overridden method.

Explanation: When a subclass overrides a method, it does not inherit decorators from the parent class. Each method in a class can independently define its own decorators. Therefore, when you override the `add` method in a subclass, any decorators applied to the original method are not automatically inherited or reapplied. In this case, the `trace` decorator is only applied to the `add` method defined directly in the `Calculator` class and not to any overridden versions of it in subclasses.
