    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

class ThreadSafeCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    @property
    def value(self):
        with self.lock:
            return self._value

    @value.setter
    def value(self, new_value):
        with self.lock:
            self._value = new_value

    def increment(self):
        with self.lock:
            self.value += 1

def worker(counter):
    for _ in range(1000):
        counter.increment()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    counter = ThreadSafeCounter()
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(counter,)) for _ in range(10)]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    print(counter.value)
```

This code attempts to create a thread-safe counter using a `ThreadSafeCounter` class with a private attribute `_value` and a lock. The `increment` method is intended to safely increment the value by 1000 across multiple threads.

Which of the following statements is true regarding the above code?

A) The counter will always print 10000 because it uses threading.Lock to ensure thread safety.
B) The counter may print a number less than 10000 due to race conditions in the `increment` method.
C) The counter will always print 10000, but using decorators would make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
D) The counter may print a number greater than 10000 because of potential deadlocks.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The code uses threading to create multiple threads that increment the shared `counter` object. Each thread performs 1000 increments on the counter. The critical section in the `increment` method is protected by a lock, which means that at any given time, only one thread can execute the code within this section.

However, there are race conditions present in the code. Even though each increment operation is atomic (i.e., it cannot be interrupted), multiple threads can still see and modify `_value` concurrently before their changes are fully written back to memory. This can lead to situations where two or more threads read the same value for `_value`, both increment it, and then write back their incremented values, resulting in a net increase of less than 1000 increments.

Therefore, while the lock ensures that individual increment operations are thread-safe, the overall operation is still subject to race conditions when multiple threads attempt to modify the shared counter concurrently. This means that the final value printed by the program may be less than 10000, making option B correct.
