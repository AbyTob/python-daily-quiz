    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to measure the execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f}s")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

# Run the function to observe its behavior
result = compute_sum(1000000)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `timer` decorator will print the execution time every time `compute_sum` is called.
B) The `wrapper` function captures and returns the result of `func`, but it does not modify the result.
C) If `compute_sum` takes a long time to execute, the program will hang due to excessive logging.
D) The `timer` decorator modifies the original `compute_sum` function in place.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `timer` decorator will print the execution time every time `compute_sum` is called.
