    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval

    def __call__(self, coro):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            while True:
                await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
                await coro(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

@AsyncTimer(2)
async def print_time():
    import datetime
    print(datetime.datetime.now())

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
try:
    loop.run_until_complete(print_time())
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
finally:
    loop.close()
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `AsyncTimer` class is a decorator that can be applied to any coroutine function. When applied, it prints the current time every 2 seconds.
B) The `AsyncTimer` class defines a metaclass that modifies coroutine functions.
C) The `print_time` function will run indefinitely but will not print anything because it lacks an `await` statement within the loop.
D) The code will raise a `TypeError` because asyncio coroutines cannot be decorated with non-coroutine functions.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `AsyncTimer` class is a decorator that can be applied to any coroutine function. When applied, it prints the current time every 2 seconds.

Explanation: In this solution, the `AsyncTimer` class is designed as a decorator for asyncio coroutines. It uses a call method to wrap the coroutine and run it in an infinite loop with a sleep interval of 2 seconds between executions. This allows the coroutine `print_time` to be executed repeatedly at fixed intervals, printing the current time each time. Therefore, statement A accurately describes the behavior of the code.
