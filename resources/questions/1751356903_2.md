# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses decorators and metaclasses together:

```python
from functools import wraps

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def my_decorator(cls):
    @wraps(cls)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Decorator called")
        return cls(*args, **kwargs)
    return type(cls.__name__, (), dict(cls.__dict__, __init__=wrapper))

@my_decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

if __name__ == "__main__":
    obj = MyClass(10)
```

What will be the output of this code when run?

A) Creating class MyClass  
Decorator called  
B) Decorator called  
Creating class MyClass  
C) Decorator called  
D) Error: metaclass conflict

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Creating class MyClass  
Decorator called  

**Explanation:** 

The `MyClass` is decorated with `my_decorator`, and the metaclass of `MyClass` is `Meta`. The `__new__` method of the metaclass `Meta` gets called when `MyClass` is created, printing "Creating class MyClass". Then, the decorator `my_decorator` wraps the `__init__` method of `MyClass`, printing "Decorator called" every time an instance of `MyClass` is created. The order of operations here is first the metaclass creation and then the decoration, so the correct output is "Creating class MyClass" followed by "Decorator called".
