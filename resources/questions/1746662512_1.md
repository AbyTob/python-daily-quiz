    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior. The goal is to add an `__init_subclass__` method to any subclass, which initializes each attribute with a default value if it's not provided.

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        cls.__init_subclass__ = lambda self: None

class Base(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class Derived(Base):
    def __init__(self, a=None, b=None):
        if a is not None:
            self.a = a
        if b is not None:
            self.b = b

# Expected behavior:
derived_instance = Derived(a=10)
assert derived_instance.a == 10 and derived_instance.b is None
```

Which of the following changes would correctly implement the desired functionality without breaking any existing code?

A) Change the `Meta` metaclass to modify `__init_subclass__` so that it initializes all attributes in subclasses.

B) Change the `Base` class to use a different metaclass that already implements `__init_subclass__`.

C) Modify the `Derived` class to explicitly call `super().__init_subclass__()` and then define its own `__init_subclass__`.

D) Replace the `Meta` metaclass with a simple `object` type, as it's not needed for this functionality.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] A) Change the `Meta` metaclass to modify `__init_subclass__` so that it initializes all attributes in subclasses.  
**Explanation:** The current implementation of `__init_subclass__` does nothing. By modifying the `Meta` metaclass, you can add behavior to all subclasses by changing how `__init_subclass__` is defined within any subclass. This allows you to initialize attributes with default values if they are not provided.
