    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a simple web server using asyncio:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncWebServer:
    def __init__(self, port):
        self.port = port
        self.server = None

    async def start(self):
        self.server = await asyncio.start_server(self.handle_client, '127.0.0.1', self.port)
        print(f'Server started on {self.port}')
        async with self.server:
            await self.server.serve_forever()

    async def handle_client(self, reader, writer):
        data = await reader.read(100)
        message = data.decode().strip()
        addr = writer.get_extra_info('peername')

        print(f"Received {message!r} from {addr!r}")

        response = f'Echo: {message}'
        writer.write(response.encode())
        await writer.drain()

    async def stop(self):
        if self.server:
            self.server.close()
            await self.server.wait_closed()

async def main():
    server = AsyncWebServer(8888)
    try:
        await server.start()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        await server.stop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The `AsyncWebServer` class is intended to start a web server that echoes back any received data. However, when you run the script and try to connect to it using a simple client like `telnet`, you encounter an issue where no response is received from the server.

Identify the problem in this code and suggest how to fix it so that the server correctly handles incoming connections and sends responses as expected.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**A) The problem is with the `handle_client` method not properly handling client disconnections.**
**B) The issue lies in the `start` method not properly closing the server when stopping.**
**C) There is no actual error; the server works as intended and handles incoming connections correctly.**
**D) The server does not have a timeout mechanism to close idle connections, leading to hanging connections.**

    ## Answer
    A**

**Explanation:** The problem lies in the `handle_client` method. While it sends a response back to the client when data is received, it does not handle the case where the client disconnects unexpectedly (e.g., by closing their connection). This can cause the server to get stuck waiting for more data from the disconnected client, which prevents it from processing other incoming connections. To fix this issue, you could add a check to see if there's any data available before attempting to read from the reader, or use an exception handler within the `handle_client` method to gracefully handle client disconnections.
