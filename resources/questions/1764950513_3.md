    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator for asynchronous functions, ensuring they only run once after their first execution. However, there's an issue with this implementation. Identify and correct the mistake.

```python
import asyncio

def ensure_once(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(wrapper, 'ran'):
            wrapper.ran = True
            return await func(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            print("Function already ran.")
    return wrapper

@ensure_once
async def my_async_function():
    print("Running my_async_function")

# Example usage
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(my_async_function())
loop.run_until_complete(my_async_function())
```

A) The decorator is incorrectly using a class attribute.  
B) The `wrapper` function does not await the call to `func`.  
C) The `wrapper` function lacks the necessary coroutine syntax.  
D) There's no issue with this implementation.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is D) There's no issue with this implementation.

Explanation:
The provided code snippet correctly implements a decorator that ensures an asynchronous function runs only once using an instance attribute (`wrapper.ran`). The `ensure_once` decorator wraps the original function and checks if it has already run. If not, it sets the `ran` attribute to True and proceeds to call the original function asynchronously. After the first execution, any subsequent calls will print "Function already ran." without attempting to execute the function again.

The other options are incorrect because:
A) The use of an instance attribute (`wrapper.ran`) is valid within a coroutine context.
B) There's no need for additional awaits since `await func(*args, **kwargs)` correctly handles asynchronous calls.
C) The `wrapper` function uses the correct syntax for defining and returning an async function.
