    ## Question
    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add an additional method to a class dynamically:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MetaABC(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'abstract_methods' in dct:
            for method_name in dct['abstract_methods']:
                if not any(method_name == attr for attr in dct if callable(dct[attr])):
                    raise TypeError(f"Method {method_name} is abstract but not implemented")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AbstractBase(metaclass=MetaABC):
    abstract_methods = ['mymethod']

class ConcreteClass(AbstractBase):
    def mymethod(self):
        print("Implementation of mymethod")

# Question:
What will happen if we remove the `mymethod` implementation from the `ConcreteClass` and then try to create an instance of it?

A) The metaclass will automatically implement `mymethod`
B) An exception will be raised during class creation
C) An exception will be raised when trying to instantiate `ConcreteClass`
D) The class will still be instantiated without any errors
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2: Answer**

C) An exception will be raised when trying to instantiate `ConcreteClass`

Explanation:
The metaclass `MetaABC` checks during class creation if all methods listed in `abstract_methods` are implemented. If a method is abstract (i.e., it's listed but not implemented), the metaclass raises a `TypeError`. In this case, `AbstractBase` specifies `mymethod` as an abstract method that needs to be implemented by any subclass. When we try to create an instance of `ConcreteClass`, which does not provide an implementation for `mymethod`, the metaclass detects this and raises a `TypeError`.
