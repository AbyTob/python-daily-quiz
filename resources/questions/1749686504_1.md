    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a decorator to measure execution time:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time of {func.__name__}: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def my_function(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        sum += i * i
    return sum

print(my_function(10000))
```

What is the issue with this decorator and how can it be fixed to correctly measure execution time?

A) The `wrapper` function does not store the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, leading to incorrect execution time measurements.

B) The `timer` decorator should use a class instead of a function for better code organization and potential future enhancements.

C) The `wrapper` function does not release any resources it might acquire during execution, which could lead to resource leaks.

D) None of the above. The decorator is correctly implemented to measure execution time.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `wrapper` function does not store the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, leading to incorrect execution time measurements.

The issue with the current implementation is that while it measures the time taken by the function call and prints it, it does not actually use the returned value. This can lead to confusion if the function's return value is being used elsewhere in the code. To fix this, you should store and return the result of `func(*args, **kwargs)` within the `wrapper` function.
