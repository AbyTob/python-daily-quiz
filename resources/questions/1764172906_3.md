    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Person(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class Animal(metaclass=Meta):
    pass
```

Which of the following statements correctly explains why `Person` and `Animal` instances can call a `greet` method?

A) The metaclass adds a `greet` method to every class derived from it.

B) The `greet` method is added at runtime when an instance of `Person` or `Animal` is created.

C) The metaclass dynamically assigns a `greet` method to all attributes of the class during definition.

D) Each class defines its own `greet` method, but the metaclass overrides it in derived classes.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The metaclass adds a `greet` method to every class derived from it.

**Explanation:** In Python, when a class is defined, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called with the class name, its base classes, and a dictionary of attributes. By overriding this method in the `Meta` metaclass, we can dynamically add the `greet` method to any class that uses `Meta` as its metaclass. This ensures that all instances of `Person` and `Animal`, which are both subclasses of `object` (or another base class using `Meta`), will have access to the `greet` method.
