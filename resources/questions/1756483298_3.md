    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to ensure all instances of a class have a specific attribute:

```python
class EnsureAttribute(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['required_attribute'] = 'I must be here'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=EnsureAttribute):
    pass

# Create an instance of MyClass and print the value of required_attribute
instance = MyClass()
print(instance.required_attribute)
```

Which of the following statements is true about the behavior of this code?

A) When `MyClass` is instantiated, it will raise an AttributeError because 'required_attribute' has not been explicitly defined.

B) The `__new__` method of the metaclass `EnsureAttribute` ensures that every subclass of `MyClass` also inherits the `required_attribute`.

C) The value of `instance.required_attribute` will be 'I must be here'.

D) Instances of `MyClass` cannot have their own definition for `required_attribute`.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The value of `instance.required_attribute` will be 'I must be here'.

Explanation:
The metaclass `EnsureAttribute` modifies the dictionary of any class it is applied to by adding a new key-value pair, setting `'required_attribute'` to `'I must be here'`. Since this modification happens at the time the class is defined (not when an instance is created), every instance of `MyClass` will have the attribute `required_attribute` with the specified value.
