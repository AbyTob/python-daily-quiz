# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a decorator to measure the execution time of functions. However, it seems not to work as expected:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def my_function():
    time.sleep(2)

my_function()
```

What is the issue with this implementation of the `timer` decorator, and how can it be fixed to correctly measure and print the execution time?

A) The `wrapper` function is not defined properly.
B) The `timer` decorator is not using a closure correctly.
C) The `start_time` is captured before calling `func`, leading to an incorrect measurement.
D) The `end_time` should be captured before calling `print`.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) This option is incorrect because the `wrapper` function is defined within the `timer` decorator and captures `start_time` correctly.

C) This is the correct answer. The issue lies in the order of operations. `start_time` should be recorded after calling `func`, so that the execution time can be accurately measured from when the function starts to when it ends.

D) While capturing `end_time` before printing would not prevent the code from working, it's a matter of convention and does not fix the issue with the measurement itself.
