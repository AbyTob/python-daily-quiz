    ## Question
    [QUESTION] 
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to implement a simple caching mechanism using decorators:

```python
import functools

def cache(func):
    cache_dict = {}
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if args not in cache_dict:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            cache_dict[args] = result
        return cache_dict[args]
    return wrapper

@cache
def compute_expensive_operation(x):
    print(f"Computing {x}...")
    # Simulate an expensive operation
    return x * 2

# Example usage:
result1 = compute_expensive_operation(5)
result2 = compute_expensive_operation(5)
print(result1, result2)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `cache` decorator will always store and retrieve results based on argument values.
B) If `compute_expensive_operation` is called with a different set of arguments, it will not compute anything again but just return the cached value.
C) The `cache` decorator does not handle keyword arguments or default parameters correctly.
D) The `functools.wraps` is used to preserve the identity of the original function.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `cache` decorator will always store and retrieve results based on argument values.
This statement is correct. The `cache` decorator uses a dictionary to store results based on the arguments with which the decorated function is called. If the same arguments are passed again, it retrieves the result from the cache instead of recomputing it.

B) Incorrect. While the `cache` decorator does remember and return cached results for the same arguments, it will recompute and cache new results if different arguments are provided.

C) The `cache` decorator currently only handles positional arguments. It would need to be modified to handle keyword arguments or default parameters correctly.

D) Correct. The `functools.wraps` decorator is used to preserve the metadata of the original function, such as its name and docstring, after it has been decorated. This ensures that introspection on the decorated function behaves correctly.
