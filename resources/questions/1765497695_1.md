    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to dynamically add a method to all classes inheriting from `BaseClass`. Your task is to identify what will be printed when the `main` function is executed.

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: "Dynamic Method Called"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    pass

def main():
    obj = DerivedClass()
    print(obj.dynamic_method())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

A) AttributeError: 'DerivedClass' object has no attribute 'dynamic_method'
B) Dynamic Method Called
C) TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class DerivedClass with abstract methods dynamic_method
D) NameError: name 'dynamic_method' is not defined
    
    ## Answer
    [B] Dynamic Method Called

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` dynamically adds a method `dynamic_method` to all classes inheriting from `BaseClass`. 
- Since `DerivedClass` inherits from `BaseClass`, it gains the `dynamic_method`.
- When an instance of `DerivedClass` is created and its `dynamic_method` is called, it executes as intended, printing "Dynamic Method Called".
