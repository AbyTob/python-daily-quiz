    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses asyncio for asynchronous tasks:

```python
import asyncio

async def task(name, delay):
    print(f"Task {name} started")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Task {name} finished")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task('A', 1), task('B', 2), task('C', 3))

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and output of this code?

A) The tasks will execute in sequence, with 'A' finishing before 'B' and 'C'.
B) All tasks start at the same time, and 'B' finishes after 2 seconds.
C) The tasks run concurrently, and all three finish within about 3 seconds.
D) An error will occur because asyncio.sleep is not used correctly.

Part 2 (Answer):
C) The tasks run concurrently, and all three finish within about 3 seconds.

Explanation:
The `asyncio.gather` function is used to run multiple coroutines concurrently. In this example, 'A', 'B', and 'C' start at the same time, and each task has a different sleep duration. Task 'A' sleeps for 1 second, 'B' for 2 seconds, and 'C' for 3 seconds. Since they are running concurrently, all three tasks will complete within about 3 seconds after the `main` function is called with `asyncio.run(main())`.
