    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet which uses a metaclass to dynamically add an attribute to a class:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_attr'] = 'I am dynamic'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.dynamic_attr)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) When `MyClass` is instantiated, it raises an error because 'dynamic_attr' does not exist.
B) The value of `dynamic_attr` can be changed after creating instances of `MyClass`.
C) Instances of `MyClass` cannot access the attribute 'dynamic_attr'.
D) The metaclass adds 'dynamic_attr' to the class before any instance is created.
    
    ## Answer
    [D] The metaclass adds 'dynamic_attr' to the class before any instance is created.
