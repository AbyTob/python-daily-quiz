# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['default_value'] = 42
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class MyClass:
    pass

def create_instance(cls):
    instance = cls()
    return instance.default_value
```

What will be the output of `create_instance(MyClass)`?

A) 10  
B) 24  
C) 42  
D) An error is raised
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is C) 42.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` is defined to add a class attribute `default_value` with the value 42 during class creation.
- When `create_instance(MyClass)` is called, it creates an instance of `MyClass`.
- Since `MyClass` was created by the metaclass `Meta`, it has the `default_value` attribute set to 42.
- Therefore, calling `instance.default_value` returns 42.

This question tests the understanding of how metaclasses can be used to modify class behavior during creation and highlights the importance of following class inheritance chains when accessing attributes.
