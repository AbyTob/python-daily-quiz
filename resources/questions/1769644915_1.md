    ## Answer
    Part 1 (Question): Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to measure execution time:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(1, n+1))

# Run the function
result = compute_sum(1000000)
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when `compute_sum` is called with an argument of 1000000?

A) The decorator prints the time taken to execute `compute_sum`, and then returns the sum from 1 to 1000000.
B) The decorator calculates the sum but does not print any execution time.
C) The function execution is slowed down by the decorator, making it take longer than usual.
D) The decorator fails to run, causing a runtime error.

Part 2 (Answer): A) The decorator prints the time taken to execute `compute_sum`, and then returns the sum from 1 to 1000000.

Explanation: The `timing_decorator` is defined to measure and print the execution time of any function it decorates. When `@timing_decorator` is used on `compute_sum`, calling `compute_sum(1000000)` will first execute the `wrapper` function, which starts a timer before and after calling `compute_sum`. It then prints the execution time and returns the result of `compute_sum`. Therefore, both the sum and the execution time are correctly computed and printed.
