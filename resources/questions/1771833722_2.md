    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to modify the behavior of a function. The decorator should add a prefix "Hello, " before each call's output.

```python
def hello_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Add your code here to prepend "Hello, "
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@hello_decorator
def greet(name):
    return f"World, {name}!"

# Example usage:
print(greet("Alice"))  # Expected output: "Hello, World, Alice!"
```

What modification should be added to the `wrapper` function inside `hello_decorator` to achieve the desired behavior?

A) `result = func(*args, **kwargs)`
   `return f"Hello, {result}"`

B) `output = func(*args, **kwargs)`
   `return "Hello, " + output`

C) `result = func(*args, **kwargs)`
   `return "Hello, " + result`

D) `print("Hello, ", end='')`
   `func(*args, **kwargs)`
    
    ## Answer
    B) `output = func(*args, **kwargs)`
   `return "Hello, " + output`

Explanation: The correct answer is B. In the `wrapper` function of the decorator, we need to call the original function `func` with its arguments (`*args, **kwargs`) and store its return value in a variable called `output`. Then, we concatenate `"Hello, "` before this output and return the modified string. Answer A incorrectly tries to return "Hello," concatenated directly with the result of the function call without storing it first. Answer C attempts to return "Hello," concatenated with `result`, but it doesn't correctly capture the function's output. Answer D prints "Hello, " but does not return anything, which would cause a `NoneType` error when called as a decorator on a function.
