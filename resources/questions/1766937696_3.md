    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to dynamically add a method to a class:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: "Hello from dynamic method!"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.dynamic_method())
```

What will the output of this code be when executed?

A) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'dynamic_method'
B) TypeError: 'type' object is not callable
C) "Hello from dynamic method!"
D) 0
    
    ## Answer
    C) "Hello from dynamic method!"

Explanation:
The metaclass `Meta` is defined to dynamically add a method named `dynamic_method` to any class that uses it as its metaclass. In this case, `MyClass` uses `Meta` as its metaclass, so the `dynamic_method` is added to `MyClass`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and `dynamic_method()` is called on it, the output will be "Hello from dynamic method!".
