    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {self.func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

class ComputeSumTimer(Timer):
    def __init__(self, n):
        super().__init__(compute_sum)
        self.n = n

    def __call__(self):
        return super().__call__(self.n)

# Usage
result = ComputeSumTimer(1000000)()
```

Which of the following statements about the provided code is true?

A) The `@timer` decorator is used correctly to measure the execution time of functions.
B) The `ComputeSumTimer` class inherits from both `Timer` and `compute_sum`.
C) When creating an instance of `ComputeSumTimer`, it immediately computes the sum.
D) The execution time measurement in the `Timer` class uses a context manager.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `@timer` decorator is used correctly to measure the execution time of functions.

Explanation: 
- Statement A is correct. The `@timer` decorator, when applied to any function, will print the execution time.
- Statement B is incorrect because `ComputeSumTimer` does not inherit from `compute_sum`. It only takes `compute_sum` as a callable in its constructor and then calls it within its `__call__` method.
- Statement C is incorrect. The `ComputeSumTimer` instance must be called to execute the function and measure its time, i.e., `result = ComputeSumTimer(1000000)()`.
- Statement D is incorrect. The code does not use a context manager for timing; it uses a decorator and a custom class with a callable method to achieve the same result.
