    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that demonstrates a custom metaclass designed to count the number of instances created by classes derived from it:

```python
class InstanceCounter(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        super().__init__(name, bases, dct)
        cls._instances = 0

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        cls._instances += 1
        return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceCounter):
    pass

# Creating instances of MyClass
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

# Checking the count of instances
print(MyClass._instances)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the above code?

A) When `obj1` and `obj2` are created, their class (`MyClass`) will have a `_instances` attribute set to 2.
B) The metaclass `InstanceCounter` does not track any instances because it only increments a static variable.
C) The `_instances` attribute is stored in each instance of `MyClass`.
D) The code raises an error when trying to create instances of `MyClass`.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
A) When `obj1` and `obj2` are created, their class (`MyClass`) will have a `_instances` attribute set to 2.

**Explanation:** In the provided code, the metaclass `InstanceCounter` overrides the `__call__` method. This method is called whenever an instance of `MyClass` (or any other class derived from it) is created. Inside this overridden method, `_instances` is incremented each time a new instance is created, thus correctly tracking the number of instances. The attribute `_instances` is not stored in each instance but rather in the class itself (`MyClass._instances`). Therefore, after creating two instances of `MyClass`, the value of `MyClass._instances` will be 2, confirming that statement A is true and options B, C, and D are incorrect.
