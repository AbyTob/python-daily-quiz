    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to enforce certain constraints on class attributes:

```python
class MetaConstraint(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr, value in dct.items():
            if not isinstance(value, int):
                raise ValueError(f"Attribute {attr} must be an integer")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=MetaConstraint):
    x = 10
    y = "not_an_int"
```

When you try to create an instance of `MyClass`, what will happen?

A) An instance of `MyClass` will be created with `x = 10` and `y = "not_an_int"`.

B) A `ValueError` will be raised because the attribute `y` is not an integer.

C) The metaclass will ignore the constraint since it's a class attribute, not an instance attribute.

D) An `AttributeError` will be raised when trying to access `y`.
    
    ## Answer
    [B] A `ValueError` will be raised because the attribute `y` is not an integer.

Explanation: In Python, metaclasses allow for customizing class creation. The `MetaConstraint` metaclass checks that all attributes defined in any subclass are integers. Since `MyClass` contains a non-integer attribute (`y = "not_an_int"`), attempting to create an instance of `MyClass` will trigger the metaclass's error handling, raising a `ValueError`.
