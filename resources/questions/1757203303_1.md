# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure that all instances of a class have an attribute `created_at` set to the current timestamp when they are created:

```python
from datetime import datetime

class TimestampMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'created_at' not in dct:
            dct['created_at'] = property(lambda self: datetime.now())
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=TimestampMeta):
    pass

instance = MyClass()
```

Which of the following statements is true about the above code?

A) The `MyClass` instances will not have a `created_at` attribute.
B) The `created_at` property will always return the timestamp when the class was defined.
C) Each `MyClass` instance will have a unique `created_at` attribute set to the time of its creation.
D) The metaclass `TimestampMeta` is incorrectly implemented and will cause an error.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
C) Each `MyClass` instance will have a unique `created_at` attribute set to the time of its creation.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `TimestampMeta` dynamically adds a property named `created_at` to any class it decorates.
- This property uses a lambda function that, when called, returns the current timestamp using `datetime.now()`.
- Each time an instance of `MyClass` is created, a new `created_at` attribute is set with the timestamp at that moment.
- Therefore, each instance will have its own unique timestamp, making option C correct.
