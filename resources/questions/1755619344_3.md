    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question): 

**Question:**
Consider the following code that uses a metaclass to add a class method to any class it decorates. The goal is to create a utility for adding logging functionality to methods, but there's an issue with how the metaclass and the logging function are interacting.

```python
import functools

class LogMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = cls._log_method(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def _log_method(method):
        @functools.wraps(method)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Calling {method.__name__} with args: {args[1:]}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
            return method(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

class MyClass(metaclass=LogMeta):
    def my_method(self, a, b):
        return a + b

# Usage
my_instance = MyClass()
result = my_instance.my_method(3, 4)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Options:**
A) The code will log the method call with its arguments and print the result.

B) The `LogMeta` metaclass fails to apply the logging functionality correctly because `functools.wraps` is not used on the wrapper function.

C) The `_log_method` static method incorrectly applies the decorator, leading to a recursion error.

D) There's no issue with the code and it will work as expected without any changes.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The provided code is almost correct but has a subtle issue. The `LogMeta` metaclass correctly replaces each callable method in the class dictionary with a wrapped version that logs the arguments and then calls the original method. However, there's no explicit call to `super().__new__()` at the end of the `__new__` method inside `LogMeta`. This can lead to unexpected behavior if other metaclasses are involved or if additional base classes have their own metaclass implementations.

To fix this issue and ensure that the metaclass behaves as expected, you should include a call to `super().__new__()` at the end of the `__new__` method within the `LogMeta` class. This will properly create the new class type with the updated dictionary, ensuring that all methods are correctly wrapped.

Once this is corrected, the code will log the method calls as expected and print the result when `my_instance.my_method(3, 4)` is called.
