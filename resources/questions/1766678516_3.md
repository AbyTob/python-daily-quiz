    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

@AsyncDecorator
async def compute_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i
    return total

import asyncio

# Example usage:
asyncio.run(compute_sum(10))
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `compute_sum` function is a coroutine and can be called with `await`.
B) The `AsyncDecorator` class ensures that any method it decorates will be run asynchronously.
C) The `AsyncDecorator` class must be used in conjunction with the `@asyncio.coroutine` decorator to work properly.
D) The `compute_sum` function is not a coroutine and cannot be awaited.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `compute_sum` function is a coroutine and can be called with `await`.

Explanation: In the provided code, `AsyncDecorator` is designed to convert any synchronous function into an asynchronous one by wrapping it in another async function. This transformation allows `compute_sum` to be used with `await`, enabling its execution within an asyncio event loop. Options B and C are incorrect because they imply additional decorators or methods that are not present in the provided code. Option D is false because, as a coroutine, `compute_sum` can indeed be awaited.
