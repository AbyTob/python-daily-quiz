    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to track all instances of a class:

```python
class TrackerMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        cls._instances[instance] = True
        return instance

class MyClass(metaclass=TrackerMeta):
    pass

a = MyClass()
b = MyClass()

print(len(TrackerMeta._instances))
```

What will be the output of this code?

A) 0  
B) 1  
C) 2  
D) TypeError
    
    ## Answer
    C) 2  

**Explanation**:  
When `MyClass` is instantiated, the `__call__` method of its metaclass `TrackerMeta` is invoked. This method creates a new instance of the class and stores it in `_instances`. Each time an instance of `MyClass` is created (`a = MyClass()` and `b = MyClass()`), a new entry is added to `_instances`. Therefore, after creating two instances, the length of `_instances` will be 2.
