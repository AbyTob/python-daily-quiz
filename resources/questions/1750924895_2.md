    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a decorator which logs function calls with their arguments:

```python
import functools

def log_function_call(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__}({args}, {kwargs})")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@log_function_call
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(3, 4))
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The decorator will correctly log the function calls as expected.

B) The decorator will cause a runtime error because `functools.wraps` is not used.

C) The decorator will work but the logged arguments will be incorrect due to how `*args` and `**kwargs` are handled.

D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    A) The decorator will correctly log the function calls as expected.

Explanation: This statement is true. The `functools.wraps` decorator is used correctly to preserve the metadata of the original function, including its name, docstring, and other attributes. Therefore, when the `add` function is called with arguments `(3, 4)`, it will print "Calling add((3, 4), {})" as expected. The use of `*args` and `**kwargs` in both the wrapper and the original function ensures that all positional and keyword arguments are correctly passed through.
