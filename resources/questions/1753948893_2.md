    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes inheriting from it:

```python
class MethodAdder(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['extra_method'] = lambda self: 'New method added!'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=MethodAdder):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.extra_method())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the behavior of this code when executed?

A) The `extra_method` will not be added to `MyClass`.
B) The `extra_method` will print 'New method added!' when called.
C) It will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot add methods.
D) None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `extra_method` will print 'New method added!' when called.

Explanation: 
When you define a metaclass and override its `__new__` method, this method is responsible for creating new class objects. In the provided code, the `MethodAdder` metaclass adds an `extra_method` lambda function to the dictionary of any class that uses it as a metaclass. Therefore, when we create an instance of `MyClass`, it has access to the `extra_method` and calling it will produce the expected output 'New method added!'.
