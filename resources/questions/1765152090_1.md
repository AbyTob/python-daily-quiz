    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add an attribute to any class it decorates:

```python
class AddAttributeMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['added_attribute'] = 'This is an added attribute'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddAttributeMeta):
    pass

instance = MyClass()
print(instance.added_attribute)
```

What will be printed when the above code is executed?

A) `TypeError: __new__() takes exactly 3 arguments (4 given)`

B) `This is an added attribute`

C) `'added_attribute' is not defined`

D) The program will crash

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) `This is an added attribute`

Explanation:
The code defines a metaclass `AddAttributeMeta` that adds an attribute named `added_attribute` with the value `"This is an added attribute"` to any class it decorates. When `MyClass` is defined with this metaclass, `addition_attribute` is automatically added to instances of `MyClass`. Thus, when you print `instance.added_attribute`, it correctly outputs `"This is an added attribute"`.
