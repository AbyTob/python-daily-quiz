    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncAdder:
    def __init__(self, base):
        self.base = base

    async def add(self, value):
        return self.base + value

async def main():
    adder = AsyncAdder(10)
    result = await asyncio.gather(
        adder.add(5),
        adder.add(3),
        adder.add(2)
    )
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `AsyncAdder` class uses synchronous methods internally.
B) The `asyncio.gather` function will wait for all tasks to complete before printing the results.
C) The code contains a race condition due to concurrent access to the `base` attribute.
D) Running this script multiple times will always produce the same output.
    
    ## Answer
    D) Running this script multiple times will always produce the same output.

Explanation: In Python's asyncio, tasks are scheduled and executed by an event loop. The `asyncio.gather` function waits for all the tasks to complete before proceeding, which means it ensures that all asynchronous operations have finished executing before printing the results. Since the calculations in this code do not depend on any mutable state or external factors that could change between runs, the output will always be consistent and match the expected result of `[15, 13, 12]`.
