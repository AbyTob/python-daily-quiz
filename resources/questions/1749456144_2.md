    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses a combination of metaclasses, decorators, and context managers:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class ThreadSafeSingleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    @property
    def data_size(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def add_data(self, key, value):
        self.data[key] = value

class DataAdder:
    def __enter__(self, instance: ThreadSafeSingleton):
        self.instance = instance
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        with self.lock:
            self.instance.add_data('temp', 10)
        return self.instance

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        with self.lock:
            del self.instance.data['temp']

def add_data_to_singleton():
    instance = ThreadSafeSingleton()
    with DataAdder(instance) as singleton:
        print(singleton.data_size)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    add_data_to_singleton()
```

What is the output of this script? Explain how the use of metaclasses, decorators, and context managers contributes to thread safety in this example.

A) 0  
B) 1  
C) 2  
D) Error
    
    ## Answer
    B) 1  

The output of this script will be `1`. The use of metaclasses (`SingletonMeta`) ensures that the `ThreadSafeSingleton` class is a singleton, meaning only one instance of it can exist. The decorator pattern is not directly used in this example but could be applied to add additional functionality if needed.

Context managers (`DataAdder`) are crucial for managing resources like locks to ensure thread safety when accessing shared data. In this case, the lock prevents multiple threads from entering the `with` block at the same time, ensuring that the data modification is thread-safe.

The `ThreadSafeSingleton` class itself uses a dictionary (`data`) to store data, and the `add_data_to_singleton` function demonstrates how to use the singleton instance within a context manager. The lock ensures that when the 'temp' key is added, it does not interfere with any other thread attempting to access or modify the same key concurrently.

Therefore, after executing the script, the size of the data dictionary will be `1`, indicating that one item has been successfully added through the context manager while maintaining thread safety.
