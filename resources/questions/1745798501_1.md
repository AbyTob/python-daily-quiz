    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes dynamically:

```python
class AddMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['add_method'] = lambda self, x: x + 5
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddMethodMeta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.add_method(10))  # Output?
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.

B) The output will be an error because `add_method` is not defined in `MyClass`.

C) The output will be `None` because metaclasses do not affect method definitions.

D) The code will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot add methods dynamically.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**A) The output will be `15` because `add_method` adds 5 to its argument.**

This is the correct answer. In Python, metaclasses allow you to customize class creation by modifying or extending the class definition before it's finalized. In this case, the `AddMethodMeta` metaclass dynamically adds a method named `add_method` to any class it's applied to. When we create an instance of `MyClass`, it gains access to this new method, which simply returns its argument incremented by 5.

The line `print(obj.add_method(10))` will therefore output `15`.
