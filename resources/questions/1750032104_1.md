    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a decorator to measure execution time:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

result = compute_sum(1000000)
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `timer` decorator will not affect the execution time of the `compute_sum` function.
B) When `compute_sum` is called with an argument, it executes synchronously and the decorator measures its execution time accurately.
C) The `wrapper` function inside `timer` does not modify any of the arguments passed to `func`.
D) The `result` variable will hold the value `None`, as the decorator does not return the result of `compute_sum`.
    
    ## Answer
    B) When `compute_sum` is called with an argument, it executes synchronously and the decorator measures its execution time accurately.

Explanation:
- The `timer` decorator wraps the `compute_sum` function. It captures the start time before calling `func`, computes the sum, and then records the end time to calculate the duration. This allows the decorator to measure the actual execution time of `compute_sum`.
- The decorator does not modify the arguments passed to `func`; it merely uses them as is.
- The `result` variable will hold the value returned by `compute_sum`, which is `sum(range(n))`.
