# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    __metaclass__ = type
    
    @my_decorator
    def my_method(self):
        print("This method is decorated.")

obj = MyClass()
obj.my_method()
```

What happens when you create an instance of `MyClass` and call its `my_method`? Explain the role of decorators in this scenario.

A) The output will be: "Something is happening before the function is called." followed by "This method is decorated."

B) The output will be: "This method is decorated." followed by "Something is happening before the function is called."

C) The code raises an error because `my_decorator` cannot be applied to instance methods.

D) The code creates a new class with the same name and methods but does not execute any print statements.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The output will be: "Something is happening before the function is called." followed by "This method is decorated."

Explanation:
The decorator `my_decorator` wraps the instance method `my_method`. When an instance of `MyClass` calls `my_method`, it goes through the decorator first. This means that "Something is happening before the function is called." is printed, and then the original method's implementation runs, printing "This method is decorated." Thus, option A correctly reflects the behavior of the code.
