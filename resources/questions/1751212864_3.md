    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following code snippet that utilizes a metaclass and class decoration to modify behavior dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['hello'] = 'world'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class MyClass:
    pass

def greet(cls):
    print(f"Hello from {cls.__name__}!")
    return cls

greet(MyClass)
```

What will be printed when the `greet` function is called with `MyClass` as its argument?

A) Hello from MyClass!
B) world
C) Error: 'hello' attribute not defined in MyClass
D) None
