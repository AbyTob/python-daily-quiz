    ## Question
    Part 1: Question

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add a method to a class dynamically:

```python
# Define a metaclass that adds a 'greet' method to any class it decorates
class AddGreetMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f"Hello, I am {self.name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Use the metaclass to create a class with dynamic method
class Person(metaclass=AddGreetMeta):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

# Create an instance of Person and call the dynamically added method
person = Person("Alice")
print(person.greet())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `Person` class will raise a `TypeError` when instantiated because it does not define the `greet` method.
B) When `Person("Alice")` is called, an error occurs because metaclasses cannot dynamically add methods after a class has been created.
C) The output of `print(person.greet())` will be "Hello, I am Alice".
D) The `AddGreetMeta` metaclass must be used with inheritance to work properly.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2: Answer

C) The output of `print(person.greet())` will be "Hello, I am Alice".

Explanation:

In Python, metaclasses allow for the customization of class creation. By using a metaclass (`AddGreetMeta`) and defining its `__new__` method, we can dynamically add methods to any class being created. In this example, the `greet` method is added to the `Person` class when it is instantiated. Therefore, when calling `person.greet()`, the output will be "Hello, I am Alice". The metaclass works during class creation, not at instance creation or after the class has been fully defined and used.
