    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a decorator and a metaclass together to modify class behavior. The goal is to ensure that any method defined in a subclass of `Base` is automatically converted to asynchronous if it contains the word "async" anywhere in its docstring.

```python
def async_if_docstring_contains_async(func):
    if 'async' in func.__doc__:
        return asyncio.coroutine(func)
    return func

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr, value in dct.items():
            if callable(value) and isinstance(value, property):
                setattr(dct, attr, property(async_if_docstring_contains_async(value.fget)))
            else:
                setattr(dct, attr, async_if_docstring_contains_async(value))
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Base(metaclass=Meta):
    def method_with_async_in_docstring(self):
        """
        This is an asynchronous method.
        """
        pass

# Subclassing Base
class Derived(Base):
    async def method_without_async_in_docstring(self):
        """This is a regular method."""
        pass
```

Which of the following statements accurately describes what happens when `Derived` class methods are called?

A) Both `method_with_async_in_docstring` and `method_without_async_in_docstring` will raise a `TypeError`.

B) Only `method_without_async_in_docstring` will be treated as an asynchronous method.

C) Neither `method_with_async_in_docstring` nor `method_without_async_in_docstring` will be treated as asynchronous methods.

D) `method_with_async_in_docstring` will be automatically converted to an asynchronous method, while `method_without_async_in_docstring` remains unchanged.
    
    ## Answer
    [D] `method_with_async_in_docstring` will be automatically converted to an asynchronous method, while `method_without_async_in_docstring` remains unchanged.

**Explanation:**  
The decorator `async_if_docstring_contains_async` checks if the docstring of a function contains the word "async". If it does, the function is decorated with `asyncio.coroutine`, which converts it into an asynchronous function. In the given code, the subclass `Derived` inherits from `Base`. Since `method_with_async_in_docstring` has a docstring containing "async", it will be converted to an asynchronous method when it is accessed via an instance of `Derived`. On the other hand, `method_without_async_in_docstring`, even though it's defined as an async method in the class definition, does not have the required word "async" in its docstring. Therefore, the decorator does not affect it, and it remains a regular asynchronous method when called.
