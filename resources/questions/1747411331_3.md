    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching data from {url}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Data for {url}"

class DataLoader:
    def __init__(self, urls):
        self.urls = urls
    
    async def load_all(self):
        tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in self.urls]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        print("All data fetched")
        return results

urls = ["http://example.com", "http://example.org"]
data_loader = DataLoader(urls)

async def main():
    data = await data_loader.load_all()
    print(data)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `DataLoader` class can only fetch data from one URL at a time.
B) All `fetch_data` calls are made sequentially, waiting for each to complete before starting the next.
C) The use of `asyncio.gather` allows all `fetch_data` calls to run concurrently, significantly speeding up the fetching process.
D) There is no error handling mechanism in place if a URL fails to fetch data.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
C) The use of `asyncio.gather` allows all `fetch_data` calls to run concurrently, significantly speeding up the fetching process.

Explanation:
- **Option A and B** are incorrect because the code uses `asyncio.gather`, which runs all tasks concurrently. Each task (each call to `fetch_data`) is scheduled and started immediately after the previous one, but they don't wait for each other. Therefore, multiple URLs' data can be fetched at the same time.
- **Option C** is correct as `asyncio.gather` takes an iterable of coroutines (`tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in self.urls]`) and schedules them to run concurrently. This results in all `fetch_data` calls starting almost immediately and finishing in parallel, which can significantly reduce the total time needed to fetch data from multiple URLs.
- **Option D** is not addressed in the provided code. While it's generally a good practice to include error handling when dealing with network requests or external services, this specific question does not touch upon that aspect of the code.
