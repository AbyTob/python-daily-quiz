# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses decorators to measure the execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_primes(n):
    primes = []
    for possiblePrime in range(2, n + 1):
        isPrime = True
        for num in range(2, int(possiblePrime ** 0.5) + 1):
            if possiblePrime % num == 0:
                isPrime = False
        if isPrime:
            primes.append(possiblePrime)
    return primes

print(compute_primes(1000))
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `timer` decorator will not affect the performance of the `compute_primes` function significantly.

B) The `timer` decorator modifies the behavior of `compute_primes` by adding timing functionality without altering its original logic.

C) Using decorators like `@timer` can lead to significant overhead and is generally discouraged for performance-critical applications.

D) The `compute_primes` function will execute faster when decorated with `@timer`.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The `timer` decorator modifies the behavior of `compute_primes` by adding timing functionality without altering its original logic.

Explanation:
- Decorators in Python are a powerful tool for modifying or enhancing functions. In this case, the `timer` decorator adds functionality to measure and print the execution time of `compute_primes` without changing the function's core purpose.
- The decorator wraps the original function (`func`) inside a new function (`wrapper`). This allows the wrapper to add the timing logic (measuring start and end times) before and after calling the original function, respectively.
- While decorators can introduce some overhead due to the extra function calls, in this case, the performance impact on `compute_primes` is minimal. For small functions like `compute_primes`, the time taken by the decorator itself is negligible compared to the actual computation.
- Therefore, using decorators like `@timer` does not significantly affect the performance of `compute_primes` and can be a useful tool for debugging or monitoring without altering the original function's logic.
