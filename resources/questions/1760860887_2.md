    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that attempts to implement a thread-safe counter using decorators:

```python
import threading

def synchronized(func):
    lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0
    
    @synchronized
    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1
    
    @synchronized
    def decrement(self):
        self.value -= 1
    
    @synchronized
    def get_value(self):
        return self.value
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `@synchronized` decorator ensures that all operations on instances of `Counter` are thread-safe.

B) The `lock` in the `wrapper` function will be created each time the decorated method is called.

C) Using `threading.Lock()` guarantees that only one thread can execute any method in `Counter` at a given time.

D) There is no need for the `@synchronized` decorator as Python's global interpreter lock (GIL) prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously.
