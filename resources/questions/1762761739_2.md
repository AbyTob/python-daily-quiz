**Question:**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to automatically add a `__str__` method to any class it decorates, which returns the string representation of the class name:

```python
class AutoStrMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['__str__'] = lambda self: f"<{self.__class__.__name__}>"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AutoStrMeta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj)
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will have a custom `__str__` method that returns its class name.

B) The metaclass `AutoStrMeta` adds a `__str__` method to `MyClass`, and every subclass of `MyClass` will also inherit this method.

C) The code will raise an error because `__str__` is being redefined, which leads to a conflict with Python's internal string representation mechanism.

D) The `__str__` method defined in the metaclass will not work as intended because it uses a lambda function that captures the class name at the time of creation.

**Answer:**

B) The metaclass `AutoStrMeta` adds a `__str__` method to `MyClass`, and every subclass of `MyClass` will also inherit this method.

**Explanation:**
- Option A is incorrect because while an instance of `MyClass` does have the custom `__str__` method, it does not explicitly return its class name; rather, it returns a generic string like `<AutoStrMeta>`.
- Option B is correct. The metaclass `AutoStrMeta` dynamically adds a `__str__` method to any class it decorates, which means that all subclasses of `MyClass` will also have this method.
- Option C is incorrect because there is no conflict with Python's internal string representation mechanism; the custom `__str__` method does not interfere with how Python handles object printing by default.
- Option D is incorrect. The lambda function captures the class name at the time of creation, so each subclass will have its own version of the `__str__` method that reflects its actual class name when called.

This question tests the understanding of metaclass functionality and how it affects class inheritance.
