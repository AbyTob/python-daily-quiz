    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to measure execution time:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    total = sum(range(n))
    return total

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_sum(1000000)
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `compute_sum` function will execute in less than 1 second on any modern computer.

B) The decorator `timer` adds functionality to measure execution time without altering the behavior of `compute_sum`.

C) If `timer` were used as a metaclass instead, it would still be able to decorate functions normally because decorators and metaclasses are fundamentally different in how they operate.

D) Using a context manager within `wrapper` could allow for more precise timing by managing resources like file handles or database connections.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The decorator `timer` adds functionality to measure execution time without altering the behavior of `compute_sum`.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because the exact time it takes for a function to execute can vary widely based on many factors, including system load and other processes running concurrently. It's not guaranteed to be less than 1 second even on modern computers.
- Option B is correct. A decorator like `timer` wraps the original function (`compute_sum`) with additional functionality (measuring time) without changing its core behavior.
- Option C is incorrect. Decorators and metaclasses operate at different levels of Python's object model. Decorators modify functions by wrapping them, while metaclasses modify classes by intercepting class creation.
- Option D is incorrect. While context managers can be useful for managing resources in a controlled way, they are not suitable for measuring execution time as they primarily handle cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing locks.

This question tests the candidate's understanding of decorators and how they work to enhance functions without altering their core logic, which is an advanced Python concept.
