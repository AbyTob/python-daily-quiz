    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following code snippet that uses a decorator to log the execution time of a function:

```python
import time

def log_execution_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_execution_time
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))

# Compute the sum of numbers from 1 to 1000
result = compute_sum(1000)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior of the `compute_sum` function when it is called with an argument of 1000?

A) The function will output "compute_sum executed in x.yz seconds" where x.yz represents the time taken to compute the sum.
B) The decorator `log_execution_time` will not be applied because it is not imported.
C) The function `compute_sum` will raise an error because it is decorated with a non-callable object.
D) The execution time of the function will not be logged due to improper use of decorators.
    
    ## Answer
    [A]  
The decorator `log_execution_time` correctly logs the execution time of the `compute_sum` function when it is called. When you run this code, it will output a line indicating how long the computation took, confirming that the decorator has been applied and is working as expected.
