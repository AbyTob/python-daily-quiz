    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that demonstrates a decorator for logging method calls. Your task is to enhance this decorator with an additional feature: it should also track the execution time of each method call.

```python
import time

def log_and_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    @log_and_time
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(1)

    @log_and_time
    def method2(self, x):
        return sum(i for i in range(x))
```

Which of the following modifications would allow the `log_and_time` decorator to track both the execution time and log the arguments passed to each method call?

A) Modify the `wrapper` function to include a print statement that logs the arguments.

B) Create a new decorator that combines functionality of `log_and_time` with an argument logging feature, then apply this new decorator to `MyClass`.

C) Directly modify the `func.__name__` inside the `wrapper` to include the method arguments in its string representation.

D) None of the above. The current implementation cannot be modified to track both execution time and method arguments.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) Create a new decorator that combines functionality of `log_and_time` with an argument logging feature, then apply this new decorator to `MyClass`.

Explanation: 
The correct approach is to create a new decorator that logs both the execution time and the arguments passed to each method. This can be achieved by creating a decorator that captures the original function's signature, and then defining a wrapper inside it that logs the arguments before calling the original function. Here's how you could implement such a decorator:

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_and_time_with_args(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        arg_list = [repr(a) for a in args] + [f"{k}={v!r}" for k, v in kwargs.items()]
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__}({', '.join(arg_list)}) took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    @log_and_time_with_args
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(1)

    @log_and_time_with_args
    def method2(self, x):
        return sum(i for i in range(x))
```

This new decorator, `log_and_time_with_args`, will print both the execution time and the arguments passed to each method call when they are invoked.
