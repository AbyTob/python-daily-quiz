    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure that all subclasses of `Base` have at least one method named `required_method`. If any subclass does not implement this method, an error should be raised during class creation.

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'required_method' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Subclasses must define the 'required_method'")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Base(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Define a subclass that implements the required method
class Derived(Base):
    def required_method(self):
        print("Method implemented")

# Define another subclass that does not implement the required method
class MissingMethodSubclass(Base):
    pass  # This should raise an error during class creation
```

What will happen when `MissingMethodSubclass` is defined? Provide a brief explanation of why.

A) The code will run without errors, and `MissingMethodSubclass` will be created.
B) A `TypeError` will be raised because the subclass does not define the `required_method`.
C) The metaclass will automatically generate the `required_method` in `MissingMethodSubclass`.
D) An error will occur during runtime when an instance of `MissingMethodSubclass` is created.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) A `TypeError` will be raised because the subclass does not define the `required_method`.

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` enforces that any subclass of `Base` must implement a method named `required_method`. When trying to define `MissingMethodSubclass`, the metaclass checks if this method is present in the dictionary defining the class. Since it is not, a `TypeError` is raised during the class creation process, preventing the subclass from being defined. This enforces a design pattern where certain methods must be implemented by all subclasses of `Base`.
