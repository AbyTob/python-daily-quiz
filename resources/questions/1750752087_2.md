    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to enforce a class attribute:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'name' not in dct:
            raise AttributeError("Class must have a 'name' attribute")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Person(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# This will raise an AttributeError
person = Person()

# Correct way to instantiate the class
class Student(Person):
    name = "John"

student = Student()
```

Which of the following statements correctly explains what happens when `Person()` is called?

A) It successfully creates an instance of `Person` because it inherits from a base class that defines the necessary attribute.
B) It raises an AttributeError because the metaclass enforces the presence of a 'name' attribute, which is missing in the `Person` class.
C) It returns `None` because no attribute enforcement happens due to some internal Python behavior.
D) It raises a TypeError because metaclasses cannot be applied directly to instance creation.
    
    ## Answer
    B) It raises an AttributeError because the metaclass enforces the presence of a 'name' attribute, which is missing in the `Person` class.
