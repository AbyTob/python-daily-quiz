    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses metaclasses to ensure a class has a method with a specific signature:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'my_method' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Class must have a 'my_method'")
        method = dct['my_method']
        if not callable(method) or len(inspect.signature(method).parameters) != 1:
            raise TypeError("Method 'my_method' must be callable with one parameter")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def my_method(self, x):
        pass
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the `MyClass` class?

A) The class will raise an error because it does not have a method named `my_method`.  
B) The class will be successfully created as it conforms to the metaclass requirements.  
C) The class creation will fail due to a missing implementation in `my_method`.  
D) The class will be created with `my_method` but without any type checking.
    
    ## Answer
    [B]  
The metaclass `Meta` checks that the class has a method named `my_method` and that this method is callable with exactly one parameter. Since `MyClass` correctly defines such a method, it passes the metaclass check and is successfully created.
