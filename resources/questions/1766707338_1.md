    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that attempts to use a decorator to measure the execution time of functions. However, it does not work as expected:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end - start} seconds")
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        sum += i
    return sum

result = compute_sum(1000000)
print(result)
```

Which of the following statements correctly explains why the `compute_sum` function does not print its execution time?

A) The decorator is not applied because `compute_sum` has a return value.

B) The `wrapper` function does not capture the return value of `func`.

C) The decorator is not thread-safe, so it cannot accurately measure time in multi-threaded environments.

D) The timing measurement is too coarse and cannot provide accurate results for small functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The `wrapper` function does not capture the return value of `func`.

Explanation: The issue with this code lies in the fact that the `wrapper` function does not return anything. When a function is decorated, it needs to explicitly pass along any return values from the original function to avoid disrupting normal function behavior. The correct decorator should look like this:

```python
def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end - start} seconds")
        return result  # This line is missing in the original code.
    return wrapper
```

By adding `return result` at the end of the `wrapper`, we ensure that the decorator correctly passes through any return value from the original function, allowing it to be printed when called.
