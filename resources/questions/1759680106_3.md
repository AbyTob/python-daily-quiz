    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that aims to create a simple asynchronous server using asyncio:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncServer:
    def __init__(self, port):
        self.port = port
        self.server = None

    async def start(self):
        self.server = await asyncio.start_server(self.handle_client, '127.0.0.1', self.port)
        addr = self.server.sockets[0].getsockname()
        print(f'Serving on {addr}')

        async with self.server:
            await self.server.serve_forever()

    async def handle_client(self, reader, writer):
        data = await reader.read(100)
        message = data.decode().strip()
        addr = writer.get_extra_info('peername')

        print(f"Received {message} from {addr}")

        response = f'Echo: {message}'
        writer.write(response.encode())
        await writer.drain()

        print("Closing the connection")
        writer.close()

# Usage
server = AsyncServer(8888)
asyncio.run(server.start())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the above code?

A) The server will run indefinitely until manually stopped.
B) The `handle_client` method runs in parallel for each client connection using threads.
C) Each client's request is processed sequentially in a single thread.
D) The use of asyncio ensures that the entire program can handle multiple clients simultaneously without blocking.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The server will run indefinitely until manually stopped.

This is true because `await self.server.serve_forever()` keeps the event loop running, allowing the server to continuously accept new connections and handle them asynchronously.
