# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses decorators and metaclasses:

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = my_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def method(self):
        print("Method is called.")

# Usage
instance = MyClass()
instance.method()
```

What will be the output when `instance.method()` is called? Why?

A) Something is happening before the function is called. Method is called. Something is happening after the function is called.

B) Something is happening before the function is called. Method is called. Something is happening after the function is called. Method is called.

C) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'method'

D) TypeError: method() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Something is happening before the function is called. Method is called. Something is happening after the function is called.

Explanation:
- The `Meta` metaclass is used to automatically decorate all callable attributes of any class that uses this metaclass with `my_decorator`.
- When `instance.method()` is called, it triggers the decorator, which first prints "Something is happening before the function is called.", then calls the original method, and finally prints "Something is happening after the function is called.".
- The output confirms that the decorator wraps the original method call correctly.
