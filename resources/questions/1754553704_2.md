    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
    
    async def increment(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        self.count += 1
        return self.count

async def main():
    counter = AsyncCounter()
    
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(counter.increment())
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(counter.increment())

    result = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this code when executed?

A) [0, 0]  
B) [1, 1]  
C) [0, 1]  
D) [1, 2]
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B) [1, 1].

Explanation:

- The `AsyncCounter` class has an `increment` method that increments a counter after simulating some asynchronous work with `asyncio.sleep(1)`.
- In the `main` function, two tasks (`task1` and `task2`) are created to run the `increment` method concurrently.
- Since both tasks start almost immediately and their sleep times overlap only briefly (due to the short duration of `await asyncio.sleep(1)`), both tasks will successfully complete before the main coroutine finishes.
- The final count after both tasks have completed is 2, but each task individually returns its own value of the counter. Therefore, the output `[1, 1]` reflects that each task returned the same count (the last value set by `self.count`) before it was incremented again.
