    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that attempts to use a metaclass for creating a singleton class:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

a = MyClass()
b = MyClass()

print(a is b)  # Expected output: True
```

However, the code does not work as expected due to a common mistake in implementing singletons. Identify and correct this mistake.

A) The `__call__` method should return a dictionary instead of an instance.
B) The `_instances` dictionary should be defined in the metaclass itself rather than per-instance.
C) The `Singleton` class should inherit from `object`.
D) The `super(Singleton, cls)` call should be replaced with `super()`.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `__call__` method should return a dictionary instead of an instance.

Explanation: In the given code, `cls._instances` is incorrectly being used as if it were an attribute of each class instance. However, `_instances` should be a class variable (i.e., defined in the metaclass itself), not an instance variable. The correct implementation would look like this:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

a = MyClass()
b = MyClass()

print(a is b)  # Correct output: True
```

By correcting this mistake, the `MyClass` instances are properly managed as a singleton.
