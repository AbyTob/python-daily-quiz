    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

**Question:**
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching data from {url}")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate a network request
    return f"Data for {url}"

async def main():
    urls = ["http://example.com", "http://example.org", "http://example.net"]
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the execution of this code?

A. The `fetch_data` function runs synchronously and blocks the event loop.

B. The `asyncio.sleep(2)` inside `fetch_data` blocks the entire program, not just a single task.

C. The tasks are run concurrently, and all data fetches complete within approximately 2 seconds.

D. The `main` function must be called with `asyncio.run(main())` to ensure it runs as an asynchronous program.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**Answer:**

C. The tasks are run concurrently, and all data fetches complete within approximately 2 seconds.

**Detailed Explanation:**
The code snippet provided uses the `asyncio` library to perform concurrent task execution. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why option C is correct:

1. **Asynchronous Tasks**: Each call to `fetch_data(url)` creates an asynchronous task that runs concurrently with other tasks. This is done using list comprehension to generate a list of tasks.

2. **Concurrency**: The line `results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)` gathers all the results as soon as they are completed, regardless of when each individual task finishes. Since there are three tasks and each takes 2 seconds, the total time taken for all tasks to complete is 2 seconds (assuming no I/O contention).

The other options can be ruled out:
- **A**: `fetch_data` is defined with `async def`, making it an asynchronous function that runs within the event loop, not synchronously.
- **B**: The `await asyncio.sleep(2)` statement does not block the entire program; it suspends the current task (i.e., the `fetch_data` coroutine) for 2 seconds and allows other tasks to run in the meantime.
- **D**: While calling `main()` directly with `main()` would work, it would not take advantage of asyncio's capabilities. The correct way to run an asynchronous program is by using `asyncio.run(main())`, which manages event loop execution and proper cleanup.

This question tests the understanding of basic asyncio concepts, task creation, and concurrency.
