    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a new attribute to all instances of a class dynamically:

```python
class AddAttribute(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['new_attribute'] = 'added'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddAttribute):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.new_attribute)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `__new__` method of the metaclass is not called when creating an instance of `MyClass`.

B) When you create an instance of `MyClass`, the `new_attribute` is added to the class itself, not to the instances.

C) The value of `new_attribute` will be 'added' for all instances of `MyClass`.

D) The `metaclass=AddAttribute` argument in the class definition is redundant because it's set to a built-in type `type`.

### Part 2 (Answer)
C) The value of `new_attribute` will be 'added' for all instances of `MyClass`.

**Explanation:**
The metaclass `AddAttribute` is correctly implemented. It modifies the dictionary of each class it defines by adding the key-value pair `'new_attribute': 'added'`. Therefore, when an instance of `MyClass` is created, this new attribute is added to the instance, and its value will be 'added'.
