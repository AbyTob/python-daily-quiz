**Part 1:**

Implement a context manager that measures the execution time of any block of code within its `with` statement. Your context manager should print the start, end, and total time taken for the execution.

Here's a template to get you started:

```python
import time

class ExecutionTimer:
    def __enter__(self):
        # Code to run when entering the with block
        pass
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        # Code to run when exiting the with block
        pass

# Example usage:
with ExecutionTimer():
    time.sleep(2)
```

Which of the following options correctly completes the `ExecutionTimer` context manager?

A) 
```python
def __enter__(self):
    self.start = time.time()
    
def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
    end = time.time()
    print(f"Start: {self.start}, End: {end}, Total Time: {end - self.start}")
```

B) 
```python
def __enter__(self):
    self.start = time.perf_counter()
    
def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
    end = time.perf_counter()
    print(f"Start: {self.start}, End: {end}, Total Time: {end - self.start}")
```

C) 
```python
def __enter__(self):
    self.start = time.process_time()
    
def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
    end = time.process_time()
    print(f"Start: {self.start}, End: {end}, Total Time: {end - self.start}")
```

D) 
```python
def __enter__(self):
    self.start = time.time_ns()
    
def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
    end = time.time_ns()
    print(f"Start: {self.start}, End: {end}, Total Time: {end - self.start}")
```

**Part 2:**

B) 

Explanation:
The correct answer is B. The `time.perf_counter()` function provides the highest resolution timer available on the system, and it should be used for measuring short durations with high precision. This makes it ideal for accurately timing code execution in a context manager.
