# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass and decorators:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'greet' not in dct:
            raise TypeError(f"{name} must define a 'greet' method.")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def greet_decorator(cls):
    original_greet = cls.greet
    def new_greet(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Hello from decorator!")
        return original_greet(self, *args, **kwargs)
    cls.greet = new_greet
    return cls

@greet_decorator
class Person(metaclass=Meta):
    def greet(self):
        print("Hi!")

# Usage
p = Person()
p.greet()
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `Meta` metaclass ensures that any subclass of `Person` must implement a `greet` method.

B) The `greet_decorator` adds a greeting message "Hello from decorator!" before the original `greet` method, but does not modify the behavior of subclasses.

C) The `Person` class will raise an error when instantiated because it does not define a `greet` method.

D) The `Meta` metaclass and `greet_decorator` together ensure that every subclass of `Person` prints "Hello from decorator!" before calling its own `greet` method.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)
**A) The `Meta` metaclass ensures that any subclass of `Person` must implement a `greet` method.**

This statement is correct because the `Meta` metaclass checks if the `greet` method exists in the dictionary of any subclass being created. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.

**Explanation:**
- The `Meta` class overrides the `__new__` method to enforce that every subclass must have a `greet` method.
- When you try to create an instance of `Person`, Python will call the `Meta` metaclass's `__new__` method, which checks for the presence of the `greet` method. Since `Person` implements this method, no error is raised.

The other options are incorrect because:
B) The decorator does add a message before calling the original greet method, but it also modifies the behavior of subclasses by changing their `greet` method.
C) No error occurs when creating an instance of `Person` because the `Meta` metaclass ensures that the necessary method exists.
D) While both the metaclass and the decorator are used in this example, they perform different roles. The metaclass checks for the presence of a required method, while the decorator adds functionality to existing methods.
