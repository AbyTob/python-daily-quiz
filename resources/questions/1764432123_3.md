    ## Question
    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, duration):
        self.duration = duration
        self.start_time = None

    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        elapsed_time = time.time() - self.start_time
        print(f"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds")

async def main():
    async with Timer(5):
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
        await asyncio.sleep(3)

# Run the main function in an event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the output of this code, and why?

A) It will print "Elapsed time: 0.0 seconds"

B) It will print "Elapsed time: 5.0 seconds"

C) It will print "Elapsed time: 7.0 seconds"

D) It will raise a TypeError

**Part 2: Answer**

C) It will print "Elapsed time: 7.0 seconds"

Explanation:
The `Timer` class is designed to measure the time it takes to execute the code within its context manager. When you use `async with Timer(5):`, it starts a new `Timer` instance and calls its `__aenter__` method, which records the start time. The `main()` function then awaits two `asyncio.sleep()` calls, each of which sleeps for 2 and 3 seconds respectively. Since these sleep operations are asynchronous, they do not block the event loop, allowing other tasks to run concurrently (though in this case, there's only one other task, the timer). When the context manager exits, its `__aexit__` method is called, which calculates the elapsed time by subtracting the start time from the current time and prints it. Since the total sleep time is 2 + 3 = 5 seconds, the printed output will be "Elapsed time: 7.0 seconds". This reflects the actual execution time of the two sleep operations, as measured by the `Timer` class.
