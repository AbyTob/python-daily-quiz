    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to implement a custom metaclass to ensure all instances of a class have unique identifiers:

```python
class UniqueMeta(type):
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instances is None:
            cls._instances = {}
        instance_id = id(args)
        if instance_id in cls._instances:
            raise ValueError(f"Duplicate instance with id {instance_id}")
        cls._instances[instance_id] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[instance_id]

class UniqueClass(metaclass=UniqueMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Attempt to create instances of UniqueClass
a = UniqueClass(10)
b = UniqueClass(20)

# Try creating a duplicate instance with the same args
try:
    c = UniqueClass(10)  # This should raise an exception
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

What is the intended behavior of this code, and what does it actually do when `c = UniqueClass(10)` is executed?

A) It correctly raises a ValueError because an instance with those arguments already exists.

B) It successfully creates another instance and prints its value.

C) It throws a TypeError because `_instances` is not initialized in the metaclass.

D) It enters an infinite loop due to recursive instantiation.
    
    ## Answer
    A) It correctly raises a ValueError because an instance with those arguments already exists.

Explanation: The intention of the `UniqueMeta` metaclass is to ensure that no two instances of classes using this metaclass are created with the same arguments. However, in this implementation, `_instances` is not initialized in the metaclass itself. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access or set `_instances`. To fix this, you would need to initialize `_instances` in the `__init__` method of the metaclass:

```python
class UniqueMeta(type):
    _instances = {}  # Initialize here

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance_id = id(args)
        if instance_id in cls._instances:
            raise ValueError(f"Duplicate instance with id {instance_id}")
        cls._instances[instance_id] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[instance_id]
```

With this correction, `c = UniqueClass(10)` will indeed raise a ValueError as expected, demonstrating that the metaclass is functioning correctly in its intended purpose.
