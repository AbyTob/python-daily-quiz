    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to any class it decorates:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MethodAdderMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['add_method'] = lambda self, value: setattr(self, 'new_attr', value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(metaclass=MethodAdderMeta):
    pass

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    pass
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior of this code?

A) `DerivedClass` will have a method named `add_method`, but it won't be callable.
B) Instances of `DerivedClass` can call `add_method` to add an attribute, and this attribute will be accessible through `new_attr`.
C) The metaclass does not work as intended because it only modifies the `BaseClass`.
D) The code will raise a `TypeError` when trying to define `DerivedClass`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) Instances of `DerivedClass` can call `add_method` to add an attribute, and this attribute will be accessible through `new_attr`.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `MethodAdderMeta` is used to dynamically add a method `add_method` to any class that uses it as its metaclass.
- This method allows adding new attributes to instances of the decorated class.
- Therefore, when you create an instance of `DerivedClass`, you can call `instance.add_method(value)` and then access this value through the attribute `new_attr`.
