    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that aims to create a context manager which ensures that any exception is logged before re-raising it. However, there are several issues in this implementation:

```python
import logging

class ExceptionLogger:
    def __init__(self, logger_name):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(logger_name)

    async def __aenter__(self):
        # TODO: Implement this method
        pass

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if exc_type is not None:
            self.logger.error(f"Exception occurred: {exc_val}", exc_info=(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb))
        return False  # Propagate the exception

async def risky_function():
    raise ValueError("Something went wrong")

async def main():
    async with ExceptionLogger('my_logger') as logger:
        await risky_function()

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

What issues does the current implementation have, and how can they be fixed?

A) The `__aenter__` method is not implemented correctly.
B) The context manager will not log exceptions properly due to missing logging setup.
C) There is no proper handling of asynchronous resources.
D) All issues mentioned are correct.
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer: B)

Explanation:
The current implementation has several issues, but the primary one affecting its functionality is that it does not set up a logger. The `logging` module should be configured before using it to ensure that messages are logged correctly. Additionally, for an asynchronous context manager, proper handling of asynchronous resources is necessary if any were involved in managing exceptions.

To fix these issues, you need to ensure that the logging configuration is done before creating an instance of `ExceptionLogger`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)

class ExceptionLogger:
    def __init__(self, logger_name):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(logger_name)

    async def __aenter__(self):
        return self  # Not necessary for this context manager but included for completeness

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if exc_type is not None:
            self.logger.error(f"Exception occurred: {exc_val}", exc_info=(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb))
        return False  # Propagate the exception

async def risky_function():
    raise ValueError("Something went wrong")

async def main():
    async with ExceptionLogger('my_logger') as logger:
        await risky_function()

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

This version includes a basic logging configuration and correct implementation of the `__aenter__` method, which is not strictly necessary for this context manager but is included for completeness.
