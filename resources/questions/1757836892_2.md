    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data"

class AsyncWrapper:
    async def __call__(self, func):
        result = await func()
        return f"Wrapped: {result}"

async def main():
    wrapper = AsyncWrapper()
    data = await wrapper(fetch_data())
    print(data)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `AsyncWrapper` class can be used as a decorator to wrap any synchronous function.  
B) The `fetch_data` function will not execute asynchronously when passed to the `AsyncWrapper`.  
C) The `main` function will print "Wrapped: Data" after approximately 1 second.  
D) The `AsyncWrapper` class requires manual invocation of the wrapped function.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The `main` function will print "Wrapped: Data" after approximately 1 second.

Explanation: The `AsyncWrapper` class is designed to wrap an asynchronous function and return a string prefixed with "Wrapped: ". When `fetch_data()` is passed to `wrapper`, it awaits the execution of `fetch_data()` and then adds the prefix, resulting in the printed output. Since `fetch_data()` sleeps for 1 second, the total time taken by the program will also be approximately 1 second, including the small overhead of wrapping.
