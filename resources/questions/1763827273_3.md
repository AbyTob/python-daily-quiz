    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses both decorators and metaclasses to modify class behavior:

```python
def add_method(cls):
    def new_method(self):
        return "New method called!"
    cls.new_method = new_method
    return cls

class Meta(type):
    @add_method
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class MyClass:
    pass

def test():
    obj = MyClass()
    print(obj.new_method())

test()
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `add_method` decorator adds a new method to all classes decorated with it.
B) The metaclass `Meta` overrides the class creation process, adding a new method to `MyClass`.
C) Both A and B are correct.
D) Neither A nor B is correct.
    
    ## Answer
    B
