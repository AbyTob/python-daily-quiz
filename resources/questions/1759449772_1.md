    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
You are developing a web application that requires efficient handling of database connections. You decide to implement a connection pool that uses context managers to manage the lifecycle of each connection. The goal is to ensure that all connections are properly closed after use, even if an error occurs during their execution.

Implement a `ConnectionPool` class using a context manager. The class should allow for the creation and management of multiple database connections. When entering the context manager, it should return a connection from the pool, and when exiting, it should ensure that the connection is returned to the pool or closed if an error occurs.

Here's a partial implementation:
```python
class ConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self, max_connections):
        self.max_connections = max_connections
        self.pool = []

    def get_connection(self):
        # Implement this method to return a connection from the pool
        pass

    def release_connection(self, conn):
        # Implement this method to release a connection back to the pool
        pass

    def __enter__(self):
        if len(self.pool) == 0:
            raise ValueError("No available connections in the pool")
        return self.get_connection()

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        # Implement this method to handle the exit of the context manager
        pass

# Example usage:
pool = ConnectionPool(5)
with pool as conn:
    result = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
```

Which of the following options correctly completes the `ConnectionPool` class?

A) 
```python
def get_connection(self):
    return self.pool.pop()

def release_connection(self, conn):
    self.pool.append(conn)

def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    if exc_type is not None:
        raise exc_value
```

B) 
```python
def get_connection(self):
    return self.pool.pop() if self.pool else self.create_new_connection()

def release_connection(self, conn):
    self.pool.append(conn)

def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    if exc_type is None:
        self.release_connection()
```

C) 
```python
def get_connection(self):
    return self.pool.pop()

def release_connection(self, conn):
    self.pool.append(conn)

def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    if exc_type is not None:
        self.release_connection()
    else:
        raise exc_value
```

D) 
```python
def get_connection(self):
    return self.pool.pop() if self.pool else None

def release_connection(self, conn):
    self.pool.append(conn)

def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    if exc_type is not None:
        self.release_connection()
```
    
    ## Answer
    D) 
```python
def get_connection(self):
    return self.pool.pop() if self.pool else None

def release_connection(self, conn):
    self.pool.append(conn)

def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    if exc_type is not None:
        self.release_connection()
```

This option correctly handles the creation of new connections when none are available and ensures that connections are always returned to the pool or closed properly upon exiting the context manager.
