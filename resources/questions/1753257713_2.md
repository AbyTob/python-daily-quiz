# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question): 
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to any class it decorates:

```python
class AddMethod(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['new_method'] = lambda self: 'New Method'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@AddMethod
class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()
```

What does calling `obj.new_method()` do? Explain why and provide the output.

A) It raises an AttributeError because new_method is not defined in MyClass  
B) It returns 'New Method' because AddMethod adds the method dynamically at class creation time  
C) It throws a TypeError because new_method expects arguments  
D) It outputs the memory address of obj.new_method
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer): 
The correct answer is B: It returns 'New Method' because AddMethod adds the method dynamically at class creation time.

Explanation: The `AddMethod` metaclass defines a `__new__` method that takes three parameters: the metaclass itself (`cls`), the name of the new class (`name`), and a dictionary representing the namespace of the class (`dct`). Inside the `__new__` method, a lambda function is added to the `dct` under the key 'new_method'. This lambda function returns the string 'New Method' when called. Since this method is added during the creation of any class that uses `AddMethod`, it becomes available on instances of those classes as well.

Option A is incorrect because 'new_method' has been added to the class, so calling `obj.new_method()` will not raise an AttributeError.
Option C is incorrect because there are no arguments required for the lambda function we added.
Option D is incorrect because calling a method does not return its memory address; it executes the code and returns the result if any.
