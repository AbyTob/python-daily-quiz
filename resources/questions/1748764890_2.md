    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'run' in dct:
            dct['run'] = timer(dct['run'])
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Timer(metaclass=TimerMeta):
    def run(self):
        time.sleep(2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = Timer()
    t.run()
```

What will be the output of this code when executed?

A) The program will hang indefinitely.
B) "Function run took 0.0000 seconds to execute." will be printed followed by a hang.
C) "Function run took 2.0000 seconds to execute." will be printed followed by a hang.
D) An error will occur because the metaclass and decorator do not work together.
