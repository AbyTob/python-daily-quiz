    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class with a custom attribute:

```python
class CustomMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['custom_attr'] = 'Hello, Metaclass!'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=CustomMeta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.custom_attr)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior of this code?

A) It will raise a `TypeError` because metaclasses cannot be used with regular classes.
B) It will output 'Hello, Metaclass!' when run.
C) The class `MyClass` will not have any attributes or methods defined in it.
D) It will result in a runtime error due to improper usage of the metaclass.
    
    ## Answer
    B) It will output 'Hello, Metaclass!' when run.

Explanation:
- A metaclass is a class that defines how a class behaves. In this case, `CustomMeta` is used to create `MyClass`, and it successfully adds the attribute `custom_attr` with the value 'Hello, Metaclass!' to `MyClass`.
- When an instance of `MyClass` is created (`obj = MyClass()`), and we access `obj.custom_attr`, it retrieves the custom attribute set by the metaclass, which outputs 'Hello, Metaclass!'.
- Therefore, option B is correct as it accurately describes the output of running this code.
