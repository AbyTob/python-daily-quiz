# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to the database...")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: ?
```

What will be printed when you run this code? Explain why.

A. True  
B. False  
C. Error  
D. None
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A. True  

Explanation:
The correct answer is True, meaning that `db1` and `db2` are indeed the same instance of the `Database` class. This is because the metaclass `SingletonMeta` ensures that only one instance of any class derived from it is created, no matter how many times the class is instantiated. In this case, both `db1` and `db2` refer to the same singleton instance, so their identity (`is`) will return True.
