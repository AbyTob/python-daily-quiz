    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a decorator that can be applied to any function to measure its execution time. However, this decorator should also work seamlessly when used with asyncio coroutines, without altering their behavior. Implement the `time_it_async` decorator that measures the execution time of both regular functions and asyncio coroutines.

Example usage:
```python
@time_it_async
def sync_function():
    time.sleep(1)

@time_it_async
async def async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

Which of the following implementations correctly achieves the desired behavior?
