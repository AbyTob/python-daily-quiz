# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):  
Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to modify class behavior:

```python
def add_method(cls):
    def new_method(self):
        return "New method added!"
    cls.new_method = new_method
    return cls

@add_method
class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.new_method())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The decorator `add_method` does not change the behavior of `MyClass`.
B) The output of the program will be "New method added!".
C) The decorator `add_method` changes the class definition at runtime, adding a new method to it.
D) The code will raise an error because decorators cannot modify classes in this way.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):  
C) The decorator `add_method` changes the class definition at runtime, adding a new method to it.

Explanation:  
The decorator `add_method` is applied to the class `MyClass`. Inside the decorator, a new method named `new_method` is defined and then assigned to the class `cls`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and its `new_method` is called, it executes the newly added method, which returns "New method added!". This demonstrates how decorators can be used dynamically to modify classes and their behaviors at runtime.
