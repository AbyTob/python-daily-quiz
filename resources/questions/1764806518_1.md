    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
class Singleton:
    _instances = {}

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Logger(metaclass=Singleton):
    def log(self, message):
        print(f"Log: {message}")

def logger_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        logger.log(f"Calling function {func.__name__} with args {args} and kwargs {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@logger_decorator
class DatabaseConnection:
    @staticmethod
    def connect():
        print("Connecting to database...")

# Usage
db1 = Logger()
db2 = Logger()

print(db1 is db2)  # A. True B. False
DatabaseConnection.connect()  # C. Logs "Calling function connect with args () and kwargs {}" followed by "Connecting to database..."
```

Which of the following statements about the provided code is true?

A. `db1` and `db2` are different instances of the `Logger` class.
B. The output of calling `DatabaseConnection.connect()` includes a log message indicating the function call.
C. Both A and B are correct.
D. Neither A nor B are correct.
    
    ## Answer
    C. Both A and B are correct.

Explanation: 
- The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of the `Logger` class is created, so `db1` and `db2` refer to the same instance. This means `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`.
- The `logger_decorator` logs a message before calling the decorated method. Therefore, when `DatabaseConnection.connect()` is called, it logs "Calling function connect with args () and kwargs {}" followed by "Connecting to database...".
