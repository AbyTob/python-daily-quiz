    ## Question
    ### Part 1: Question

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a custom class with a specific behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Add a new method 'greet' to any subclass using this metaclass
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class AnotherClass(Meta, MyClass):
    pass
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `greet` method will be added to both `MyClass` and `AnotherClass`, but not to any subclass of `AnotherClass`.

B) The `greet` method will be added only to `MyClass` and not to `AnotherClass` or any subclasses.

C) The `greet` method will be added to all classes that inherit from `AnotherClass`, including `MyClass`.

D) The `greet` method will be added to `MyClass` but not to `AnotherClass`, unless explicitly defined in `AnotherClass`.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2: Answer

A) The `greet` method will be added to both `MyClass` and `AnotherClass`, but not to any subclass of `AnotherClass`.

Explanation:
- In Python, metaclasses are used to create classes, and they can modify the class being created. In this case, the `Meta` metaclass adds a `greet` method to any class that uses it as their metaclass.
- When `MyClass` is defined with `metaclass=Meta`, the metaclass `Meta` modifies `MyClass` by adding the `greet` method.
- Similarly, when `AnotherClass` inherits from both `Meta` and `MyClass`, it also inherits the `greet` method because `MyClass` already has it due to being modified by `Meta`.
- However, any subclass of `AnotherClass` will not have the `greet` method unless explicitly defined in that subclass. This is because `AnotherClass` does not inherit from a metaclass that adds `greet`, only from `MyClass`.
