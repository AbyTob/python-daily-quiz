    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

# Example usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(obj1 is obj2)  # What will this print?
```

What will be the output of `print(obj1 is obj2)`?

A. `False`
B. `True`
C. An error
D. `None`
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer:** B. `True`

**Explanation:**

The code provided defines a metaclass `Singleton` that ensures only one instance of the class it decorates is created, regardless of how many times the class is instantiated. In this case, `MyClass` is decorated with `Singleton`. 

When you create an instance of `MyClass`, like so:
- `obj1 = MyClass()`
- `obj2 = MyClass()`

Both `obj1` and `obj2` will reference the same instance because the metaclass `Singleton` checks if an instance already exists in its `_instances` dictionary. If it does, it returns that existing instance; otherwise, it creates a new one.

Thus, `obj1 is obj2` evaluates to `True`, indicating that both variables point to the same object in memory.
