    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

class Singleton:
    _instance = None
    _lock = threading.Lock()

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instance is None:
            with cls._lock:
                if cls._instance is None:
                    cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

    def do_something(self):
        print("Doing something")

# Create two threads
def thread_function():
    singleton_instance = Singleton()
    singleton_instance.do_something()

thread1 = threading.Thread(target=thread_function)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=thread_function)

# Start the threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for both threads to finish
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

# Check if they share the same instance
print(f"Thread 1 instance: {id(thread1._target._args[0])}")
print(f"Thread 2 instance: {id(thread2._target._args[0])}")
```

What will be printed to the console when the code is executed?

A) Both threads print "Doing something" and both have different singleton instances.

B) Both threads print "Doing something" and both use the same singleton instance.

C) The output depends on the order in which the threads finish execution.

D) An error occurs because accessing `_target` of a thread object is not allowed.
    
    ## Answer
    B) Both threads print "Doing something" and both use the same singleton instance.

Explanation:
The `Singleton` class uses the `__new__` method with a lock to ensure that only one instance of the class is created, even in a multi-threaded environment. The `_lock` ensures that if multiple threads attempt to create an instance simultaneously, only one will succeed, and all subsequent attempts will return the same instance. Therefore, when both threads call `Singleton()`, they receive the same instance of the class.
