    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval

    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Elapsed time: {end_time - self.start_time} seconds")
        await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)

async def main():
    async with AsyncTimer(1) as timer:
        await asyncio.sleep(2)

# Uncomment the line below to run the code
# asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the `AsyncTimer` class and its usage in the `main` function?

A. The `AsyncTimer` class implements a context manager that measures elapsed time.
B. The `AsyncTimer` class uses threading to handle asynchronous operations.
C. The `AsyncTimer` class does not correctly measure the elapsed time due to an error in the `__aenter__` method.
D. When run, the `main` function will output "Elapsed time: 2 seconds".
    
    ## Answer
    A. The `AsyncTimer` class implements a context manager that measures elapsed time.

Explanation:
- The `AsyncTimer` class is defined to be used as an asynchronous context manager with the `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods.
- In the `__aenter__`, it records the start time of the timer.
- In the `__aexit__`, it calculates the elapsed time by subtracting the start time from the current time and prints it. This is done asynchronously using `await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)`.
- The usage in `main` correctly demonstrates how to use an asynchronous context manager with `async with`. When run, it will indeed output "Elapsed time: 2 seconds" because the total execution time of the block inside `async with` (which includes the 2-second sleep call) is approximately 3 seconds, but the print statement is delayed by the interval specified in the `AsyncTimer` constructor.
