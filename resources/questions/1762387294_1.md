    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code using asyncio:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print("Start fetching")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Data fetched")
    return {'data': 'fake data'}

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data())
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Main function is running...")
    result = await task
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this program when run?

A) Start fetching  
   Main function is running...  
   Data fetched  
   {'data': 'fake data'}

B) Main function is running...  
   Start fetching  
   Data fetched  
   {'data': 'fake data'}

C) Start fetching  
   Data fetched  
   {'data': 'fake data'}  

D) Error: Task is already done
    
    ## Answer
    A) Start fetching  
   Main function is running...  
   Data fetched  
   {'data': 'fake data'}

**Explanation**: The `await asyncio.sleep(1)` in the main function allows other tasks to run during this time, including the `fetch_data` coroutine. However, because the task was created but not awaited properly until after the sleep, it completes before the print statement inside the main function that fetches and prints the result.
