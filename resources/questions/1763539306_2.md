    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'abstract_method' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Abstract method is missing")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Base(metaclass=Meta):
    @abstractmethod
    def abstract_method(self):
        pass

class Concrete(Base):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    
    def abstract_method(self):
        print(f"Value is {self.value}")

# Create an instance of Concrete and call the abstract method
c = Concrete(10)
c.abstract_method()
```

What will be printed to the console when running this code?

A) TypeError: Abstract method is missing  
B) Value is 10  
C) NameError: name 'c' is not defined  
D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    B) Value is 10  

**Explanation:**  
In Python, abstract methods are part of an abstract base class (ABC) and must be implemented by any subclass that doesn't declare them as abstract itself. In this example, `Concrete` correctly implements the `abstract_method`, which prints "Value is {self.value}". When you create an instance of `Concrete` with `c = Concrete(10)` and call `c.abstract_method()`, it will output "Value is 10". The metaclass `Meta` ensures that any subclass of `Base` (except for abstract base classes) must implement the `abstract_method`.
