    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet which uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of the `Singleton` class can be created.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Usage
instance1 = Singleton()
instance2 = Singleton()

print(instance1 is instance2)  # Output: True
```

Which of the following statements correctly explains why this metaclass ensures that only one instance of `Singleton` can be created?

A. The `__call__` method checks if an instance already exists in `_instances`. If it does, it returns the existing instance; otherwise, it creates a new one.

B. The metaclass uses class attributes to store instances. Each time the `Singleton` class is instantiated, it first checks if an instance exists for that class and returns it if found.

C. The metaclass modifies the `__init__` method of the `Singleton` class to prevent additional instantiation after the first one.

D. The metaclass defines a private constructor using `__new__`, ensuring only one instance can be created.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A. The `__call__` method checks if an instance already exists in `_instances`. If it does, it returns the existing instance; otherwise, it creates a new one.

Explanation: This statement is correct because the `SingletonMeta` metaclass overrides the `__call__` method, which is invoked when an instance of `Singleton` is created. The method checks if an instance already exists in `_instances`. If it does not exist, it creates a new instance using `super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)` and stores it in `_instances`. Any subsequent attempts to create an instance will return the already stored instance, thus ensuring that only one instance of `Singleton` is created.
