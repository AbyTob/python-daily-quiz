    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):  
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def my_async_function(x):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return x * 2

async def main():
    tasks = []
    for i in range(5):
        task = asyncio.create_task(my_async_function(i))
        tasks.append(task)
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

# Uncomment the line below to run the code
# asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?  
A) The `my_async_function` will always return values in ascending order.  
B) The execution time of `main` function is exactly 5 seconds due to the sequential execution of tasks.  
C) Using `asyncio.gather` allows concurrent execution of all `my_async_function` tasks, reducing the overall execution time significantly compared to option B.  
D) If you comment out `await asyncio.sleep(1)` inside `my_async_function`, the code will still run correctly and perform faster.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):  
C) Using `asyncio.gather` allows concurrent execution of all `my_async_function` tasks, reducing the overall execution time significantly compared to option B.  

Explanation:  
- The correct answer is C because `asyncio.gather` runs all tasks concurrently, which means they are scheduled and executed as soon as a free slot in the event loop appears. This significantly reduces the total execution time compared to waiting for each task sequentially (option A) or blocking the entire thread while waiting for the sleep (option B).  
- Option A is incorrect because although `asyncio.sleep` is used, it does not guarantee that tasks will complete in ascending order. Their order of completion depends on when they finish, which can be randomized due to concurrent execution.  
- Option B is incorrect because, with concurrency provided by `asyncio.gather`, the total execution time should be around 1 second (the duration of one `await asyncio.sleep(1)`), not exactly 5 seconds. Each task runs concurrently and completes in about a second.  
- Option D is incorrect because if you comment out `await asyncio.sleep(1)`, each `my_async_function(i)` will return immediately with the value of `i * 2`, but this does not affect the concurrency or execution time improvement provided by `asyncio.gather`.
