    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses both a metaclass and a class decorator:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'decorated' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Class must be decorated")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def class_decorator(cls):
    cls.decorated = True
    return cls

@class_decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

try:
    class UndecoratedClass(metaclass=Meta):
        pass
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```

1. What will happen when `UndecoratedClass` is defined?
2. Which of the following statements correctly describes the role of `Meta` in this scenario?

A) It enforces that all classes decorated with `class_decorator` must have a class variable named 'decorated'.
B) It ensures that `MyClass` has an attribute called 'decorated' set to True.
C) It raises an error if any class is defined without being decorated, regardless of the decorator used.
D) It checks that all classes using it as their metaclass have a method named 'decorated'.

### Part 2 (Answer)

A) It enforces that all classes decorated with `class_decorator` must have a class variable named 'decorated'.
Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks if the `decorated` attribute is present in the class dictionary during class creation. If it's not found, it raises a `TypeError`. Only `MyClass`, which is decorated with `@class_decorator`, has this attribute set.

B) It ensures that `MyClass` has an attribute called 'decorated' set to True.
Explanation: This is incorrect because the metaclass itself checks for the presence of the `decorated` attribute, not the class decorator. The actual setting happens in the `class_decorator`.

C) It raises an error if any class is defined without being decorated, regardless of the decorator used.
Explanation: This is also incorrect. The metaclass only enforces this rule if it is explicitly used with a decorator that sets the `decorated` attribute.

D) It checks that all classes using it as their metaclass have a method named 'decorated'.
Explanation: Incorrect. The check for the presence of a method does not apply in this scenario; it's checking for a class variable.
