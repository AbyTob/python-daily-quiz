    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.start_time = None

    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Timer '{self.name}' took {end_time - self.start_time:.4f} seconds.")

def timed_function(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with Timer(func.__name__):
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return result
    return wrapper

@timed_function
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

# Usage of the compute_sum function
result = compute_sum(1000000)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

Which statement is true regarding the above code?

A) The `Timer` class is a metaclass and does not support context management.

B) The `timed_function` decorator measures the execution time of any function it decorates.

C) Using `@timed_function`, the execution time of `compute_sum(1000000)` will be printed before its result.

D) The `Timer` class uses a descriptor for its context management functionality.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
B) The `timed_function` decorator measures the execution time of any function it decorates.

Explanation:
- The `Timer` class is not a metaclass but a simple context manager that prints the time taken by the block of code inside its `with` statement.
- The `timed_function` decorator correctly wraps any function to measure and print its execution time. It uses Python's built-in timing functions from the `time` module to calculate the duration and prints it after the decorated function completes.
- The `Timer` class indeed supports context management using the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, which are used in the example with the `with Timer('compute_sum'):` statement.
- Descriptors are not involved in the implementation of context management or decorators as shown in this code.
