    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Timer {self.name}: {end_time - self.start_time:.4f} seconds")

with Timer("Example"):
    time.sleep(2)
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and limitations of this context manager?

A) The context manager measures the execution time of the block it manages but does not handle any exceptions.

B) The context manager can be used to measure the execution time of multiple blocks by creating instances for each block.

C) Using the `Timer` class as a context manager will prevent Python from printing any other console output during its block.

D) The execution time is always accurately measured down to microseconds due to the use of the high-resolution timer in Python.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The context manager measures the execution time of the block it manages but does not handle any exceptions.

Explanation: 
- The Timer class correctly implements a context manager using `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
- It can indeed be used to measure multiple blocks separately by creating instances for each block. However, this is not reflected in option B as it incorrectly states that all output during the block execution will be suppressed, which is not true.

Option A is correct because:
- The context manager measures the time accurately and prints the duration.
- Exceptions raised within the context are propagated outside of it without being caught or handled by the `Timer` class.

Options C and D are incorrect because:
- Option C is false; other console output is not suppressed during the block execution. 
- Option D is also incorrect as Python's `time.time()` does not provide microsecond resolution in all systems, but usually provides millisecond precision depending on the system's clock.
