    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a thread-safe counter using decorators and metaclasses:

```python
from threading import Lock

class ThreadSafeCounterMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        for attr_name in dir(attrs):
            if isinstance(attrs[attr_name], callable):
                attrs[attr_name] = cls.add_lock(attrs[attr_name])
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

    @staticmethod
    def add_lock(func):
        lock = Lock()
        
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            with lock:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

class ThreadSafeCounter(metaclass=ThreadSafeCounterMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self._value = 0
    
    def increment(self):
        self._value += 1
    
    def decrement(self):
        self._value -= 1
    
    def get_value(self):
        return self._value

# Usage
counter = ThreadSafeCounter()
print(counter.get_value())
```

What issue exists in the above code, and how can it be fixed to ensure thread safety?

A) The `add_lock` decorator does not correctly bind the method to the class instance.
B) The `lock` variable is defined within the decorator, causing it to have limited scope.
C) The metaclass is incorrectly used as a base class for `ThreadSafeCounter`.
D) The methods are not properly decorated with the `add_lock` function.
    
    ## Answer
    [D] The methods are not properly decorated with the `add_lock` function.

Explanation:
The provided code attempts to make all callable attributes thread-safe using a metaclass. However, in Python, class methods (like `increment`, `decrement`, and `get_value`) do not automatically inherit the `self` parameter, which is necessary for instance-level operations. Therefore, when `add_lock` decorates these methods, they lose their instance context, leading to incorrect behavior or runtime errors. To fix this issue, each method should be explicitly decorated within the metaclass's `__new__` method after it has been correctly bound to the class instance. This ensures that the lock is applied correctly to every instance method of `ThreadSafeCounter`.
