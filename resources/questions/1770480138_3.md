**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a simple cache mechanism using decorators. The goal is to cache the results of function calls based on their arguments. However, there are some issues with this implementation. Identify and correct these issues.

```python
from functools import wraps

def cache(func):
    cache_dict = {}
    
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in cache_dict:
            cache_dict[args] = func(*args)
        return cache_dict[args]
    
    return wrapper

@cache
def expensive_computation(x, y):
    print(f"Computing {x} + {y}")
    return x + y

# Test the function with a loop to see caching in action
for i in range(5):
    result = expensive_computation(i, i)
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Options:**
A) The cache dictionary is shared among all instances of `cache`.  
B) The function arguments are not properly hashed or compared.  
C) There is no mechanism to invalidate the cache.  
D) All of the above.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is D) All of the above.

**Explanation:**
- **A) The cache dictionary is shared among all instances of `cache`:** This is not an issue in this example because the `cache_dict` is defined inside the `wrapper` function, which means it is local to each decorated function and thus isolated from other functions.
  
- **B) The function arguments are not properly hashed or compared:** Since Python uses the built-in `hash()` function for dictionary keys, and tuples (which are used as keys in this case due to variable positional arguments) are hashable, there should be no issues with hashing. However, if the objects inside the tuple are not hashable themselves, it could cause problems.
  
- **C) There is no mechanism to invalidate the cache:** This is a significant issue because cached results might become invalid over time. For example, if `expensive_computation` depends on external data that changes, caching its result would lead to incorrect outcomes.

Therefore, all three points need to be addressed:
- Ensure that the function arguments are hashable.
- Implement a mechanism to invalidate or refresh cache entries when necessary.
- Optionally, provide a way to clear the entire cache if needed.
