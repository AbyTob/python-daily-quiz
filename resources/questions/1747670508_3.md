    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

def singleton(cls):
    class Wrapper(metaclass=Singleton):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.wrapped = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        def __getattr__(self, name):
            return getattr(self.wrapped, name)
    return Wrapper

@singleton
class DatabaseConnection:
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to the database...")

# Usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1 is db2)  # What will this print?
```

What does the code above print when `db1` and `db2` are compared using the `is` operator?

A) False  
B) True  
C) An error  
D) The message "Connecting to the database..." twice
    
    ## Answer
    B) True

Explanation: In the provided code, both `db1` and `db2` will refer to the same instance of the `DatabaseConnection` class because of the singleton pattern implemented through both a metaclass (`Singleton`) and a decorator (`singleton`). The `metaclass=Singleton` ensures that only one instance of any class decorated with this metaclass can be created. Thus, when `db1 = DatabaseConnection()` and `db2 = DatabaseConnection()`, `db1 is db2` evaluates to True because they both reference the same object.
