    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncHandlerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'handle' in dct:
            dct['async_handle'] = staticmethod(dct['handle'])
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AsyncHandler(metaclass=AsyncHandlerMeta):
    async def handle(self, data):
        print(f"Handling {data} asynchronously")

async def main():
    handler = AsyncHandler()
    await handler.async_handle("task1")
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
    await handler.async_handle("task2")

# Uncomment the following line to run
# asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior of this code when executed?

A) The `handle` method will be called synchronously, and it will block other tasks.

B) The `async_handle` method will be called asynchronously, but it will still block other tasks due to the use of `print`.

C) The `async_handle` method will run concurrently with other tasks thanks to asyncio's event loop.

D) The code will raise an error because `handle` cannot be made asynchronous using this metaclass.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct Answer: C) The `async_handle` method will run concurrently with other tasks thanks to asyncio's event loop.**

**Explanation:** 
The use of a metaclass (`AsyncHandlerMeta`) that converts an instance method `handle` into a static method `async_handle` is crucial here. This allows the original `handle` method, which was designed to be asynchronous (using `await`), to be called without needing to instantiate the class first. The metaclass transformation enables `async_handle` to be used as a regular coroutine within `main`, allowing other tasks (`task2`) to run concurrently due to asyncio's non-blocking nature. This demonstrates a practical use of metaclasses in enhancing the usability and flexibility of asynchronous methods.
