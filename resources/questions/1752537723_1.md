    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import threading

def thread_safe(cls):
    original_init = cls.__init__
    
    def new_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self._lock = threading.Lock()
        original_init(self, *args, **kwargs)
    
    cls.__init__ = new_init
    return cls

@thread_safe
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0
    
    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1

def run_counter():
    counter = Counter()
    for _ in range(100):
        counter.increment()

threads = [threading.Thread(target=run_counter) for _ in range(20)]
for thread in threads:
    thread.start()
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print(f"Final count: {Counter().value}")
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `thread_safe` decorator will ensure that the `increment` method is thread-safe.
B) The final printed value of `counter.value` will always be 2000.
C) The `thread_safe` decorator modifies the class `Counter` to include a lock for each instance, not just the class.
D) None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    A) This statement is incorrect because while the decorator adds a lock to the class, it does not ensure that each method in the class uses this lock. The `increment` method itself must be thread-safe.

B) This statement is also incorrect. Due to race conditions, even with locking around each increment operation, the final printed value of `Counter().value` will likely be less than 2000 due to the non-atomic nature of the increment operation.

C) This statement is correct. The `thread_safe` decorator modifies the `__init__` method to add a lock for each instance created from the decorated class, ensuring that each instance can safely handle concurrent access.

D) Since option C is correct, this statement is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The `thread_safe` decorator modifies the class `Counter` to include a lock for each instance, not just the class.
