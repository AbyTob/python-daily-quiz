    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Data fetched"

class DataFetcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = None
    
    async def get_data(self):
        if self.data is None:
            self.data = await fetch_data()
        return self.data

async def main():
    fetcher1 = DataFetcher()
    fetcher2 = DataFetcher()

    result1 = asyncio.create_task(fetcher1.get_data())
    result2 = asyncio.create_task(fetcher2.get_data())

    print("Result 1:", await result1)
    print("Result 2:", await result2)

asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this code snippet?

A) Fetching data... Result 1: Data fetched Fetching data... Result 2: Data fetched

B) Fetching data... Result 1: Data fetched Result 2: Data fetched (after 2 seconds)

C) Result 1: None Result 2: None

D) Error: fetch_data() cannot be awaited in __init__

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Fetching data... Result 1: Data fetched Fetching data... Result 2: Data fetched

Explanation:
In the provided code, `DataFetcher` is an asynchronous class with a coroutine method `get_data`. The first call to `fetcher1.get_data()` will initiate the fetching process and await the result. Since `self.data` is `None`, it triggers the `await fetch_data()`. Meanwhile, when `fetcher2.get_data()` is called, it finds that `self.data` has already been set in `fetcher1` (due to Python's global interpreter lock during the first coroutine execution), so it returns immediately without fetching again. Therefore, both calls will print "Fetching data..." followed by "Result 1: Data fetched" and "Result 2: Data fetched", but they might not be exactly after each other due to asyncio task scheduling.

The output demonstrates that asynchronous methods can share state between instances of the same class in a thread-safe manner within an async context.
