    ## Answer
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, duration):
        self.duration = duration
        self.start_time = None

    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        elapsed_time = asyncio.get_running_loop().time() - self.start_time
        print(f"Timer ended in {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")

async def main():
    async with AsyncTimer(2) as timer:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("One second has passed")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of the code when executed?

A) One second has passed
B) Timer ended in 0.5 seconds
C) Timer ended in 2.0 seconds
D) Timer ended in 3.0 seconds

Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is D) Timer ended in 3.0 seconds.

Explanation:
When the `AsyncTimer` context manager is entered, it records the start time using `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()`. The coroutine inside the `with` block then sleeps for 1 second twice, totaling 2 seconds of sleep. However, the total execution time from when the context manager is entered to when it's exited includes these sleep durations plus the time taken by the `__aexit__` method to calculate and print the elapsed time.

The `__aexit__` method calculates the elapsed time as follows:
- Start time: Recorded at the beginning of the context manager.
- End time: When the coroutine inside the block finishes executing.
- Elapsed time: Difference between end time and start time, which is 2 seconds (sleep durations) plus the negligible time taken by `__aexit__` itself.

Thus, when the output is printed, it shows "Timer ended in 3.0 seconds," indicating that the total execution time includes both sleep durations.
