    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of `Singleton` can be created.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = None

# Usage
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

assert s1 is s2  # This assertion should pass if the singleton pattern is correctly implemented.
```

Which of the following statements about the given code and its implementation of the singleton pattern is true?

A) The metaclass `SingletonMeta` ensures that only one instance of any subclass of `Singleton` can be created.
B) The `__call__` method in the metaclass checks if an instance already exists, and if not, creates a new one. If it does exist, it returns the existing instance.
C) Using this singleton pattern, if you modify the attribute `value` on one instance, it will also be modified on another instance due to their shared memory.
D) The assertion `assert s1 is s2` can never pass because of Python's garbage collection mechanism.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
B) The `__call__` method in the metaclass checks if an instance already exists, and if not, creates a new one. If it does exist, it returns the existing instance.

This answer is correct because the `SingletonMeta` metaclass overrides the `__call__` method to control the instantiation process. It checks whether an instance of the class has already been created and stored in `_instances`. If so, it returns that instance; otherwise, it creates a new one. This ensures that only one instance of `Singleton` can be created, adhering to the singleton pattern.
