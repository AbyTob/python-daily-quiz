    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a metaclass for a class to ensure that it cannot be instantiated more than once:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MySingleton(metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

# Attempting to instantiate multiple times
a = MySingleton()
b = MySingleton()

print(a is b)  # Output: True or False?
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what will be printed when `a is b` is executed?

A) `True`
B) `False`
C) The code will raise an exception.
D) The output cannot be determined without further context.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**
The correct answer is A) `True`.

Explanation: 
In the provided code, the `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of any class using it can be created. When `MySingleton()` is called for the first time, an instance is created and stored in `_instances`. When `MySingleton()` is called again, since the instance already exists in `_instances`, the same instance is returned, resulting in `a is b` being `True`.
