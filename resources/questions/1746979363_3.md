    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that attempts to implement a custom context manager using both a class decorator and a metaclass:

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Entering {func.__name__}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Exiting {func.__name__}")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'enter' in dct and 'exit' in dct:
            dct['__enter__'] = log_decorator(dct.pop('enter'))
            dct['__exit__'] = log_decorator(dct.pop('exit'))
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class ContextManager(metaclass=Meta):
    def enter(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement 'enter' method")

    def exit(self):
        pass

class MyContextManager(ContextManager):
    def __init__(self, resource):
        self.resource = resource

    def enter(self):
        print(f"Acquired {self.resource}")
        return self.resource

    def exit(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print(f"Released {self.resource}")

with MyContextManager("lock") as lock:
    print("Inside context manager")
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `log_decorator` will not be applied to any methods.

B) The `enter` and `exit` methods will be logged before and after their execution.

C) The `ContextManager` class must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods for the context manager to work correctly.

D) There will be a runtime error because `Meta` does not properly delegate the implementation of `__enter__` and `__exit__`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The `ContextManager` class must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods for the context manager to work correctly.

The correct answer is C. Here's why:

- In the provided code, the `Meta` metaclass checks if `enter` and `exit` methods are defined in any subclass of `ContextManager`. If they are, it replaces them with decorated versions using `log_decorator`.
- For a class to be usable as a context manager, it must implement both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. The `Meta` metaclass ensures that these methods are present before replacing them with the decorated versions.
- If the subclass does not define either method, they will remain unmodified, but the context manager will still be valid as long as other necessary methods (like `__init__`) are implemented.

Options A, B, and D are incorrect:
- A is wrong because `log_decorator` is applied to both the original `enter` and `exit` methods.
- B is not entirely correct because the decorator only logs the method calls if they exist in the subclass. If either `enter` or `exit` is missing, it won't be logged.
- D is incorrect because there is no issue with how `Meta` handles the methods; it correctly checks and decorates them if present.
