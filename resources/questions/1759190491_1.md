    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add a method dynamically to classes:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: f"Method added by {name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.dynamic_method())
```

What will be the output when `print(obj.dynamic_method())` is executed?  
A. `None`  
B. `"Method added by Meta"`  
C. An error is raised  
D. The program crashes
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer: B. `"Method added by Meta"`

Explanation:** In Python, metaclasses allow for the customization of class creation. In this example, a metaclass named `Meta` is defined to add a method called `dynamic_method` to any class that uses it as its metaclass. The `__new__` method of the metaclass is overridden to dynamically add the method to the class dictionary (`dct`). When an instance of `MyClass` is created, and the `dynamic_method` is called on this instance, it executes successfully, printing `"Method added by Meta"` as a result of the dynamic method addition.
