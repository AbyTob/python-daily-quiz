    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result

@Timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(i for i in range(n))

compute_sum(10000000)
```

What does the `Timer` class and its use as a decorator achieve, and how can it be improved to make it more generic and reusable across different functions?

A) The timer measures the execution time of `compute_sum` but cannot be reused for other functions.

B) The timer measures the execution time of `compute_sum` and can be reused for other functions by creating an instance of `Timer` with another function.

C) The timer measures the execution time of `compute_sum` and can be reused across different functions by passing the function as a parameter to the `Timer` class constructor instead of using it as a decorator.

D) The timer does not measure any execution time and simply returns the result of `compute_sum`.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The timer measures the execution time of `compute_sum` and can be reused across different functions by passing the function as a parameter to the `Timer` class constructor instead of using it as a decorator.

The given code uses a simple decorator pattern where the `Timer` class is designed to measure the execution time of any function it decorates. However, this implementation is not generic because it requires the user to define a `__init__` method that takes a function and store it in an instance variable. A more flexible approach would allow for reusing the same timer instance with different functions. This can be achieved by modifying the `Timer` class to take the function as a parameter when calling the decorated function, rather than storing it in an instance variable.
