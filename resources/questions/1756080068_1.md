    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following code snippet that attempts to create a custom metaclass for logging instance creation:

```python
import types

class LoggerMeta(type):
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Creating an instance of {cls.__name__}")
        return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

class MyClass(metaclass=LoggerMeta):
    pass

# Usage
obj = MyClass()
```

What is the expected output when creating an instance of `MyClass`?

A) "Creating an instance of MyClass"

B) An error because metaclasses cannot be used with simple classes

C) The class definition fails to compile

D) No output at all
    
    ## Answer
