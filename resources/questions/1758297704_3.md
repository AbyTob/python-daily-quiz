    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a Singleton pattern:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

# Using the class
a = MyClass()
b = MyClass()

print(a is b)  # Output: True or False?
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the output of `print(a is b)`?

A) The output will always be `True`.

B) The output will always be `False`.

C) The output depends on whether the Singleton pattern was successfully implemented.

D) None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
C) The output depends on whether the Singleton pattern was successfully implemented.

Explanation: The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it. In the provided code, the metaclass `Singleton` attempts to implement this pattern by storing instances in a dictionary `_instances`. However, the code is incomplete and does not fully enforce the Singleton pattern correctly. Specifically, there are no checks to ensure that if an instance already exists, it is returned instead of creating a new one. Additionally, the dictionary `_instances` is not thread-safe, which could lead to multiple instances being created in a multi-threaded environment. Therefore, the output of `print(a is b)` cannot be guaranteed and depends on how robustly the Singleton pattern was implemented and whether any threading issues were handled properly.
