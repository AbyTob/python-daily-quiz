    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question): 
Consider the following Python code that uses metaclasses to create a simple logging system. The goal is to track all methods called on instances of the class it decorates.

```python
class LoggerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = cls.wrap_method(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def wrap_method(method):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Calling {method.__name__}")
            return method(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

class MyClass(metaclass=LoggerMeta):
    def method1(self):
        pass

    def method2(self):
        pass
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, all its methods are immediately wrapped with logging.
B) The `LoggerMeta` class can only be used to create classes that inherit from `MyClass`.
C) Calling `method1()` on an instance of `MyClass` will print "Calling method1" before executing the method body.
D) The code does not handle any errors or exceptions within the wrapped methods.

Part 2 (Answer):
C) Calling `method1()` on an instance of `MyClass` will print "Calling method1" before executing the method body.

Explanation:
The `LoggerMeta` metaclass in this example is a class decorator that automatically wraps all callable attributes (methods) with logging functionality when the class is defined. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the methods `method1()` and `method2()` are already wrapped by `wrap_method`, which adds a print statement before calling the original method.

Option A is incorrect because wrapping happens at class definition time, not at instance creation.
Option B is incorrect as `LoggerMeta` can be used with any class that does not have its own metaclass conflicting with it.
Option D is not correct; while this example doesn't explicitly handle exceptions within the wrapped methods, it's possible to extend the `wrap_method` function to include exception handling if needed.
