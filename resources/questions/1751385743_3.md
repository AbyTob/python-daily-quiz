    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code snippet that attempts to create a decorator to measure execution time of asynchronous functions:

```python
import asyncio

def async_time_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds to execute")
        return result
    return wrapper

@async_time_decorator
async def example_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)

# Call the async function using asyncio's event loop
asyncio.run(example_async_function())
```

What is a potential issue with this implementation?

A) The decorator does not handle exceptions that might be raised by the function it decorates.

B) The `wrapper` function must be marked as `async`, but `async_time_decorator` itself can be defined without the `async` keyword.

C) The decorator correctly measures execution time for asynchronous functions.

D) Using `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` inside the decorator might lead to inaccurate timing due to context switching.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator does not handle exceptions that might be raised by the function it decorates.

Explanation:
The provided implementation of `async_time_decorator` is correct in terms of measuring the execution time for asynchronous functions. However, a potential issue with this approach is that it does not handle exceptions that might be raised during the execution of the decorated function. If an exception occurs inside the decorated function, the decorator will catch it and print a message indicating the time taken to execute (which would be 0 since no time has passed), but the original exception will be lost. A more robust solution would be to handle exceptions appropriately or pass them up to the caller:

```python
import asyncio

def async_time_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        try:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            end = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
            print(f"{func.__name__} raised an exception after {end - start:.4f} seconds")
            raise e
        end = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds to execute")
        return result
    return wrapper

@async_time_decorator
async def example_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    raise ValueError("An error occurred")

try:
    asyncio.run(example_async_function())
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # This will print "An error occurred"
```
