    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses decorators for memoization in a function:

```python
def memoize(func):
    cache = {}
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in cache:
            cache[args] = func(*args)
        return cache[args]
    return wrapper

@memoize
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
result = fibonacci(10)
```

Which of the following statements accurately describes a potential issue with using this memoization decorator in a multi-threaded environment?

A) The `memoize` decorator will not work correctly because it is stateful and not thread-safe.
B) The `memoize` decorator will work correctly because Python's global interpreter lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread can execute at a time.
C) The `memoize` decorator may return incorrect results if multiple threads simultaneously calculate the same value.
D) There is no issue with using this memoization decorator in a multi-threaded environment.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `memoize` decorator will not work correctly because it is stateful and not thread-safe.

Explanation: The `memoize` decorator uses a global dictionary to store results, which can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. If two threads attempt to calculate the same value at the same time, they might both compute the result independently before checking the cache, leading to duplicate computations and potentially incorrect results. To make this memoization thread-safe, you would need to add synchronization mechanisms like locks to protect access to the cache dictionary.
