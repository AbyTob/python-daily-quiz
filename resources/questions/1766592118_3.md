    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
from datetime import datetime

class TimingDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = datetime.now()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = datetime.now()
        print(f"Function {self.func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} to execute")
        return result

@TimingDecorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(1, n+1))

result = compute_sum(1000000)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `TimingDecorator` class uses metaclasses to measure function execution time.
B) The `compute_sum` function will not execute because it's decorated with a non-callable object.
C) The decorator correctly measures and prints the execution time of the `compute_sum` function.
D) The `TimingDecorator` class is used for creating new classes, not for modifying existing ones.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The decorator correctly measures and prints the execution time of the `compute_sum` function.

Explanation:
The `TimingDecorator` class implements both `__init__` and `__call__` methods. The `__call__` method is used to make instances of the class callable, allowing them to be used as decorators. When `@TimingDecorator` decorates a function like `compute_sum`, the decorator instance is called with `compute_sum` as its argument, and it wraps the original function to measure its execution time. The output will correctly show the time taken by the `compute_sum` function to execute.
