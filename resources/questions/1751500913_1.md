    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to dynamically add a method to any class it decorates. The goal is to understand how this mechanism works, especially in terms of when and how the method is added.

```python
class DynamicMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Add a dynamic method to the class at decoration time
        def dynamic_method(self):
            return "Dynamic Method Called"
        
        dct['dynamic_method'] = dynamic_method
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=DynamicMethodMeta):
    pass

# Usage
obj = MyClass()
result = obj.dynamic_method()  # This should call the dynamically added method
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding how and when `dynamic_method` is added to `MyClass`?

A) The method is added at runtime when an instance of `MyClass` is created.
B) The method is added at class definition time due to the metaclass's `__new__` method.
C) The method is added when an instance of a subclass of `MyClass` is created.
D) The method is not added, and `dynamic_method` will raise an AttributeError.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

B) The method is added at class definition time due to the metaclass's `__new__` method.

Explanation: In Python, when a class is defined using a metaclass, the metaclassâ€™s `__new__` method is invoked to create the class object. In this case, the `DynamicMethodMeta.__new__` method adds the `dynamic_method` function directly to the dictionary of the class being created (`dct`). This happens before any instances of `MyClass` are created, ensuring that all instances and subclasses of `MyClass` will have access to the dynamically added method.
