    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    async def increment(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        self.count += 1

async def main():
    counter = AsyncCounter()
    tasks = [counter.increment() for _ in range(5)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the execution and behavior of this code?

A) The `increment` method will run concurrently, and all increments will be completed after 1 second.

B) The `increment` method will run sequentially, one at a time, completing each increment before moving to the next.

C) Each call to `counter.increment()` in `main` will block other tasks from running until the sleep completes.

D) The code will raise an exception because the `increment` method is not awaited properly in the loop.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `increment` method will run concurrently, and all increments will be completed after 1 second.
