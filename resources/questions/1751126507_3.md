    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a decorator which measures execution time of a function. However, it does not work as expected when applied to asynchronous functions.

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds to execute")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
async def async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(async_function())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code snippet?

A) The decorator `timing_decorator` will correctly measure the execution time of the `async_function`.

B) The decorator `timing_decorator` will raise an error because it does not support asynchronous functions.

C) The decorator `timing_decorator` will work but will only print the time taken for the function to run up to the point where it is paused in the async operation.

D) The decorator `timing_decorator` will complete successfully but will not output any execution time information because the asynchronous operation completes immediately and does not block the main thread.
    
    ## Answer
    [B] The decorator `timing_decorator` will raise an error because it does not support asynchronous functions.

Explanation: The provided decorator uses `time.time()` which returns the current CPU time, not the actual elapsed wall-clock time. When applied to an asynchronous function, the execution of the async function is not blocking the main thread, so `time.time()` before and after the call will return approximately the same value, leading to a zero execution time being printed. Additionally, since the decorator does not handle coroutines correctly, calling it with an `async` function will result in an error because the decorator expects synchronous functions.
