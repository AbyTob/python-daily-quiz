    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {self.func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result

@Timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(1, n+1))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_sum(1000000)
```

What happens when you run the above script? Explain why this decorator works as expected.

A) The `compute_sum` function will not be executed because the decorator is incorrectly implemented.
B) The `Timer` class will fail to execute due to a syntax error in its implementation.
C) When `compute_sum(1000000)` is called, it will print the execution time and return the sum of numbers from 1 to 1000000.
D) A TypeError will be raised because the decorator does not handle positional arguments correctly.
