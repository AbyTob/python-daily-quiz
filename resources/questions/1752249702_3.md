    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a decorator to measure the execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

print(compute_sum(1000000))
```

This code works as expected when called directly. However, when trying to use the `compute_sum` function within a list comprehension or another iterable context, the decorator's print statement is not executed correctly.

Which of the following statements explains why this happens and provides a correct fix?

A) The decorator does not handle asynchronous functions.
B) The print statement inside the wrapper function is not thread-safe.
C) The decorator incorrectly calculates the execution time due to overlapping times.
D) The `wrapper` function returns a coroutine instead of the result.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The decorator incorrectly calculates the execution time due to overlapping times.

Explanation: The issue arises because each call to `compute_sum(1000000)` within another iterable context does not re-run the `timing_decorator`. Instead, it uses the same timing information from the first run of the function. This leads to incorrect and overlapping timing results. To fix this, ensure that the decorator measures execution time independently for each call, possibly by moving the print statement inside the wrapper's conditional block or using a different approach to measure time in each iteration.
