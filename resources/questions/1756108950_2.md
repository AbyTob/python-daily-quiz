    **Part 1 (Question):**  
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to implement a simple caching mechanism using decorators. However, it fails to achieve its intended purpose. Your task is to identify the issue with the code and suggest a fix.

```python
import time

def cache_results(func):
    cache = {}
    
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        
        result = func(*args)
        cache[args] = result
        return result
    
    return wrapper

@cache_results
def expensive_function(x):
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate an expensive operation
    return x * 2

# Usage
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should take about 1 second
print(expensive_function(5))  # This should be instant, as it uses the cache
```

Which of the following options correctly identifies the issue and provides a suitable fix?

A) The `cache` dictionary is not thread-safe. Use a threading lock to ensure thread safety.

B) The decorator does not handle keyword arguments properly. Modify the `wrapper` function to accept and pass through keyword arguments.

C) The cache should be cleared periodically to prevent memory leaks. Implement a mechanism to clear the cache after a certain period.

D) The `cache_results` decorator is incorrectly using a global scope for the cache dictionary. Encapsulate it in a closure or use a class-based approach.

**Part 2 (Answer):**  
B) The decorator does not handle keyword arguments properly. Modify the `wrapper` function to accept and pass through keyword arguments.

The issue with the provided code is that it only caches results based on positional arguments, ignoring any keyword arguments. When keyword arguments are used, a new cache entry would be created for each set of keyword arguments, leading to unnecessary computations.

To fix this, modify the `wrapper` function to accept and pass through both positional and keyword arguments using `*args` and `**kwargs`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import time

def cache_results(func):
    cache = {}
    
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        key = args + tuple(kwargs.items())
        
        if key in cache:
            return cache[key]
        
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        cache[key] = result
        return result
    
    return wrapper

@cache_results
def expensive_function(x, y=10):
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate an expensive operation
    return x * y

# Usage
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should take about 1 second
print(expensive_function(5, y=20))  # This should be instant, as it uses the cache with different kwargs
print(expensive_function(5))  # This should also be instant, using the same cached result
```
