    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass and decorators to create a class with enhanced functionality:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import time

# Define a decorator for measuring execution time
def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Define a metaclass that applies the timer decorator to all methods of a class
class TimedMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = timer(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Create a class using the TimedMeta metaclass
class Task(metaclass=TimedMeta):
    def heavy_task(self):
        time.sleep(2)  # Simulate a heavy computation

    def light_task(self):
        pass  # A very quick operation

if __name__ == "__main__":
    task = Task()
    task.heavy_task()
    task.light_task()
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `heavy_task` and `light_task` methods will both execute in approximately 2 seconds because they are decorated with the `timer` decorator.

B) Only the `heavy_task` method will print its execution time, as it uses a generator that yields the result after a delay.

C) Both methods will print their execution times, but only `heavy_task` will show an actual delay of approximately 2 seconds in execution.

D) The `light_task` method will not execute at all because it is decorated with the `timer` decorator and does nothing meaningful.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) Both methods will print their execution times, but only `heavy_task` will show an actual delay of approximately 2 seconds in execution.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `TimedMeta` dynamically decorates all callable attributes (methods) with the `timer` decorator.
- When an instance of the `Task` class is created and its methods are called, the `timer` decorator measures and prints the execution time for each method.
- The `heavy_task` method includes a sleep operation that delays its completion by approximately 2 seconds. This delay is measured and printed.
- The `light_task` method does not perform any meaningful work (it's just an empty pass statement), but it will still have its execution time measured and printed by the `timer` decorator.
