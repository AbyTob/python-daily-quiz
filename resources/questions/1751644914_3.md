# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure that all instances of a class have unique names. However, there's a flaw in this implementation that could lead to unexpected behavior.

```python
class UniqueNameMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls.__name__ not in UniqueNameMeta._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            UniqueNameMeta._instances[cls.__name__] = instance
        return UniqueNameMeta._instances[cls.__name__]

class MyClass(metaclass=UniqueNameMeta):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

# Example usage:
obj1 = MyClass("Alice")
obj2 = MyClass("Alice")

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Expected: False
```

Which of the following options correctly identifies and fixes the flaw in the provided code?

A) The `__call__` method should use `cls.name` instead of `cls.__name__` to ensure uniqueness.

B) A dictionary key collision might occur if two classes with the same name but different module names are created.

C) The metaclass should not store instances in a class variable `_instances`.

D) The code is correct as it already ensures that all instances have unique names.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
B) A dictionary key collision might occur if two classes with the same name but different module names are created.

**Explanation**: The provided metaclass `UniqueNameMeta` uses the class's `__name__` attribute to store instances in a class variable `_instances`. This approach will cause a collision if two classes with the same name exist in different modules. For example, if you have `MyClass` in both `module1.py` and `module2.py`, they would be considered the same class by the metaclass, leading to incorrect behavior where instances of these "same" classes overwrite each other in the `_instances` dictionary.
