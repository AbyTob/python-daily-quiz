    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to dynamically add methods to a class. The goal is to create a new method `double_value` in any class that inherits from `BaseClass` using this metaclass.

```python
class MetaDouble(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'value' not in dct:
            raise ValueError("The class must have a 'value' attribute.")
        dct['double_value'] = lambda self: self.value * 2
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(metaclass=MetaDouble):
    pass

class MyClass(BaseClass):
    value = 5

# Test the implementation
my_instance = MyClass()
print(my_instance.double_value())  # Expected output: 10
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The metaclass `MetaDouble` correctly adds a `double_value` method to any class inheriting from `BaseClass`.

B) The metaclass `MetaDouble` will raise an error because it does not handle cases where the `value` attribute is missing.

C) The implementation of `MyClass` is incorrect as it should inherit directly from `MetaDouble` instead of `BaseClass`.

D) The `double_value` method in `MyClass` will return `None` because the method is not properly defined in `MetaDouble`.
    
    ## Answer
    [A] The metaclass `MetaDouble` correctly adds a `double_value` method to any class inheriting from `BaseClass`.

Explanation: The metaclass `MetaDouble` checks if the class has a `value` attribute. If it does, it dynamically adds a `double_value` method that returns twice the value of the `value` attribute. In this case, when `MyClass` inherits from `BaseClass`, which uses `MetaDouble`, and defines a `value` attribute, the `double_value` method is successfully added to `MyClass`.
