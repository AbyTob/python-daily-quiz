    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
    
    async def increment(self):
        self.count += 1
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
    
    async def get_count(self):
        return self.count

async def main():
    counter = AsyncCounter()
    tasks = [counter.increment() for _ in range(5)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(await counter.get_count())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    asyncio.run(main())
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the execution of this code?

A) The program will run indefinitely as `asyncio.sleep(1)` blocks the event loop.

B) The total count printed at the end will be 5, and the execution time will be approximately 5 seconds due to the sleep calls.

C) The total count printed will be less than 5 because some increments might not complete due to context switching.

D) The program will raise an exception because `counter.get_count()` cannot be awaited without an instance of `AsyncCounter`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B

The program will run for approximately 5 seconds, as the `await asyncio.sleep(1)` calls in the `increment` method cause the coroutine to yield control back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run. By the time all five increments are completed, each taking one second, the total count will be 5 and the execution time will be close to 5 seconds.
