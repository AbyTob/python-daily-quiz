    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a simple cache mechanism for functions. The goal is to cache the results of function calls so that if the same arguments are passed again, the cached result is returned instead of recomputing it.

```python
from functools import wraps

def cache_results(func):
    cache = {}
    
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        else:
            result = func(*args)
            cache[args] = result
            return result
    
    return wrapper

@cache_results
def expensive_function(x):
    # Simulate an expensive computation
    print(f"Computing {x}")
    return x * x

# Example usage
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should compute and cache the result
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should retrieve the cached result
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `cache_results` decorator correctly implements caching for the function it decorates.
B) The use of a dictionary to store the cache within the decorator is problematic and will lead to memory leaks.
C) The `wrapper` function does not need the `@wraps(func)` decorator because it's not essential for maintaining the original function's metadata.
D) The caching mechanism can be improved by making the cache thread-safe.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] D

**Explanation:** The caching mechanism implemented in the code is correct, but the caching itself is not thread-safe. Multiple threads could potentially write to and read from the `cache` dictionary simultaneously without proper synchronization, which could lead to data corruption or race conditions. By using a thread-safe dictionary or implementing locks within the decorator, this issue can be resolved.
