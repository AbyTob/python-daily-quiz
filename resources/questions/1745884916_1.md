    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a Python application that needs to track the creation of all instances of a certain class. You decide to use a metaclass for this purpose. Here is a partially complete code snippet:

```python
class InstanceTracker(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        new_class = super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        # Task: Add code here to track the creation of instances
        return new_class

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceTracker):
    pass

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(InstanceTracker._instances)  # Expected output: {'MyClass': [obj1, obj2]}
```

Which line of code should be added to the `__new__` method in the `InstanceTracker` metaclass to track the creation of instances?

A) `cls._instances[name].append(instance)`
B) `self._instances[name] = []`
C) `self._instances[name].append(self())`
D) `self._instances[name].append(new_class())`
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] C

Explanation:
In the provided code, we need to track the creation of instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass. The current implementation does not add any logic to track instances. 

Option A is incorrect because `instance` is not defined in the scope where this line would be executed.
Option B is incorrect because it attempts to create a new list for each class but does not append any instances to it.
Option C is correct because it appends an instance of the newly created class to a list associated with the class name. The `self()` call inside `append` creates a new instance of the class, which is then added to the list stored in `_instances`.
Option D is incorrect because it tries to append the metaclass itself rather than an instance of the class.

Adding this line to the `__new__` method will correctly track and store instances of classes that use the `InstanceTracker` metaclass.
