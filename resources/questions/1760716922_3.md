    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Data fetched"

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data("http://example.com"))
    while not task.done():
        print("Fetching...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
    
    result = await task
    print(result)

# Uncomment the following line to run the code
# asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the above code?

A) The `fetch_data` function will not start executing until it is awaited.
B) The `main` function will complete before the data is fetched because it does not wait for the task to finish.
C) The program will print "Fetching..." three times before completing.
D) The use of `asyncio.create_task` creates a new thread that runs concurrently with the main function.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) The `fetch_data` function will not start executing until it is awaited.  
Correct. In Python's asyncio, an asynchronous function (`async def`) will only execute when its result is awaited, which happens inside another coroutine.

B) The `main` function will complete before the data is fetched because it does not wait for the task to finish.  
Incorrect. The `main` function uses a while loop with `await asyncio.sleep(1)` until the task is done, ensuring it waits for the data fetching to complete.

C) The program will print "Fetching..." three times before completing.  
Incorrect. The loop in the `main` function will run twice (for 2 seconds), and then the `fetch_data` function will execute once, printing "Data fetched".

D) The use of `asyncio.create_task` creates a new thread that runs concurrently with the main function.  
Incorrect. `asyncio.create_task` schedules the coroutine for execution in the asyncio event loop, not in a new thread. This means it is still part of the single-threaded asynchronous model managed by Python's asyncio.
