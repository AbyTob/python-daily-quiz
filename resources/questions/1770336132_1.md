    ## Question
    [ANSWER_SEPARATOR] **Question:**  
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval

    async def start(self):
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
            print(f"Timer ticked at {self.interval} seconds")

async def main():
    timers = [AsyncTimer(i) for i in range(1, 4)]
    tasks = [timer.start() for timer in timers]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# Run the async main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior of this program when run?

A) It creates three `AsyncTimer` instances with intervals of 1, 2, and 3 seconds. Each timer starts running immediately and prints a tick every second.

B) It creates three `AsyncTimer` instances with intervals of 1, 2, and 3 seconds. The timers do not start running until the `asyncio.gather` call.

C) It raises an error because it tries to create multiple asynchronous tasks from the same instance method (`start`) which is not allowed in asyncio.

D) It creates three `AsyncTimer` instances with intervals of 1, 2, and 3 seconds. The first timer ticks every second, the second every 2 seconds, and the third every 3 seconds.

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR] **Answer:**  
A) It creates three `AsyncTimer` instances with intervals of 1, 2, and 3 seconds. Each timer starts running immediately and prints a tick every second.

**Explanation:**  
In Python's asyncio library, creating multiple tasks from the same instance method does not cause an error. Each task is independent and runs concurrently. In this code, `asyncio.gather` is used to run all the tasks concurrently, so each timer will start running immediately after their creation and tick at their respective intervals.
