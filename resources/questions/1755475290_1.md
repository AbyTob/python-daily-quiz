    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators to modify a class's behavior dynamically:

```python
def add_method(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        print("Method added at runtime")
        func(self)
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Dynamically adding methods to an existing class
MyClass.display_value = add_method(print)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    obj = MyClass(10)
    obj.display_value()
```

What will be the output when running this code? 

A) `Method added at runtime`  
B) `10 Method added at runtime`  
C) The code will raise a TypeError  
D) An empty line followed by `Method added at runtime`
    
    ## Answer
    The correct answer is A) `Method added at runtime`.

Explanation: When you run this code, the `add_method` decorator is used to add a new method named `display_value` to the `MyClass` class at runtime. The `wrapper` function inside the decorator prints "Method added at runtime" and then calls the original function (which in this case is `print`). Since no arguments are passed to `print`, it defaults to printing nothing followed by a newline, resulting in an empty line being printed first, and then "Method added at runtime".
