    ## Answer
    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(task_id):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Data for task {task_id}"

async def main():
    tasks = [fetch_data(i) for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

The `fetch_data` function simulates a network request that takes 1 second to complete. The `main` function creates a list of tasks that fetch data concurrently using `asyncio.gather`. If an exception occurs during the execution of any task, it should be caught and handled gracefully.

Which of the following statements about the provided code is true?

A) All tasks will complete in 1 second because they are executed concurrently.  
B) The `return_exceptions=True` parameter allows for exceptions to propagate if not caught.  
C) If an exception occurs, it will stop all other tasks from executing.  
D) Each task runs on a separate thread, thus improving performance.

**Part 2: Answer**

A) Correct. All tasks will complete in 1 second because they are executed concurrently using `asyncio.gather`. The `await asyncio.sleep(1)` line suspends the execution of each task for 1 second without blocking other tasks.

B) Incorrect. The `return_exceptions=True` parameter allows exceptions to be caught and returned as part of the results list, not propagate if not caught.

C) Incorrect. If an exception occurs in a task, it will only stop that specific task from completing; other tasks will continue to execute.

D) Incorrect. The provided code does not create separate threads for each task. It uses asyncio's event loop to manage asynchronous execution, which is single-threaded but can handle multiple tasks concurrently.
