# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass and class decoration:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class MyClass:
    pass

def decorator(cls):
    print("Decorating class")
    return cls

MyClass = decorator(MyClass)
```

What will be the output of this code when executed?

A) Creating class MyClass  
B) Decorating class  
C) Both A and B  
D) Neither A nor B
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
C) Both A and B

Explanation:
The metaclass `Meta` is invoked when the class `MyClass` is created, printing "Creating class MyClass". The decorator `decorator` is then applied to `MyClass`, which also prints "Decorating class". Therefore, both outputs are produced.
