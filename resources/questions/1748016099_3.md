    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return asyncio.run(self.func(*args, **kwargs))

@AsyncDecorator
async def fetch_data(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.text()

# Usage
result = fetch_data('https://api.example.com/data')
print(result)
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `AsyncDecorator` class does not use any asyncio features.

B) When calling `fetch_data`, it will block the event loop until the data is fetched.

C) The `fetch_data` function is automatically converted into a coroutine when decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`.

D) The decorator correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions seamlessly.
    
    ## Answer
    D) The decorator correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions seamlessly.

Explanation: 
The `AsyncDecorator` class defines an `__init__` method that stores the original function, and a `__call__` method that uses `asyncio.run()` to execute the decorated function within the asyncio event loop. Since `fetch_data` is defined as an `async def`, it does not need to be made synchronous; it can be directly run using `asyncio.run()`. Therefore, the decorator correctly handles asynchronous functions without interfering with their async nature.
