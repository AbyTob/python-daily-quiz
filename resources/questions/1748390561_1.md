    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

**Question:**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncLogger:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    async def log(self, message):
        print(f"{self.name}: {message}")

async def main():
    logger = AsyncLogger("INFO")
    await asyncio.gather(
        logger.log("Starting"),
        logger.log("Processing"),
        logger.log("Ending")
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this code, and how can you modify it to ensure that `logger` is not garbage collected before all logging tasks complete?

**Options:**
A) The output will be "INFO: Starting", "INFO: Processing", "INFO: Ending" in any order.  
B) The output will be "INFO: Starting", "INFO: Processing", "INFO: Ending" in that specific order.  
C) The code will raise a `RuntimeError` because the logger is not properly managed.  
D) The output will be "INFO: Starting", "INFO: Processing", and it will hang waiting for the final "Ending".
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**Answer:** B) The output will be "INFO: Starting", "INFO: Processing", "INFO: Ending" in that specific order.

**Explanation:**

The given code uses `asyncio.gather` to concurrently run multiple tasks, each of which logs a message. Since all tasks are awaited within the `main` function, they will execute in sequence because `asyncio.gather` schedules them to run as soon as possible but does not guarantee their order if there is any overlap.

To ensure that `logger` is not garbage collected before all logging tasks complete, we need to keep a reference to it. In Python, an object is considered garbage collectible only when there are no more references pointing to it. By keeping the `logger` variable in scope until after all tasks have completed, it ensures that it remains alive long enough for the garbage collector to determine if it can be freed.

For example:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncLogger:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    async def log(self, message):
        print(f"{self.name}: {message}")

async def main():
    logger = AsyncLogger("INFO")
    await asyncio.gather(
        logger.log("Starting"),
        logger.log("Processing"),
        logger.log("Ending")
    )
    del logger  # Explicitly deleting the reference to allow garbage collection

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this modified version, the `logger` variable is explicitly deleted after all tasks have completed. This ensures that `logger` can be garbage collected if no other references to it exist. However, in practical scenarios, you generally don’t need to explicitly delete variables as Python’s garbage collector handles most cases automatically.
