    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

def time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def async_task(n):
    await asyncio.sleep(n)
    return n

async def main():
    tasks = [async_task(i) for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What does this code do, and how can it be improved to ensure that the `time_decorator` works correctly with asynchronous functions?

A) It measures the time taken for each task in `async_task` but has a race condition.

B) It accurately measures the time taken for each task in `async_task`, but it will not work without `await asyncio.gather`.

C) It measures the time taken for each task in `async_task` and works correctly with asynchronous functions. There is no need for any improvements.

D) It measures the time taken for each task in `async_task`, but it won't print the results.
    
    ## Answer
    [C] It measures the time taken for each task in `async_task` and works correctly with asynchronous functions. There is no need for any improvements.

The code provided uses a decorator to measure the execution time of an asynchronous function. The `time_decorator` is applied to `async_task`, which sleeps for a given number of seconds. When run, it accurately measures the time taken by each task using `await asyncio.sleep(n)` and prints it correctly. There are no issues with this code that would prevent it from working as intended.
