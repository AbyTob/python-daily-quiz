    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    async def fetch_data(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        return f"Data: {self.value}"

async def main():
    tasks = [AsyncClass(i).fetch_data() for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the code above?

A) The `main` function will run indefinitely due to an infinite loop.  
B) All tasks are scheduled immediately when `main` is called, and they execute concurrently.  
C) Only one task can run at a time because it uses synchronous `sleep`.  
D) The `fetch_data` method must be awaited inside the `__init__` method for proper execution.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) All tasks are scheduled immediately when `main` is called, and they execute concurrently. 

Explanation: 
- In Python's asyncio library, the `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` function schedules all tasks concurrently and waits for them to complete before continuing. Therefore, all `fetch_data` calls are executed simultaneously.
- The `await asyncio.sleep(1)` inside `fetch_data` does not block other tasks; it only suspends the current task temporarily until the sleep is over.
- Options A, C, and D contain incorrect assumptions about how async/await works in Python.
