# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following code snippet that uses both metaclasses and class decorators:

```python
def decorator(cls):
    cls.new_attr = "Added by decorator"
    return cls

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['from_meta'] = "Added by metaclass"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass
```

What will be the output of the following code?

```python
print(MyClass.new_attr)
print(MyClass.from_meta)
```

A) "Added by decorator" and "None"
B) "Added by decorator" and "Added by metaclass"
C) "None" and "Added by metaclass"
D) "None" and "None"
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is B) "Added by decorator" and "Added by metaclass".

Explanation:
- The `decorator` function is applied to the `MyClass`, which adds a new attribute `new_attr` to the class.
- The `Meta` metaclass also modifies the class by adding another attribute `from_meta`.
- When we print these attributes, they are correctly set and returned as expected.
