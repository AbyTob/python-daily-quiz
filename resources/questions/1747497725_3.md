    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data fetched"

class FetchDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result

@FetchDecorator
async def get_data():
    data = await fetch_data()
    return data

# Run the decorated coroutine
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(get_data())
print(result)
```

Which of the following statements about the provided code is true?

A) The `@FetchDecorator` decorator will not print any timing information.

B) The `get_data()` function will run synchronously and block the event loop.

C) The `@FetchDecorator` measures the time taken by `fetch_data()` and prints it out.

D) The `@FetchDecorator` is designed to work with synchronous functions only.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**C) The @FetchDecorator measures the time taken by fetch_data() and prints it out.**

Explanation:

The provided code defines a coroutine `get_data()` that uses another coroutine `fetch_data()`. The decorator `FetchDecorator` is applied to `get_data()`, which adds timing functionality around its execution.

When `get_data()` is called, it wraps the call to `fetch_data()` with timing logic. Inside the `__call__` method of the decorator, the start time is recorded before calling the decorated function (`self.func`). After the function returns, the end time is recorded, and the difference (time taken) is printed out.

This allows you to measure and print how long it takes for `fetch_data()` to execute, which demonstrates that the decorator works correctly with asynchronous functions.
