    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to cache results of function calls:

```python
def cache(func):
    cache_dict = {}
    
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in cache_dict:
            cache_dict[args] = func(*args)
        return cache_dict[args]
    
    return wrapper

@cache
def expensive_computation(x):
    print(f"Computing {x}...")
    return x * x

# Usage
print(expensive_computation(5))  # Computes and caches the result
print(expensive_computation(5))  # Retrieves cached result without recomputing
```

Which of the following statements is true about this implementation?

A) The cache dictionary is created each time the `cache` decorator is applied.
B) The `wrapper` function maintains the state of the cache across multiple calls.
C) The `expensive_computation` function is not called if its result is in the cache.
D) All arguments passed to `expensive_computation` must be hashable for caching.
    
    ## Answer
    [C] The `expensive_computation` function is not called if its result is in the cache.
