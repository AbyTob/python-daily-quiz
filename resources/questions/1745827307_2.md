    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses metaclasses and decorators:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'greet' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Missing greet method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def greeting_decorator(cls):
    original_greet = cls.greet

    def new_greet(self):
        print(f"Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}")
        original_greet(self)
    
    cls.greet = new_greet
    return cls

@greeting_decorator
class Person(metaclass=Meta):
    def greet(self):
        print("I am a person")

person = Person()
person.greet()
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code? Select all correct answers:

A) The metaclass `Meta` checks if the subclass has a `greet` method before allowing it to be instantiated.
B) The `greeting_decorator` modifies the `greet` method of any class it decorates, adding a greeting message at the beginning.
C) When `person.greet()` is called, it will first print "Hello from Person" and then "I am a person".
D) Both A and B are correct.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] D

Explanation:
A) The metaclass `Meta` correctly checks if the subclass has a `greet` method. If not, it raises a `TypeError`, which is true.
B) The `greeting_decorator` correctly modifies the `greet` method by adding a greeting message at the beginning, which is also true.
C) Both A and B are correct because they both accurately describe aspects of how the code works.
D) This answer is correct as it correctly identifies both parts A and B as being true.
