# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses both a metaclass and a decorator to enhance a class's behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['meta_attribute'] = 'set by metaclass'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def my_decorator(cls):
    cls.decorated_attribute = 'set by decorator'
    return cls

@my_decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass
```

What will be the output of `print(MyClass.meta_attribute)` and `print(MyClass.decorated_attribute)`?

A) meta_attribute: set by metaclass, decorated_attribute: set by decorator  
B) AttributeError for both  
C) meta_attribute: None, decorated_attribute: set by decorator  
D) None, None
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) meta_attribute: set by metaclass, decorated_attribute: set by decorator

Explanation:
- The `Meta` metaclass is invoked during the creation of `MyClass`. It adds an attribute `meta_attribute` to the class with the value 'set by metaclass'.
- The `my_decorator` function is applied to `MyClass` after its creation. This function adds another attribute `decorated_attribute` to `MyClass` with the value 'set by decorator'.

Thus, both attributes are successfully added to `MyClass`, and accessing them through `print(MyClass.meta_attribute)` and `print(MyClass.decorated_attribute)` will output their respective values.
