    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return await self.func(*args, **kwargs)

@AsyncDecorator
async def my_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Function executed")

# Usage
asyncio.run(my_async_function())
```

What is the purpose of the `AsyncDecorator` class in this code? How does it work with the `my_async_function`?

A) It synchronizes multiple asynchronous functions.
B) It converts synchronous functions into asynchronous ones by wrapping them in a coroutine.
C) It manages the execution order of asynchronous tasks.
D) It optimizes memory usage during asynchronous operations.
    
    ## Answer
    B) It converts synchronous functions into asynchronous ones by wrapping them in a coroutine.
