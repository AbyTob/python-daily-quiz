    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure all instances of a class have a unique identifier.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class UniqueIdentifierMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[instance.identifier] = instance
        return cls._instances.get(instance.identifier)

class UniqueID(ABC, metaclass=UniqueIdentifierMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def identifier(self) -> str:
        pass

class User(UniqueID):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
    
    @property
    def identifier(self) -> str:
        return self.name

# Example usage:
user1 = User("Alice")
user2 = User("Bob")
print(user1 is user2)  # Should print True if the metaclass works correctly
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes how the `UniqueIdentifierMeta` metaclass ensures that all instances of a subclass of `UniqueID` have unique identifiers?

A) It uses a class variable `_instances` to store instances, ensuring each identifier is used only once.

B) It overrides the `__new__` method to create a new instance and add it to the `_instances` dictionary.

C) It overrides the `__call__` method to check if an instance with the same identifier already exists; if so, it returns the existing instance, otherwise, it creates a new one.

D) It uses a static method to register each instance when it is created and checks for duplicates in the `_instances` dictionary before allowing a new instance.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) It overrides the `__call__` method to check if an instance with the same identifier already exists; if so, it returns the existing instance, otherwise, it creates a new one.

Explanation: The `UniqueIdentifierMeta` metaclass overrides the `__call__` method. This special method is called when an instance of the metaclass is invoked as a function (i.e., when a class is instantiated). The `__call__` method checks if there's already an instance with the same identifier in the `_instances` dictionary. If such an instance exists, it returns that existing instance instead of creating a new one. This ensures that all instances of subclasses of `UniqueID` have unique identifiers, as required by the abstract method `identifier`.
