    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a Python library that manages database connections. The library should support both synchronous and asynchronous operations and be able to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently. 

To achieve this, you decide to use metaclasses and async/await to create a flexible and performant solution.

1. Implement a metaclass `ConnectionMeta` that ensures each connection is unique within the application.
2. Create an asynchronous context manager `AsyncConnectionManager` that manages asynchronous database connections using a pool of connections.
3. Provide a synchronous context manager `SyncConnectionManager` for managing synchronous connections in a thread-safe manner.

Here's a basic structure to get you started:

```python
import asyncio
from collections import deque
import threading

# Define the ConnectionMeta metaclass here
class ConnectionMeta(type):
    pass

# Implement the AsyncConnectionManager class here
class AsyncConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self, pool_size: int):
        self.pool = deque(maxlen=pool_size)
        # Initialize your connection pool here
    
    async def acquire(self):
        if not self.pool:
            raise ConnectionError("No available connections")
        return await asyncio.get_running_loop().run_in_executor(None, self._acquire_sync)
    
    def release(self, connection):
        self.pool.append(connection)

    def _acquire_sync(self):
        # Synchronous logic to acquire a connection
        pass

# Implement the SyncConnectionManager class here
class SyncConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self, pool_size: int):
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        self.pool = deque(maxlen=pool_size)
    
    def acquire(self):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.pool:
                raise ConnectionError("No available connections")
            return self._acquire_sync()
    
    def release(self, connection):
        with self.lock:
            self.pool.append(connection)

    def _acquire_sync(self):
        # Synchronous logic to acquire a connection
        pass
```

Which of the following statements correctly implements the required functionality?

A) The `ConnectionMeta` metaclass does not need any implementation as it is just a placeholder.
B) The `AsyncConnectionManager` and `SyncConnectionManager` classes should both have their `_acquire_sync` methods implemented to handle connection acquisition in a thread-safe manner for synchronous connections.
C) The `AsyncConnectionManager` should use a lock to ensure thread safety when acquiring connections, as it is managing asynchronous connections.
D) The `SyncConnectionManager` should use an asyncio loop to run synchronous logic in the background.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
B) The `AsyncConnectionManager` and `SyncConnectionManager` classes should both have their `_acquire_sync` methods implemented to handle connection acquisition in a thread-safe manner for synchronous connections.

Explanation:
- The `ConnectionMeta` metaclass is essential for ensuring that each connection is unique, which can be achieved using a combination of class attributes and object initialization within the metaclass.
- For the `AsyncConnectionManager`, it should manage asynchronous connections without blocking the event loop, so it doesn't need to use locks. Instead, it can use thread-safe data structures provided by asyncio or standard library functions that are compatible with async operations.
- The `SyncConnectionManager` requires a lock in its `_acquire_sync` method to ensure that multiple threads do not interfere when accessing the connection pool simultaneously.
- Therefore, option B is the correct implementation as it correctly identifies that both classes need their synchronous logic methods implemented for thread safety and proper management of connections.
