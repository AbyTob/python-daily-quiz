    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add a custom method to all classes it decorates. The goal is to create a new class attribute `total_instances` that keeps track of how many instances have been created for each class.

```python
class InstanceTrackerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['total_instances'] = 0
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        cls.total_instances += 1
        return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

@InstanceTrackerMeta()
class MyClass:
    pass

obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(MyClass.total_instances)  # Expected output: 2
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes why `MyClass.total_instances` equals 2?

A) The metaclass is not working because it does not track instances correctly.

B) The metaclass is working as intended, and each time an instance of MyClass is created, the `total_instances` attribute is incremented.

C) The class decorator should be applied directly to the class definition rather than using a metaclass.

D) The use of a metaclass for this purpose is unnecessary; a simpler approach with a class variable would suffice.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The metaclass is working as intended, and each time an instance of MyClass is created, the `total_instances` attribute is incremented.

Explanation: In the provided code, `InstanceTrackerMeta` is a metaclass that adds a `total_instances` class attribute to any class it decorates. When an instance of a decorated class is created, the `__call__` method of the metaclass increments this `total_instances` attribute. Since two instances (`obj1` and `obj2`) are created from `MyClass`, `MyClass.total_instances` correctly equals 2, demonstrating that the metaclass is functioning as intended to track instance counts.
