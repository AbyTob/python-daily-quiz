    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import time

def timed(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimeTracker:
    __instances = {}

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls not in cls.__instances:
            instance = super().__new__(cls)
            cls.__instances[cls] = instance
            return instance
        else:
            return cls.__instances[cls]

    @timed
    def add(self, a, b):
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate a time-consuming task
        return a + b

def main():
    tracker = TimeTracker()
    result1 = tracker.add(3, 4)
    result2 = tracker.add(5, 6)
    print(f"Result 1: {result1}, Result 2: {result2}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

What is the output of this code and why?

A) Result 1: 7.0, Result 2: 11.0  
B) Result 1: 7.0, Result 2: 11.0 (Both calls to add take 0.5 seconds)  
C) Result 1: 7.0, Result 2: 11.0 (First call takes 0.5 seconds, second takes 1.0 seconds)  
D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    Answer: B

Explanation:
The output is Result 1: 7.0, Result 2: 11.0 (Both calls to add take 0.5 seconds).

- The `timed` decorator measures and prints the time taken by any function it decorates.
- The `TimeTracker` class uses a singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of `TimeTracker` is created and reused.
- Since both method calls in `main()` use the same instance of `TimeTracker`, the `add` method takes 0.5 seconds for each call, as it simulates a time-consuming task with `time.sleep(0.5)`. The decorator does not cache results or re-run methods; it simply measures the execution time of the method each time it is called.
- Therefore, both calls to `tracker.add` take 0.5 seconds, making option B the correct answer.
