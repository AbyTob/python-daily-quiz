# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add a new attribute `new_attr` to any class it decorates. However, there's a twist in how this is intended to work.

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'new_attr' not in dct:
            dct['new_attr'] = "default_value"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta()
class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.new_attr)
```

This code attempts to automatically add an attribute `new_attr` with a default value of `"default_value"` to any class decorated by the metaclass `Meta`. However, it's not working as expected.

**Question:** Why is `obj.new_attr` not being set to `"default_value"` as intended? What can be done to fix this issue?

A) The metaclass is not correctly adding the attribute because it is being called before any attributes are defined in the class.
B) The metaclass is incorrectly overriding an existing attribute with the same name, but there isn't one.
C) The attribute assignment should happen during the initialization of each instance instead of during the class creation.
D) There is no issue; `obj.new_attr` will be set to `"default_value"` after running this code.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**A) The metaclass is not correctly adding the attribute because it is being called before any attributes are defined in the class.**

This option is incorrect because the metaclass is actually trying to add `new_attr` when no other attributes exist, which is its intended behavior.

**B) The metaclass is incorrectly overriding an existing attribute with the same name, but there isn't one.**

This option is also incorrect for the same reason as A; there is no conflicting attribute in this case.

**C) The attribute assignment should happen during the initialization of each instance instead of during the class creation.**

This option is correct. The issue arises because the metaclass adds `new_attr` when the class is created, but if an instance-specific value needs to be set, it must be done during the initialization of that instance.

**D) There is no issue; `obj.new_attr` will be set to `"default_value"` after running this code.**

This option is incorrect because, as explained in option C, the attribute assignment should happen during instance creation, not class creation.

The correct fix involves ensuring that any additional attributes are assigned within an `__init__` method if they need to vary per instance or conditionally.
