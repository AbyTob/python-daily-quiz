# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses together:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'my_method' not in dct:
            raise AttributeError(f"{name} must define a method named 'my_method'")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@my_decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def my_method(self):
        print("Hello from my_method!")
```

When you run the following code:

```python
obj = MyClass()
obj.my_method()
```

Which of the following will be printed?

A) Something is happening before the function is called.
   Hello from my_method!
   Something is happening after the function is called.

B) AttributeError: MyClass must define a method named 'my_method'

C) Something is happening before the function is called.
   AttributeError: MyClass must define a method named 'my_method'
   Something is happening after the function is called.

D) TypeError: __call__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer):
A) Something is happening before the function is called.
   Hello from my_method!
   Something is happening after the function is called.

**Explanation:** The code defines a decorator `my_decorator` that adds pre and post-function call messages. It also defines a metaclass `Meta` that checks if any class using it defines a method named `my_method`. The class `MyClass` uses both the decorator and metaclass, and implements the required method. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and `my_method` is called, all messages are printed as expected.
