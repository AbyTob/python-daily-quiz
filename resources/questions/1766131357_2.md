    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question):

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class. A singleton is a design pattern where a class can only be instantiated once.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class SingletonClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Example usage
instance1 = SingletonClass()
instance2 = SingletonClass()

print(instance1 is instance2)  # Output will be True if the code is correct
```

Which of the following statements about the above code is true?

A) The `SingletonClass` can be instantiated multiple times without any issues.

B) The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `SingletonClass` exists, and subsequent instantiation attempts return the same object.

C) The `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` is not necessary for creating a singleton class.

D) The `instance1` and `instance2` variables will point to different instances of `SingletonClass`.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer):

B) The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `SingletonClass` exists, and subsequent instantiation attempts return the same object.

Explanation:
The code provided uses a metaclass called `SingletonMeta` to ensure that the `SingletonClass` can be instantiated only once. When an instance of `SingletonClass` is created, the `__call__` method of the metaclass checks if an instance already exists in the `_instances` dictionary. If it does, it returns the existing instance; otherwise, it creates a new one and stores it in the dictionary. This guarantees that all references to `SingletonClass` will point to the same object. Therefore, the statement B is correct.

Options A, C, and D are incorrect because:
- Option A: The code ensures only one instance exists.
- Option C: The `__call__` method is essential for ensuring that only one instance is created.
- Option D: Due to the singleton pattern, `instance1` and `instance2` will indeed point to the same object.
