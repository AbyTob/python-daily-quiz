    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Method is being called")
        return self.func(*args, **kwargs)

def class_decorator(cls):
    class NewClass(cls):
        def new_method(self):
            print("New method added by decorator")
    
    return NewClass

@class_decorator
class MyClass:
    @MethodDecorator
    def my_method(self):
        print("Original method")
