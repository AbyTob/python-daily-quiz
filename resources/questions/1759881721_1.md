    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators, metaclasses, and asyncio:

```python
import asyncio

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        async def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
            print("Creating instance of", name)
            return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        dct['__call__'] = __call__
        return type.__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

@MyClass
async def my_coroutine():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Coroutine done")

# Create an instance of MyClass and run the coroutine
async def main():
    inst = MyClass()
    await my_coroutine()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `MyClass` will raise a TypeError when trying to create an instance because it is not callable.
B) The `my_coroutine` function will execute immediately after its definition.
C) When creating an instance of `MyClass`, the string "Creating instance of MyClass" will be printed before the instance is returned.
D) The `my_coroutine` coroutine will not be awaited in the `main` function.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**C) When creating an instance of `MyClass`, the string "Creating instance of MyClass" will be printed before the instance is returned.**

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` dynamically defines a new `__call__` method for any class that uses it as its metaclass.
- This new `__call__` method is responsible for printing the creation message when an instance is created.
- In the given code, since `MyClass` uses `Meta` as its metaclass, calling `MyClass()` will invoke this dynamically defined `__call__` method, printing "Creating instance of MyClass" before the actual instantiation occurs.
