    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators, metaclasses, and context managers:

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = log_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class MyClass:
    def method1(self):
        print("Executing method1")

    def method2(self, a, b):
        print(f"Executing method2 with {a} and {b}")

with MyClass() as obj:
    obj.method1()
    obj.method2(3, 4)
```

What will be the output of this code? Explain why.

A) 
```
Calling __init__ with args: (), kwargs: {}
Calling method1 with args: (), kwargs: {}
Executing method1
Calling method2 with args: (3,), kwargs: {'b': 4}
Executing method2 with 3 and 4
```

B) 
```
Calling method1 with args: (), kwargs: {}
Executing method1
Calling method2 with args: (3,), kwargs: {'b': 4}
Executing method2 with 3 and 4
```

C) 
```
Calling __init__ with args: (), kwargs: {}
Calling method1 with args: (), kwargs: {}
Executing method1
Calling method2 with args: (3,), kwargs: {'b': 4}
Calling method2 with args: (3,), kwargs: {'b': 4}
Executing method2 with 3 and 4
```

D) 
```
AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute '__init__'
```
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The code uses a metaclass (`Meta`) to automatically decorate all callable attributes of the class it creates with the `log_decorator`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created using the context manager, the `__init__` method is not explicitly defined in the class. Since Python's default behavior for creating instances involves calling `__new__` and then `__init__`, but there's no explicit `__init__`, the metaclass does not add a logging decorator to it.

Therefore, when `obj.method1()` and `obj.method2(3, 4)` are called inside the context manager block:
- The `method1` is decorated with `log_decorator`, so it logs its call before executing.
- The `method2` is also decorated with `log_decorator`, logging its call before executing.

This results in the output:

```
Calling method1 with args: (), kwargs: {}
Executing method1
Calling method2 with args: (3,), kwargs: {'b': 4}
Executing method2 with 3 and 4
```
