    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate a delay
    return "Data fetched"

class AsyncLogger:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        print("Logging started")
        return self
    
    async def log(self, message):
        print(f"Log: {message}")
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb):
        print("Logging ended")

async def process_data():
    async with AsyncLogger() as logger:
        data = await fetch_data()
        await logger.log(data)
        return data

# Usage
result = asyncio.run(process_data())
print(f"Processed result: {result}")
```

Which of the following statements is true about the above code?

A) The `fetch_data` function will run synchronously because it uses `async def`.

B) The `process_data` function will execute the `fetch_data` and `log` methods concurrently.

C) The `AsyncLogger` class implements asynchronous context management using `__aenter__`, `log`, and `__aexit__`.

D) The `result` variable will contain the string "Processed result: Data fetched".
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)
**Correct Answer:** C

**Detailed Explanation:** 
- **Statement A is incorrect**: While `fetch_data` is defined with `async def`, it does not execute asynchronously unless called within an asynchronous context. The coroutine nature of `fetch_data` means it can pause execution at the `await asyncio.sleep(2)` line, but it won't run until scheduled in an event loop.
- **Statement B is incorrect**: Asynchronous operations like calling a coroutine (e.g., `fetch_data()`) will not execute concurrently within a single thread unless explicitly managed using features like `asyncio.create_task` or scheduling them in different tasks. In the given code, `await fetch_data()` and `await logger.log(data)` are sequential, not concurrent.
- **Statement C is correct**: The `AsyncLogger` class correctly implements asynchronous context management by defining the methods `__aenter__`, `log`, and `__aexit__`. This allows the class to manage resources asynchronously when used with `async with`.
- **Statement D is incorrect**: The value of `result` will be the data returned by `fetch_data()`, which is "Data fetched". Therefore, `result` will not contain "Processed result: Data fetched"; it will simply contain "Data fetched".

This question tests the understanding of asynchronous programming in Python, specifically the use of coroutines and context managers for resource management.
