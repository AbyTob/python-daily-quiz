    ## Question
    [QUESTION] 
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a singleton class using decorators:

```python
def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    return get_instance

@singleton
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self, db_url):
        self.db_url = db_url
```

What is the primary issue with this implementation of a singleton class using a decorator?

A) The `instances` dictionary is not thread-safe.

B) The `get_instance` function does not handle exceptions properly.

C) Multiple instances can be created by passing different arguments to `DatabaseConnection`.

D) The `singleton` decorator does not allow subclassing the decorated class.
    
    ## Answer
    [C] Multiple instances can be created by passing different arguments to `DatabaseConnection`.
