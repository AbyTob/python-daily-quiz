    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a metaclass to modify class behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Modify or add attributes to the class dynamically
        dct['additional_attribute'] = 'This is an additional attribute'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.additional_attribute)
```

**Which of the following statements about the code above is true?**

A) When `MyClass` is instantiated, it will have an attribute called `additional_attribute` with the value `'This is an additional attribute'`.

B) The metaclass `Meta` does not affect the class `MyClass` because no changes are made to its attributes.

C) Attempting to instantiate `MyClass` will raise an error due to a missing attribute in the metaclass definition.

D) None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**A)** When `MyClass` is instantiated, it will have an attribute called `additional_attribute` with the value `'This is an additional attribute'`.

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` is defined to dynamically add an attribute named `additional_attribute` to any class that uses it as its metaclass. When `MyClass` is created using `Meta`, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called, and it adds the specified attribute to `MyClass`. Therefore, when an instance of `MyClass` is created and the `additional_attribute` is accessed, it returns the expected value.
