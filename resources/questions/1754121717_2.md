# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a combination of metaclasses and class decorators to enhance the behavior of a simple class:

```python
from functools import wraps

# Metaclass to add an attribute
class AddAttributeMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['additional_attribute'] = 'This is an additional attribute'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Class decorator to modify a method
def modify_method(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Method modified")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@AddAttributeMeta
class MyClass:
    def my_method(self):
        print("Original Method")

# Usage
my_instance = MyClass()
print(my_instance.additional_attribute)  # Output: This is an additional attribute
my_instance.my_method()  # Output: Method modified
                           #         Original Method
```

What will be the output when running the following code snippet?

```python
my_instance = MyClass()
print(my_instance.additional_attribute)
my_instance.my_method()
```

A) AttributeError  
B) This is an additional attribute  
   Method modified  
   Original Method  

C) This is an additional attribute  
   Original Method  

D) Error in metaclass definition
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**Answer: B) This is an additional attribute  
Method modified  
Original Method**

**Explanation:**  
- The `AddAttributeMeta` metaclass adds an attribute named `additional_attribute` to any class it decorates. When we create an instance of `MyClass`, this attribute is accessible, and its value is printed as "This is an additional attribute".
- The `modify_method` decorator modifies the behavior of any method it decorates by printing a message before executing the original method. Therefore, when `my_instance.my_method()` is called, it first prints "Method modified" and then proceeds to execute the original method, which prints "Original Method".
