    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to measure the execution time of a function:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    """Computes the sum of numbers from 1 to n."""
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        total += i
    return total

print(compute_sum(1000000))
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when the `compute_sum` function is called with an argument of 1 million?

A) The execution time of `compute_sum` will be printed to the console and then the sum of numbers from 1 to 1 million will be returned.

B) Only the sum of numbers from 1 to 1 million will be returned without any output indicating execution time.

C) An error will occur because decorators cannot be used with functions that have docstrings.

D) The function will execute normally without any modification due to the decorator.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The execution time of `compute_sum` will be printed to the console and then the sum of numbers from 1 to 1 million will be returned.
