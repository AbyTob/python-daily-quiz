    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Before calling function")
        result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After calling function")
        return result

@AsyncDecorator
async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data fetched"

async def main():
    data = await fetch_data()
    print(data)

# Run the event loop to execute the code
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and execution flow of this code?

A) The `AsyncDecorator` class is a metaclass that modifies the behavior of the `fetch_data` method.

B) When `main()` is called, it directly executes the `fetch_data` function without any additional output before or after its call.

C) The `AsyncDecorator` class defines an asynchronous call to the original function, and when `main()` is executed, it prints "Before calling function", waits for 1 second, then prints "After calling function" followed by "Data fetched".

D) There is a syntax error in the code because decorators cannot be used on asynchronous functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C

The correct answer is C. Here's why:

- The `AsyncDecorator` class takes an asynchronous function as an argument during initialization.
- When `fetch_data` is called with the `@AsyncDecorator`, it replaces `fetch_data` with a new callable object that includes additional print statements before and after calling the original `fetch_data`.
- In the `main()` function, when `await fetch_data()` is executed, it triggers the asynchronous call to `fetch_data`, which includes the print statement inside the decorator.
- Thus, the output of this code will be:
  ```
  Before calling function
  Data fetched
  After calling function
  ```

This demonstrates how decorators can modify the behavior of both synchronous and asynchronous functions effectively.
