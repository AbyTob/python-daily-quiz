# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'greet' not in dct:
            dct['greet'] = lambda self: "Hello, I am an instance of {}.".format(name)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Example usage
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.greet())
```

What happens if you add a method `greet` directly to the class definition before creating an instance? How would this affect the output of `obj.greet()`?

A) The output remains "Hello, I am an instance of MyClass."

B) The output changes to "Hello, World!" because the metaclass no longer adds a default greet method.

C) A TypeError is raised because `greet` conflicts with the metaclass's behavior.

D) No output is generated; the method does not get invoked at all.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) The output remains "Hello, I am an instance of MyClass."

Explanation: When a class is defined with a metaclass like `Meta`, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called to create the class. If the method `greet` is not explicitly defined in the class dictionary, the metaclass provides a default implementation. Once the class is created, any subsequent changes to its dictionary, such as adding a method after the class has been instantiated, do not affect the methods already added by the metaclass during the creation of the class. Therefore, calling `obj.greet()` will still use the default greet method provided by the metaclass.
