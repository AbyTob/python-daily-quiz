    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.start_time = None

    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        elapsed_time = time.time() - self.start_time
        print(f"Elapsed Time: {elapsed_time:.4f} seconds")

async def main():
    async with Timer():
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `Timer` class cannot be used in an asynchronous context.
B) The `Timer` class is designed to measure the time taken by synchronous functions only.
C) The `Timer` class accurately measures the time taken by both synchronous and asynchronous operations within its `async with` block.
D) The `Timer` class is not thread-safe.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] C) The `Timer` class accurately measures the time taken by both synchronous and asynchronous operations within its `async with` block.

**Explanation:**
- The `Timer` class uses Python's `asyncio.sleep()` in its `main()` function, which is an asynchronous operation. 
- The `Timer` class defines both `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods, making it a context manager that works with the `async with` statement.
- When using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`, Python's event loop is not blocked, allowing other tasks to run concurrently. This demonstrates that the `Timer` class can accurately measure both synchronous (like time.sleep) and asynchronous operations.
- The example correctly shows how to use an asynchronous context manager (`async with`) with a function that involves asynchronous sleep, making option C the correct answer.
