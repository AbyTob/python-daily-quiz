    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
Consider the following Python code that uses decorators and metaclasses:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Function called")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 42

# Create an instance of MyClass
obj = MyClass()
```

What will be the output when you run this code? Explain why each line is printed.

### Part 2 (Answer)
**
    
    ## Answer
    C**

**Explanation:** 
1. `Creating class MyClass` - This line is printed because the metaclass `Meta` is called to create the class `MyClass`. The `__new__` method of the metaclass is invoked when a new class is being created, and in this case, it prints "Creating class MyClass".
2. `Function called` - This line is printed when an instance of `MyClass` is created. Since `MyClass` is decorated with `@my_decorator`, calling any method on its instances (even the constructor) will trigger the decorator. In this specific code, when you create an instance (`obj = MyClass()`), it triggers the decorator's wrapper function, which prints "Function called".

The metaclass provides a way to intercept and modify class creation, while decorators allow for adding additional functionality to methods or classes in a clean and reusable way. This combination is useful for tasks like logging, access control, and more.
