    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print("Before calling function")
            result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
            print("After calling function")
            return result
        return wrapper

@AsyncDecorator
async def my_async_function():
    print("Inside my_async_function")

async def main():
    await my_async_function()

# Run the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when `my_async_function` is called?

A) The function prints "Before calling function" and then executes its body, followed by "After calling function".

B) The function directly prints "Inside my_async_function" without any additional messages.

C) An error occurs because `AsyncDecorator` cannot be used with an asynchronous function.

D) The program enters an infinite loop due to the use of decorators and asyncio.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The function prints "Before calling function" and then executes its body, followed by "After calling function".

Explanation:
- The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator is applied to `my_async_function`.
- When `my_async_function` is called within the `main` coroutine, it goes through the decorator.
- Inside the decorator, a new asynchronous wrapper function (`wrapper`) is created and returned.
- When `await my_async_function()` is executed in `main`, the actual function call happens inside this wrapper.
- The wrapper first prints "Before calling function", then calls the original async function, which executes its body printing "Inside my_async_function", and finally prints "After calling function".
