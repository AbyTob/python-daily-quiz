    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses a decorator to cache the results of a function. The goal is to understand how decorators can be used for performance optimization.

```python
import time

def cache_results(func):
    cache = {}
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        key = args + tuple(kwargs.items())
        if key not in cache:
            print("Computing new result")
            cache[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            print("Returning cached result")
        return cache[key]
    return wrapper

@cache_results
def expensive_function(x):
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate an expensive computation
    return x * 2

# Usage example
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should compute new result and then use cache
print(expensive_function(5))  # Should use cached result
```

Which of the following statements is true about the `cache_results` decorator?

A) It increases the memory footprint of the application by storing all results in memory.
B) It optimizes performance by avoiding redundant computations for function calls with the same arguments.
C) It will cause a runtime error because the cache dictionary is not thread-safe.
D) It decreases the execution time by automatically parallelizing the function calls.
    
    ## Answer
    [B] The `cache_results` decorator increases the performance of the application by avoiding redundant computations. This is achieved by storing the results of expensive function calls in a cache, which allows the function to return immediately from the cache for subsequent calls with the same arguments, thus saving time and resources.
