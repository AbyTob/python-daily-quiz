    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a combination of decorators, metaclasses, and context managers. The goal is to create a decorator that logs method calls for instances created by a specific metaclass. Additionally, the context manager should ensure that all instances are properly cleaned up when exiting the context.

```python
from typing import Any, Callable

def log_calls(cls):
    class DecoratedClass:
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.instance = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        
        def __getattr__(self, name):
            original_attr = getattr(self.instance, name)
            
            if callable(original_attr):
                def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                    print(f"Calling {name} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
                    return original_attr(*args, **kwargs)
                return wrapper
            else:
                return original_attr
    return DecoratedClass

class Meta(type):
    @classmethod
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = log_calls(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def method1(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        return a + b

with context_manager(MyClass) as instance:
    result = instance.method1(5, 3)
    print(result)
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior of this code when run in a Python environment?

A) The decorator `log_calls` will log all method calls made to instances of `MyClass`, and the context manager will ensure that no instances are left behind.

B) The decorator `log_calls` will not affect the methods defined in `MyClass`, as metaclasses handle method wrapping differently.

C) The context manager `context_manager` is used correctly to create an instance of `MyClass`.

D) Instances created by `MyClass` will not have their method calls logged due to a misconfiguration in the decorator.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) The decorator `log_calls` will log all method calls made to instances of `MyClass`, and the context manager will ensure that no instances are left behind.

Explanation: The `log_calls` decorator wraps each callable attribute of an instance, printing its name and arguments when called. Since it's applied via a metaclass, it effectively decorates all methods defined in any class created with this metaclass. Additionally, if a context manager is implemented correctly (which is not provided here), it would handle the creation and cleanup of instances properly.
