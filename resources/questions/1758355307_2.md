    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method dynamically to a class during its creation. Your task is to understand how this works and answer the subsequent questions related to it.

```python
# Define a metaclass
class AddMethod(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: "This method was added dynamically"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Apply the metaclass to a base class
class BaseClass(metaclass=AddMethod):
    pass

# Instantiate and use the instance
instance = BaseClass()
print(instance.dynamic_method())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the code above?

A) The `dynamic_method` is added to instances of `BaseClass` at runtime, not during class creation.

B) When an instance of `BaseClass` is created, the `dynamic_method` is dynamically added to that specific instance's dictionary.

C) The metaclass `AddMethod` is invoked whenever a new class is created that inherits from `BaseClass`.

D) The code will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot be applied to base classes.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] A) The `dynamic_method` is added to instances of `BaseClass` at runtime, not during class creation.

Explanation: In Python, metaclasses are called when a new class is created. They allow you to intercept and customize the class creation process. In this example, the `AddMethod` metaclass modifies the dictionary (`dct`) that will become the class attributes by adding the `dynamic_method`. This method is then available on all instances of `BaseClass`, not just at runtime but as soon as the class itself is created.
