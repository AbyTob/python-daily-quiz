    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_task():
    print("Task started")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Task completed")

class TaskDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.func(*args, **kwargs)

@TaskDecorator
async def decorated_async_task():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Decorated task completed")

async def main():
    tasks = [async_task(), decorated_async_task()]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this script when executed?

A) Task started  
   Decorated task completed  
   Task completed  

B) Task started  
   Task completed  
   Decorated task completed  

C) Error: Tasks cannot be decorated with `@TaskDecorator` because they are coroutines.  

D) Task started  
   Task completed

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Task started  
   Decorated task completed  
   Task completed  

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is A. The `TaskDecorator` class can be used to decorate both regular synchronous functions and asynchronous coroutines in Python. When you use the decorator on an async function, it simply calls the original function without any modification since the decorator does not perform any actions that would conflict with the async nature of the coroutine.

The output will be:

```
Task started
Decorated task completed
Task completed
```

This demonstrates that decorators work seamlessly with both synchronous and asynchronous functions in Python.
