    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a class factory:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name in ['method1', 'method2']:
            if attr_name not in dct:
                raise AttributeError(f"{name} must have {attr_name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Using the class factory
obj = MyClass()
```

Which of the following statements is true about the above code?

A) The `MyClass` will be instantiated without any errors.
B) An AttributeError will be raised because `method1` and `method2` are missing from the class.
C) The metaclass `Meta` will not have any effect on the creation of `MyClass`.
D) The instantiation of `obj = MyClass()` will take significantly longer than usual due to the overhead of the metaclass.
    
    ## Answer
    B) An AttributeError will be raised because `method1` and `method2` are missing from the class.

Explanation: In the provided code, the metaclass `Meta` checks for the presence of `method1` and `method2` in any subclass it creates. Since these methods are not defined in `MyClass`, when an instance is attempted to be created, an AttributeError will be raised indicating that "MyClass must have method1" or "MyClass must have method2". The metaclass plays a role in ensuring that the required attributes are present before allowing class instantiation, thus preventing issues at runtime.
