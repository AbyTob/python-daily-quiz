**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator and metaclass together:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'greet' not in dct:
            raise TypeError(f"{name} must implement greet method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class Greeter(metaclass=Meta):
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello")

class FriendlyGreeter(Greeter):
    pass

def greet_decorator(cls):
    original_greet = cls.greet
    
    def new_greet(self):
        print("Greetings!")
        original_greet(self)
    
    cls.greet = new_greet
    return cls

@Meta
@greet_decorator
class WelcomeGreeter(Greeter):
    def greet(self):
        print("Welcome!")

f1 = Greeter()
f2 = FriendlyGreeter()
w = WelcomeGreeter()

# What will be the output of the following code?
print(f1.greet())
print(f2.greet())
print(w.greet())
```

What is the output of the above code? Select all that apply.

A) AttributeError: 'FriendlyGreeter' object has no attribute 'greet'

B) Greetings! Hello

C) Welcome!

D) TypeError: Greeter must implement greet method

**Part 2 (Answer):**

D) TypeError: Greeter must implement greet method

Explanation:

- The `Meta` metaclass checks if the `greet` method is implemented in any class that uses it. Since `Greeter` and `FriendlyGreeter` do not have a `greet` method, they would raise a `TypeError`. However, due to the decorator `@greet_decorator`, `Greeter` gets an additional `greet` method that prints "Greetings!" before calling the original `greet` method.
- The `WelcomeGreeter` class uses both the metaclass and the decorator. When `WelcomeGreeter` is instantiated, the `Meta` metaclass checks for the presence of a `greet` method, which does not exist in this case. Therefore, it raises a `TypeError`.
- Since the metaclass check fails before the decorator can be applied to `WelcomeGreeter`, option B and C cannot be correct.
- Option A is incorrect because all classes have the `greet` method due to the decorator.
