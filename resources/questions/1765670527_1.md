    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to log function calls. The goal is to understand how decorators can be used to enhance functionality dynamically.

```python
def log_calls(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@log_calls
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class Calculator:
    @staticmethod
    def subtract(a, b):
        return a - b

# Create an instance of Calculator and call the methods
calc = Calculator()
result1 = calc.subtract(5, 3)
result2 = add(4, 6)

print(f"Subtraction result: {result1}")
print(f"Addition result: {result2}")
```

Which of the following statements accurately describes what happens when the code is executed?

A) Only the subtraction method call in `calc.subtract(5, 3)` will be logged.

B) Both the subtraction and addition calls will be logged.

C) The addition method call in `add(4, 6)` will not be logged because it's a static method.

D) An error will occur because decorators cannot be applied to static methods.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) Both the subtraction and addition calls will be logged.

Explanation:
- The decorator `@log_calls` is applied to both the `subtract` method of the `Calculator` class and the standalone function `add`.
- When `calc.subtract(5, 3)` is called, it triggers the decorated version of `subtract`, which logs the call.
- Similarly, when `add(4, 6)` is called, it triggers the decorated version of `add`, which also logs the call.
