    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        elapsed_time = time.time() - self.start_time
        print(f"{self.name} took {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")

def timed_function():
    with Timer("Function Execution"):
        # Simulate a task that takes some time
        time.sleep(1)

async def timed_coroutine():
    async with Timer("Coroutine Execution"):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

# Main function to run the examples
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import threading
    thread = threading.Thread(target=timed_function)
    thread.start()
    thread.join()

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(timed_coroutine())
```

What will be printed when you run this code? Choose the correct order of statements.

A) Function Execution took 1.00 seconds
   Coroutine Execution took 1.00 seconds

B) Function Execution took 1.00 seconds
   Coroutine Execution took 1.00 seconds (or close to it)

C) Function Execution took 1.00 seconds
   Coroutine Execution took a longer time than the function

D) Function Execution took 1.00 seconds
   Coroutine Execution did not print anything
    
    ## Answer
    B) Function Execution took 1.00 seconds
   Coroutine Execution took 1.00 seconds (or close to it)

Explanation:
- The `Timer` class is used as a context manager to measure the execution time of a block of code.
- When running the `timed_function`, it uses a thread to execute a blocking function (`time.sleep(1)`), so the Timer's exit method will not run immediately after entering, but when the thread finishes.
- The `timed_coroutine` is an asynchronous function that measures its execution time using the same `Timer` class. Since it is awaited in an asyncio loop, the loop will continue to process other tasks while waiting for the coroutine, so the Timer's exit method will run after a short delay (not necessarily exactly 1 second) when the coroutine completes.
- Therefore, both timers print their respective times after their associated task completes, but with some minor differences due to thread scheduling and asyncio's event loop behavior.
