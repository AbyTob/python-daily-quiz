    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import threading

class ThreadSafeDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self._dict = {}
        self._lock = threading.Lock()

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        with self._lock:
            return self._dict[key]

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        with self._lock:
            self._dict[key] = value

    def __delitem__(self, key):
        with self._lock:
            del self._dict[key]

def thread_safe_function(d: ThreadSafeDict) -> None:
    for _ in range(1000):
        d[1] = 2

def main():
    tsd = ThreadSafeDict()
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=thread_safe_function, args=(tsd,)) for _ in range(10)]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

What is the primary purpose of using a lock in the `ThreadSafeDict` class?

A) To ensure that only one thread can access the dictionary at a time, preventing race conditions.
B) To serialize output so that all data modifications are completed before printing begins.
C) To prevent memory leaks by ensuring proper deallocation of resources when objects go out of scope.
D) To improve performance by allowing multiple threads to read and write concurrently.
    
    ## Answer
    A) To ensure that only one thread can access the dictionary at a time, preventing race conditions.

Explanation: The primary purpose of using a lock in the `ThreadSafeDict` class is to prevent race conditions. Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to modify shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable and incorrect results. By acquiring a lock before accessing or modifying the dictionary, the `ThreadSafeDict` ensures that only one thread can enter the critical section of code at a time. This prevents multiple threads from interfering with each other's operations on the dictionary, ensuring its integrity and correctness.
