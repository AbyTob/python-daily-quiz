    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to measure execution time of functions. Your task is to identify what would be printed if the `calculate_sum` function is called with arguments (1, 2, 3).

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def calculate_sum(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c

print(calculate_sum(1, 2, 3))
```

A) Execution time: x seconds  
B) 6  
C) Error - decorator is incorrectly used  
D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    B) 6
