    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with optimizing the performance of a Python web server that handles many concurrent connections. The server is currently experiencing high CPU usage due to frequent context switching between threads. You decide to implement an asynchronous version using Python's `asyncio` library. 

Here's a simplified version of your current synchronous server:

```python
import socket

def handle_client(connection):
    request = connection.recv(1024)
    response = f"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Length: {len(request)}\n\n{request}".encode()
    connection.sendall(response)
    connection.close()

def run_server(host, port):
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind((host, port))
    server_socket.listen(5)
    
    while True:
        client_connection, client_address = server_socket.accept()
        handle_client(client_connection)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_server("0.0.0.0", 8080)
```

You want to modify this synchronous server to an asynchronous version using `asyncio`. However, you need to ensure that the client handling function does not block the event loop. 

Which of the following modifications correctly turns the synchronous server into an asynchronous one without blocking the event loop?

A) Replace all blocking calls with non-blocking alternatives
B) Convert the `handle_client` and `run_server` functions to use asyncio's `async` and `await`
C) Use threading or multiprocessing within the `handle_client` function to offload work
D) Implement an asynchronous context manager for handling client connections
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] B) Convert the `handle_client` and `run_server` functions to use asyncio's `async` and `await`

Explanation: 
To turn a synchronous server into an asynchronous one using Python's `asyncio`, you need to convert the blocking parts of your code into non-blocking equivalents. In this case, the blocking calls within the `handle_client` function (like `connection.recv()` and `connection.sendall()`) should be replaced with asyncio-compatible alternatives like `reader.read(1024)` and `writer.write(response)`. Additionally, you need to convert the entire server loop into an asynchronous context using `asyncio.create_task()` or `await` inside a coroutine. Option B is the correct approach as it involves both converting the blocking calls and structuring your code within an asyncio framework.
