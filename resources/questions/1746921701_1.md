# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following code snippet that attempts to create a metaclass that logs when a class is created:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Class {name} is being created")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

with MyClass() as obj:
    pass
```

What will happen when you run this code? Choose the correct option:

A) "Class MyClass is being created" will be printed, and then a TypeError will occur because `MyClass` cannot be used as a context manager.
B) "Class MyClass is being created" will be printed, and then an instance of `MyClass` will be created without any errors.
C) A NameError will occur because the `with` statement requires an object that implements the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
D) The code will not run as there is a syntax error in defining the `Meta` metaclass.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) "Class MyClass is being created" will be printed, and then a TypeError will occur because `MyClass` cannot be used as a context manager.

Explanation: The `with` statement requires that the object passed to it implements the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. Since `Meta` does not define these methods, attempting to use `MyClass` with a `with` statement results in a TypeError even though the metaclass logs the creation of the class as intended.
