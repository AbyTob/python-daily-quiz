    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class MyAsyncClass:
    async def __init__(self):
        self.data = []

    async def add_data(self, item):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        self.data.append(item)

    async def get_data(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
        return self.data.copy()

async def main():
    obj = MyAsyncClass()
    tasks = [obj.add_data(i) for i in range(5)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    result = await obj.get_data()
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `add_data` and `get_data` methods are not properly awaited when called, leading to potential race conditions.  
B) The `asyncio.sleep(0.1)` in `add_data` method ensures that the data is added sequentially without overlapping.  
C) The `get_data` method returns a copy of the list, but it still references the same objects within the list as the original.  
D) The use of `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` ensures that all tasks complete before printing the result.
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer: D)**

The use of `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` in the `main` function does indeed ensure that all tasks complete before moving on to the next line, which is where the result is printed. This guarantees that the data is fully populated when `get_data` is called.

Option A is incorrect because, although there's a slight delay with `await asyncio.sleep(0.1)`, it doesn't guarantee no race conditions if other parts of the code interact with `obj.data`. Options B and C are not accurate interpretations of the provided code.
