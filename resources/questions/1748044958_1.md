    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to automatically log any method call on an instance of a class. The goal is to understand how this works in detail.

```python
import types

class LogMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = cls.log_method_call(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def log_method_call(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            return result
        return types.MethodType(wrapper, func)

class MyClass(metaclass=LogMeta):
    def method1(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def method2(self, x):
        return x * 2
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes how to use and understand the metaclass `LogMeta` in this code?

A) The `MyClass` automatically logs all its methods when called.  
B) The `log_method_call` static method is applied to each instance method of classes that inherit from `MyClass`.  
C) The `LogMeta` only works for class attributes and not for instance methods.  
D) Any class inheriting from `MyClass` can call methods without logging because the metaclass does not affect them.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `MyClass` automatically logs all its methods when called.
This statement is incorrect. The metaclass `LogMeta` intercepts and modifies the class definition, adding a log decorator to each callable attribute (methods). However, this change affects the class itself, not individual instances.

B) The `log_method_call` static method is applied to each instance method of classes that inherit from `MyClass`.
This statement is correct. When a class inherits from `MyClass`, its methods are wrapped by the `log_method_call` decorator during the metaclass's `__new__` method execution. This means every time an instance method of any subclass is called, it will print a log message.

C) The `LogMeta` only works for class attributes and not for instance methods.
This statement is incorrect. As shown in the code, the metaclass applies to all callable attributes, including instance methods, when defining classes that use it as their metaclass.

D) Any class inheriting from `MyClass` can call methods without logging because the metaclass does not affect them.
This statement is incorrect. Due to the modification applied by the metaclass during the definition of subclasses, calling any method on an instance of a subclass will automatically include log output.
