    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to automatically add a `__len__` method to any class it decorates. The `__len__` method should return the number of attributes in the instance.

```python
class AutoLenMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Automatically add __len__ method if not already present
        if '__len__' not in dct:
            dct['__len__'] = lambda self: len(dct)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AutoLenMeta):
    a = 1
    b = 2
```

Which of the following statements is true about the `MyClass` when it is created using this metaclass?

A) The `__len__` method will return 0 because it does not count attributes.

B) The `__len__` method will raise an error because it cannot determine attribute counts dynamically.

C) The `__len__` method will return 2 because it correctly counts the instance attributes.

D) The behavior of the `MyClass` instances will be unchanged as no additional methods were added.

### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct answer: C) The `__len__` method will return 2 because it correctly counts the instance attributes.**

**Explanation:** The metaclass `AutoLenMeta` dynamically adds a `__len__` method to any class it decorates. This method returns the number of items in the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which typically includes all non-private attributes of the class (i.e., those not starting with an underscore). Therefore, when `MyClass` is created, the `__len__` method will return 2, as there are two attributes (`a` and `b`) in the `MyClass`. The lambda function used for `__len__` counts all items directly from the dictionary passed to `__new__`, which correctly reflects the number of instance attributes.
