# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1: Question**
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass and a decorator to modify the behavior of a class:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['new_method'] = lambda self: "New method added"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def add_new_method(cls):
    original_init = cls.__init__
    
    def new_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Initializing with additional features")
        original_init(self, *args, **kwargs)
    
    cls.__init__ = new_init
    return cls

@add_new_method
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Example usage:
obj = MyClass(10)
print(obj.new_method())  # Should print "New method added"
```

Which of the following statements about the above code is true?

A) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will not call the original `__init__` method.  
B) The metaclass adds a new method `new_method` to every class that uses it.  
C) The decorator modifies only the `__init__` method of the decorated class.  
D) The `new_method` added by the metaclass cannot be accessed on instances of `MyClass`.  

**Part 2: Answer**
A) is false. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will call both the modified `__init__` and the original `__init__`.

B) is true. The metaclass adds a new method `new_method` to instances of classes that use this metaclass.

C) is partially correct but incomplete. The decorator does modify only the `__init__` method of the decorated class, but it does not affect other methods defined in the original class.

D) is false. The `new_method` added by the metaclass can be accessed on instances of `MyClass`.
    
    ## Answer
    The correct answer is B) The metaclass adds a new method `new_method` to every class that uses it.
