    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class MyTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval
        self.task = None

    async def run(self):
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
            print(f"Timer ticked at {asyncio.get_event_loop().time()}")

    async def start(self):
        self.task = asyncio.create_task(self.run())

    async def stop(self):
        if self.task:
            self.task.cancel()
            try:
                await self.task
            except asyncio.CancelledError:
                pass

# Usage example
async def main():
    timer = MyTimer(5)
    await timer.start()
    await asyncio.sleep(20)
    await timer.stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the `MyTimer` class and its usage?

A) The `MyTimer` class can only be used once per instance.

B) The `start` method will raise an exception if it's called more than once on the same instance.

C) The `stop` method will ensure that the timer coroutine is fully cancelled and no further ticks are printed even if called multiple times.

D) The `run` method runs indefinitely until manually stopped, but calling `start` multiple times creates new timers without cancelling existing ones.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The `stop` method will ensure that the timer coroutine is fully cancelled and no further ticks are printed even if called multiple times.

Explanation:
- In the provided code, the `MyTimer` class has an asynchronous method `run` that prints a tick every interval.
- The `start` method creates a new task to run this coroutine in the background.
- The `stop` method cancels the task using `self.task.cancel()`, and it handles the cancellation by catching `asyncio.CancelledError`. This ensures that any remaining ticks are not printed, making the timer fully stopped.
- Option A is incorrect because instances of `MyTimer` can be reused multiple times without issues.
- Option B is incorrect because calling `start` more than once will indeed create new tasks without cancelling existing ones, which means there could be multiple timers running concurrently.
- Option D is partly correct in that the coroutine runs indefinitely until stopped, but it doesn't handle multiple start calls or ensure full cancellation of the timer as described in option C.
