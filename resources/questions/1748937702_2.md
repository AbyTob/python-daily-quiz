    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval, callback):
        self.interval = interval
        self.callback = callback
        self.task = None

    async def start(self):
        self.task = asyncio.create_task(self.run())

    async def run(self):
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
            self.callback()

async def on_timer():
    print("Timer tick")

timer = AsyncTimer(1, on_timer)
await timer.start()
```

The code creates an `AsyncTimer` class that runs a coroutine in the background at a specified interval. The `on_timer` function is called every second.

What will happen when you run this code?

A) The program will print "Timer tick" every second.
B) An error will be raised because `start` needs to be awaited.
C) The timer will start but not perform any action.
D) The program will hang indefinitely without printing anything.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is A) The program will print "Timer tick" every second.

Explanation: In the provided code, `AsyncTimer` starts an asynchronous task that runs `run()` method using `asyncio.create_task()`. Inside the `run()` method, there's a loop that sleeps for the specified interval (1 second in this case) and then calls the callback function (`on_timer`). Since we are awaiting `timer.start()` when calling `await timer.start()`, it correctly runs the task in the background. Therefore, "Timer tick" will be printed every second as expected.
