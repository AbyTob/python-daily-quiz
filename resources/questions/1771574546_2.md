    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes both decorators and metaclasses:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds to run.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = timer(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def method1(self, a, b):
        time.sleep(1)
        return a + b

    def method2(self, c):
        time.sleep(0.5)
        return c * 2
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and effects of the code?

A) The `MyClass` metaclass dynamically wraps all its callable methods with the `timer` decorator to measure their execution time.

B) The `timer` decorator is applied only to `method1` and not to `method2`.

C) The use of a metaclass in this context has no effect on the functionality of the class methods.

D) All method calls to `MyClass` instances will raise exceptions due to missing arguments.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `MyClass` metaclass dynamically wraps all its callable methods with the `timer` decorator to measure their execution time.

Explanation:
The correct answer is A. In Python, metaclasses are classes that create and control other classes. Here, the `Meta` class is used as a metaclass for `MyClass`, which means it will be applied to every method defined within `MyClass`. The metaclass's `__new__` method iterates over all attributes of `MyClass` (including methods). If an attribute is callable (i.e., a function or method), the `timer` decorator is dynamically applied to it. This results in each method being wrapped with the `timer` decorator, which measures and prints the execution time of these methods when they are called. Therefore, both `method1` and `method2` will have their execution times measured by the `timer` decorator.
