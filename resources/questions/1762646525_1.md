    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses both decorators and metaclasses:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if '__init__' not in dct:
            raise ValueError(f"{name} must define an __init__ method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Decorator is running before the function")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Decorator is running after the function")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Create an instance of MyClass and call its method
obj = MyClass(10)
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `__new__` method in `Meta` will raise a ValueError if `MyClass` does not define an `__init__` method.

B) When creating an instance of `MyClass`, the output will be "Decorator is running before the function" and "Decorator is running after the function".

C) The `my_decorator` will only execute if `MyClass` defines a method other than `__init__`.

D) The metaclass `Meta` can be used to enforce that all subclasses of `MyClass` must have an `__init__` method.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When creating an instance of `MyClass`, the output will be "Decorator is running before the function" and "Decorator is running after the function".

Explanation: The decorator `my_decorator` wraps the constructor (`__init__`) of `MyClass`. It will execute its print statements both before and after calling the actual `__init__` method. Since the `__new__` method in `Meta` does not raise any exceptions, this code runs without errors, and we can create an instance of `MyClass` successfully.
