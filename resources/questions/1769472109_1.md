    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=Singleton):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to database...")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

Which of the following statements about this code is correct?

A) The `Database` class can have multiple instances.
B) Each time a `Database` instance is created, it prints "Connecting to database...".
C) The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that there is only one instance of `Database`.
D) The `connect` method will be called every time an instance of `Database` is accessed.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that there is only one instance of `Database`.

Explanation: The Singleton metaclass overrides the `__call__` method to control the instantiation process. When an instance of `Database` is created, it checks if an instance already exists in the `_instances` dictionary. If not, it creates a new instance and stores it in the dictionary. Any subsequent attempts to create an instance return the previously stored instance, ensuring that only one instance of `Database` exists throughout the application. Therefore, `db1 is db2` will be `True`, confirming that the Singleton pattern is correctly implemented.
