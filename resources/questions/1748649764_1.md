    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

@Singleton
class ConfigManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.configs = {}

    def set_config(self, key, value):
        self.configs[key] = value

    def get_config(self, key):
        return self.configs.get(key, None)

def thread_task(manager, key, value):
    manager.set_config(key, value)
    print(f"Thread {threading.current_thread().name}: Config set to {manager.get_config(key)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    config_manager = ConfigManager()
    
    threads = []
    for i in range(5):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_task, args=(config_manager, f'key_{i}', f'value_{i}'))
        threads.append(thread)
        thread.start()

    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

    print(f"Final config: {config_manager.get_config('key_0')}")
```

What is the expected output of this code? Explain why.

A) Each thread prints its own key-value pair and finally, 'Final config' will be `{'key_0': 'value_0'}`  
B) All threads print 'None' for the value since they are accessing a shared resource without synchronization. Finally, 'Final config' will be `{'key_0': 'value_4'}`  
C) A `TypeError` is raised because the `Singleton` metaclass cannot handle multiple arguments in its `__call__` method.  
D) Each thread prints its own key-value pair and finally, 'Final config' will be `{'key_0': 'value_4'}`
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Each thread prints its own key-value pair and finally, 'Final config' will be `{'key_0': 'value_0'}`  

Explanation:
- The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of the `ConfigManager` class is created.
- However, since there is no synchronization mechanism in place (e.g., locks), multiple threads can modify the `configs` dictionary simultaneously, leading to race conditions.
- When a thread writes to `self.configs[key]`, it may not see the most up-to-date value written by another thread due to these race conditions. This explains why the output of each thread printing its own key-value pair but the final config having only one entry (`{'key_0': 'value_4'}`) is possible.
- The actual final config will depend on the timing and order in which threads complete their operations, so `{'key_0': 'value_0'}` is a plausible output among others.
