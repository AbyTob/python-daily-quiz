    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add a method dynamically to a class at the time of its creation:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Usage
instance = MyClass()
print(instance.dynamic_method())
```

What will be the output of `print(instance.dynamic_method())` when this code is executed?

A) TypeError: MyClass object has no attribute 'dynamic_method'

B) Hello from MyClass

C) AttributeError: module '__main__' has no attribute 'dynamic_method'

D) NameError: name 'MyClass' is not defined
    
    ## Answer
    B) Hello from MyClass

Explanation:
The metaclass `Meta` dynamically adds a method named `dynamic_method` to the class `MyClass` at the time of its creation. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and `dynamic_method` is called, it executes the lambda function defined in the metaclass, which returns a string indicating the name of the class. Therefore, the output will be "Hello from MyClass".
