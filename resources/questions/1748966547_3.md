    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching data from {url}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate a network delay
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def main():
    tasks = [fetch_data(f"http://example.com/{i}") for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this program when run?

A) Fetching data from http://example.com/0, Fetching data from http://example.com/1, Fetching data from http://example.com/2, Fetching data from http://example.com/3, Fetching data from http://example.com/4
B) Data from http://example.com/0, Data from http://example.com/1, Data from http://example.com/2, Data from http://example.com/3, Data from http://example.com/4
C) Fetching data from http://example.com/0, Data from http://example.com/0, Fetching data from http://example.com/1, Data from http://example.com/1, Fetching data from http://example.com/2, Data from http://example.com/2, Fetching data from http://example.com/3, Data from http://example.com/3, Fetching data from http://example.com/4, Data from http://example.com/4
D) Fetching data from http://example.com/0, Fetching data from http://example.com/1, Fetching data from http://example.com/2, Fetching data from http://example.com/3, Fetching data from http://example.com/4, Data from http://example.com/4

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) Data from http://example.com/0, Data from http://example.com/1, Data from http://example.com/2, Data from http://example.com/3, Data from http://example.com/4

Explanation: The `asyncio.gather` function runs all the coroutines concurrently and waits for all of them to complete. Each coroutine fetches data from a URL in an asynchronous manner. When all coroutines finish, their results are gathered and printed.

Option A is incorrect because it only prints the "Fetching" messages before the sleep completes.
Option C is incorrect because it incorrectly interleaves the fetching and data retrieval steps.
Option D is incorrect because it prints "Fetching" messages first for all URLs and then the data from the last URL.
