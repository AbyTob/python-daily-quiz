    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses both decorators and metaclasses:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Class {name} is being created")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def my_decorator(cls):
    class Wrapper(cls):
        def wrapper_method(self):
            print("Wrapper method called")
    return Wrapper

@my_decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self):
        print("MyClass instance created")

# Create an instance of MyClass
obj = MyClass()
```

Which of the following statements is true about the behavior of this code when executed?

A) The output will be "Class MyClass is being created" and nothing else.

B) The output will be "Wrapper method called" and then "MyClass instance created".

C) The output will be "Class MyClass is being created", followed by "Wrapper method called", and then "MyClass instance created".

D) An error will occur because decorators cannot be used with metaclasses.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The output will be "Class MyClass is being created", followed by "Wrapper method called", and then "MyClass instance created".

Explanation: When a class `MyClass` is defined with both a metaclass (`Meta`) and a decorator (`my_decorator`), Python first creates the class using the metaclass, which prints "Class MyClass is being created". Then, the decorator is applied to the class, wrapping it in another class `Wrapper`, which adds a new method `wrapper_method`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, both the original class and the wrapper are involved. The wrapper's initialization happens first, printing "Wrapper method called", and then the original class's `__init__` method runs, printing "MyClass instance created".
