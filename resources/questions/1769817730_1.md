    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes dynamically:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'foo' not in dct:
            dct['foo'] = lambda self: "This is a dynamically added method."
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Base(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class Derived(Base):
    def bar(self):
        pass
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `Derived` class will raise an error because it does not implement an abstract method.

B) When an instance of `Derived` calls `foo()`, it will return "This is a dynamically added method."

C) The `Meta` metaclass ensures that all classes derived from `Base` have a `foo()` method, but it will not add `foo()` to the `Base` class itself.

D) The `Bar` class, which inherits from `Derived`, will not have access to the `foo()` method.
    
    ## Answer
    B) When an instance of `Derived` calls `foo()`, it will return "This is a dynamically added method."

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` adds a `foo` method to any class that does not already have one. Since `Base` and `Derived` are both derived from `Base`, they will all inherit the `foo` method.
- Therefore, creating an instance of `Derived` and calling its `foo()` method will indeed return "This is a dynamically added method."
- Options A, C, and D are incorrect because:
  - Option A does not apply since there are no abstract methods involved.
  - Option C is wrong because the metaclass adds `foo` to all classes derived from `Base`, including `Derived`.
  - Option D is incorrect because `Derived` instances have access to all methods inherited from their base classes.
