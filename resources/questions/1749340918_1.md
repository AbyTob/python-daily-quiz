    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval
        self.tasks = []

    def register(self, coro):
        task = asyncio.create_task(coro)
        self.tasks.append(task)

    async def run(self):
        while True:
            for task in self.tasks.copy():
                if not task.done():
                    await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
                    task.add_done_callback(lambda _: print("Task completed"))
            await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    timer = AsyncTimer(2)
    async def my_coroutine():
        await asyncio.sleep(5)
        print("Coroutine done")

    timer.register(my_coroutine())
    await timer.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this code snippet?  
A) "Task completed" will be printed after 5 seconds.  
B) The program will hang indefinitely as it is waiting for tasks to complete before exiting.  
C) "Task completed" will never be printed because the loop in `run` exits immediately after starting the coroutine.  
D) "Coroutine done" will be printed after 5 seconds and "Task completed" will be printed after every interval of 2 seconds until the coroutine completes.
    
    ## Answer
    A) "Task completed" will be printed after 5 seconds.  

**Explanation:** The `run` method of `AsyncTimer` continuously checks for tasks that are not done, and if such a task is found, it waits for the interval time (2 seconds in this case) before printing "Task completed". Since the coroutine registered with `register` completes after 5 seconds, when `run` wakes up for the first time, it will print "Task completed" at that point. After that, since the coroutine has already finished, no further "Task completed" messages will be printed even though the loop continues to run.
