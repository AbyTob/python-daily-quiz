    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
    
    async def get(self, key):
        if key in self.cache:
            return self.cache[key]
        else:
            result = await self.fetch_data(key)
            self.cache[key] = result
            return result
    
    async def fetch_data(self, key):
        # Simulate a network request with asyncio.sleep
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # This is a placeholder for actual data fetching
        return f"Data for {key}"

async def main():
    cache = AsyncCache()
    tasks = [cache.get(i) for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

# Run the main function to see the output
asyncio.run(main())
```

This code defines an `AsyncCache` class that caches data fetched asynchronously. When the `get` method is called with a key, it first checks if the data is in the cache. If not, it fetches the data using the `fetch_data` coroutine and stores it in the cache before returning it.

**Question:** What will be the output of this script, assuming that the network request simulates by `asyncio.sleep(1)` takes exactly 1 second per request?

A) `[None, None, None, None, None]`

B) `[Data for 0, Data for 1, Data for 2, Data for 3, Data for 4]`

C) `[Data for 0, Data for 1, Data for 2, Data for 3, 'Data for 4']`

D) `[Data for 0, None, None, None, None]`

[ANSWER]
B) `[Data for 0, Data for 1, Data for 2, Data for 3, Data for 4]`

Explanation: Each `get` call is awaited in the `main` function. Because these are all awaited concurrently using `asyncio.gather`, they should all start executing at the same time and complete after approximately 1 second each due to the simulated network delay. Therefore, all data will be fetched and cached, and the final output will contain the strings representing the data for keys 0 through 4.
