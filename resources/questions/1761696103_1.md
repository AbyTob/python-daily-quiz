    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question): Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to modify class attributes:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'x' in dct:
            dct['y'] = dct['x'] * 2
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    x = 5

print(MyClass.y)  # Output will be displayed after the question part
```

What does `MyClass.y` print when this code is executed? 

A) 2  
B) 5  
C) 10  
D) The code raises an error
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer): C) 10

The correct answer is C) 10.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` defines a custom `__new__` method.
- When `MyClass` is defined, the `Meta.__new__` method is invoked with `cls=Meta`, `name='MyClass'`, and `bases=(object,)`.
- Inside `Meta.__new__`, it checks if 'x' exists in the dictionary `dct`. Since `x = 5` is defined in `MyClass`, the condition is true.
- It then sets `dct['y'] = dct['x'] * 2`, which calculates to `5 * 2 = 10`.
- As a result, when `MyClass.y` is accessed, it returns `10`.
