    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following code snippet that attempts to create a custom context manager using a generator:

```python
def manage_resource():
    print("Resource acquired")
    yield  # Resource is managed here
    print("Resource released")

with manage_resource() as resource:
    print(f"Using resource: {resource}")
```

Which of the following statements correctly explains why this code does not function as intended?

A) The `yield` statement inside the context manager generator must return a value that can be used within the `with` block.

B) When using a generator-based context manager, the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods are automatically generated by Python.

C) The `yield` statement is incorrectly placed and should be removed to allow for proper resource management.

D) The code will successfully print "Resource acquired", "Using resource: None", and "Resource released".
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer: A**

**Explanation:** In the given context manager implementation, the `yield` statement is used without any value being returned. This means that when you try to use the generator with a `with` statement, Python expects the generator to return an object that can be bound to the variable declared in the `as resource` part of the `with` clause. Since the `yield` statement returns `None`, attempting to bind it to a variable results in `resource` being `None`. This leads to the output "Resource acquired", "Using resource: None", and "Resource released". The correct implementation would include an expression that yields a meaningful value, allowing it to be used within the context manager.
