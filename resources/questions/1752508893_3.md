    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to control attribute creation in a class:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'x' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Class must have an 'x' attribute")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    x = 10
```

Which of the following statements about `MyClass` is true?

A) `MyClass` can be instantiated without any issues.
B) Attempting to instantiate `MyClass` will raise a `TypeError`.
C) `MyClass` inherits from the `Meta` class.
D) The `x` attribute in `MyClass` can be modified after instantiation.
    
    ## Answer
    B) Attempting to instantiate `MyClass` will raise a `TypeError`.

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks during the creation of any subclass whether it contains an attribute named 'x'. If not, it raises a `TypeError`. Since `MyClass` explicitly defines `x = 10`, creating an instance of `MyClass` would not trigger the error. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option C is not true because metaclasses inherit from `type`, not the other way around. Option D is incorrect as attributes defined in a class cannot be modified after instantiation in Python (except for mutable data types).
