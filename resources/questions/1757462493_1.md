    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of the class can be created, no matter how many times it is instantiated.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(SingletonMeta, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass
```

Which of the following statements accurately describes a potential issue with the provided code and how it can be resolved?

A) The `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` should check for `**kwargs` as well.
B) The `_instances` dictionary could potentially cause memory leaks if not managed properly.
C) The use of a metaclass for creating a singleton is unnecessary and overly complex.
D) The code correctly implements the singleton pattern without any issues.
    
    ## Answer
    D) The code correctly implements the singleton pattern without any issues.

The provided code snippet accurately demonstrates how to use a metaclass to implement the singleton pattern. It ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` is created, regardless of how many times it is instantiated. There are no issues with the implementation, and using a metaclass for this purpose is appropriate and correct.
