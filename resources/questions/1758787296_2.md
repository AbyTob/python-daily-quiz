    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, timeout):
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()

    async def start(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(self.timeout)
        print(f"Timer finished after {self.timeout} seconds")

async def main():
    timer = AsyncTimer(2)
    task = asyncio.create_task(timer.start())
    await asyncio.gather(task)

# Run the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `AsyncTimer` class is a metaclass.
B) The `start` method is a coroutine and will run asynchronously.
C) The `main` function is a generator that yields tasks.
D) When run, the program will hang indefinitely.

Part 2 (Answer):
B) The `start` method is a coroutine and will run asynchronously.

Explanation:
The `AsyncTimer` class does not use metaclasses, so statement A is false. The `start` method in `AsyncTimer` uses `asyncio.sleep`, which makes it an asynchronous method that runs on the asyncio event loop, making B true. Statement C is incorrect because `main` is a normal function that returns a coroutine object, not a generator. Lastly, statement D is false; the program completes after 2 seconds as expected, printing "Timer finished after 2 seconds" and then exiting.
