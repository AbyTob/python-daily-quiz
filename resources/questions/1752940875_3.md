    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data fetched"

class DataLoader:
    async def load(self):
        data = await fetch_data()
        print(f"Loading {data}")

# Usage
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
task = loop.create_task(DataLoader().load())
loop.run_until_complete(task)
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?  
A) The `fetch_data` function runs in a separate thread.  
B) The `DataLoader.load` method will complete after exactly 1 second.  
C) The event loop must be explicitly started with `asyncio.run()` instead of manually creating it with `get_event_loop()`.  
D) The `async def fetch_data():` line defines a regular function, not an asynchronous one.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `DataLoader.load` method will complete after exactly 1 second.
