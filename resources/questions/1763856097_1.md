# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to a class dynamically. Your task is to understand how this works and predict its behavior.

```python
class MethodAdder(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: f"Method added to {name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=MethodAdder):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.dynamic_method())
```

What will be the output when running this code?

A) `<function MethodAdder.__new__.<locals>.<lambda> at 0x...>`

B) `None`

C) `Method added to MyClass`

D) `TypeError: MyClass() takes no arguments`

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) `Method added to MyClass`

Explanation:

- The metaclass `MethodAdder` dynamically adds a method named `dynamic_method` to any class it's used for.
- In this case, the class `MyClass` is created using `MethodAdder`, so when an instance of `MyClass` (`obj`) is created and its `dynamic_method` is called, it returns the string "Method added to MyClass".

This question tests your understanding of how metaclasses work in Python, specifically how they can be used to modify classes at creation time.
