    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

@AsyncDecorator
async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulating an async operation
    return "Data fetched"

async def main():
    result = await fetch_data()
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the correct way to call `fetch_data` as a coroutine from within another function?

A) Directly calling `fetch_data()` without awaiting it

B) Using `await fetch_data()`

C) Creating an instance of `AsyncDecorator` and calling its `__call__` method with `fetch_data` as the argument

D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    B) Using `await fetch_data()`

Explanation: To call an async function from within another function, you need to use the `await` keyword. The other options either do not handle the asynchronous nature of the function (A and C) or are incorrect ways to apply decorators in Python (D).
