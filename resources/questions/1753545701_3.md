    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following code snippet that attempts to create a class decorator that modifies a class's methods to print "Hello, World!" before their execution:

```python
def greet_decorator(cls):
    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(value) and not name.startswith("__"):
            setattr(cls, name, lambda self: "Hello, World!\n" + value(self))
    return cls

@greet_decorator
class Greeter:
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Goodbye, World!")

g = Greeter()
g.say_hello()
```

What will be the output when `g.say_hello()` is called?

A) Hello, World!  
B) Goodbye, World!  
C) Hello, World!\nGoodbye, World!  
D) An error
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer: C) Hello, World!\nGoodbye, World!**

**Explanation:**  
The `greet_decorator` is intended to prepend "Hello, World!" to the output of any callable method in the class it decorates. However, when the lambda function captures `value`, it does so by reference rather than by value. As a result, all lambda functions point to the same `value`, which is the last method in the class (`say_hello`), because the loop continues until the last method's `value` is captured. When you call `g.say_hello()`, it executes the `say_hello` method, prints "Goodbye, World!", and then the lambda function (which now points to `say_hello`) adds "Hello, World!" to its output. Therefore, the correct output is "Hello, World!\nGoodbye, World!".
