    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Before function call")
        result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After function call")
        return result

@AsyncDecorator
async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate network request
    return "Data fetched"

async def main():
    data = await fetch_data()
    print(data)

# Run the main function to see the output
# asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this code if you uncomment and run `asyncio.run(main())`? Explain your reasoning.

A) Before function call  
Data fetched  
After function call  

B) Data fetched  
Before function call  
After function call  

C) Error: 'fetch_data' is not an awaitable object  

D) None
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is A) Before function call  
Data fetched  
After function call  

Explanation:

- The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator is applied to the `fetch_data` coroutine.
- When `asyncio.run(main())` is called, it starts the event loop and schedules the execution of `main()`.
- Inside `main()`, `await fetch_data()` is encountered. This triggers the `__call__` method of the `AsyncDecorator` class.
- The decorator prints "Before function call" before calling `self.func(*args, **kwargs)`, which is `fetch_data()`.
- The execution of `fetch_data()` is paused, and control returns to the event loop to process other tasks (in this case, there are no other tasks).
- After 1 second, the simulated network request completes, and `fetch_data()` resumes, returning "Data fetched".
- The decorator then prints "After function call" and returns the result.
- Finally, `main()` receives the result of `fetch_data()`, which is printed as "Data fetched".

Therefore, the output will be:

```
Before function call
Data fetched
After function call
```
