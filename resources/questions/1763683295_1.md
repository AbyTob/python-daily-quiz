    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code:

```python
class Singleton:
    _instances = {}
    
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]
    
class MyClass(Singleton):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        
def create_instance(value):
    return MyClass(value)

instance1 = create_instance(10)
instance2 = create_instance(20)

print(instance1 is instance2)  # What will this print?
```

What will the output of `instance1 is instance2` be? Explain your reasoning.

A. `True`
B. `False`
C. An error
D. The program will hang

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A. `True`

Explanation: The Singleton class ensures that only one instance of MyClass can exist, regardless of how many times it is instantiated. In this case, both `instance1` and `instance2` are created using the same constructor with different values, but since the Singleton pattern is applied to MyClass, only one instance is created and reused, resulting in `instance1 is instance2` evaluating to `True`.
