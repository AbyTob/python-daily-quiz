    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with optimizing a Python function that performs a large number of I/O-bound operations. The current implementation uses synchronous I/O, which blocks the event loop during these operations. To improve performance, you decide to rewrite the function to use asynchronous I/O.

Consider the following synchronous function:

```python
import requests

def fetch_data(urls):
    results = []
    for url in urls:
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            results.append(response.text)
    return results
```

You want to convert this function into an asynchronous version that utilizes `asyncio` and `aiohttp` (an asynchronous HTTP client/server library). Below is your initial attempt:

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch(url, session):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        if response.status == 200:
            return await response.text()
    return None

async def fetch_data(urls):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [fetch(url, session) for url in urls]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return list(filter(None, results))
```

However, you notice that the `fetch` function is not utilizing any concurrency within the loop. Explain why this might be the case and provide a corrected version of the `fetch_data` function that maximizes concurrency.

[A] The loop does not allow for concurrent requests because it only creates tasks but does not wait for them to complete before moving on to the next iteration.
[B] The loop allows for concurrent requests, but the use of `asyncio.gather` is unnecessary and could be optimized.
[C] The function correctly uses `asyncio.gather` to maximize concurrency without creating additional issues.
[D] None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
A: The loop does not allow for concurrent requests because it only creates tasks but does not wait for them to complete before moving on to the next iteration.

Explanation:
In the original code, the `tasks` list is created in a synchronous manner using a list comprehension. This means that all HTTP GET requests are initiated at once, but the loop itself blocks until each task completes, thus not maximizing concurrency. To maximize concurrency, you should create tasks as they become available within an asynchronous context and use `asyncio.gather` to run them concurrently. Here is the corrected version of the `fetch_data` function:

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch(url, session):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        if response.status == 200:
            return await response.text()
    return None

async def fetch_data(urls):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = []
        for url in urls:
            task = asyncio.create_task(fetch(url, session))
            tasks.append(task)
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return list(filter(None, results))
```

In this corrected version, each task is created immediately within the loop, and `asyncio.gather` is used to run all tasks concurrently. This approach maximizes concurrency by allowing overlapping I/O-bound operations without blocking the event loop.
