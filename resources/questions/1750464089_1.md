# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
class MyDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Before function call")
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After function call")
        return result

@MyDecorator
def my_function():
    print("Inside the function")

my_function()
```

What will be the output when `my_function()` is called?

A) Inside the function  
B) Before function call  
C) After function call  
D) Error: __call__ method not defined in decorator
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is C) After function call.

Explanation:
When the `@MyDecorator` syntax is used, Python internally calls `MyDecorator(my_function)` to create an instance of `MyDecorator`. This instance is then invoked with `my_function()` as its argument. The `__call__` method of `MyDecorator` is what gets executed when the decorated function is called. It first prints "Before function call", then executes the original function, and finally prints "After function call". Therefore, when `my_function()` is called, it will print:

```
Before function call
Inside the function
After function call
```
