# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
You are developing a web application that requires a feature to manage user sessions. The requirement is that every session should have a timeout after which it is automatically closed by the system. You decide to use Python decorators for this purpose.

Create a decorator `@session_timeout(timeout)` that can be applied to any function representing an endpoint in your application. When the decorated function is called, it should start a countdown timer based on the provided `timeout` value (in seconds). If the function takes more time than the specified timeout to execute, the session should be closed and an error message returned.

Here's an example of how you might use this decorator:

```python
@session_timeout(10)  # This endpoint has a 10-second timeout
def user_dashboard():
    time.sleep(5)
    return "User Dashboard"
```

When `user_dashboard()` is called, it should execute within the first 10 seconds. If it takes longer than that, an error message should be returned.

Which of the following is a correct implementation of the `@session_timeout` decorator?

A) Using threading.Timer to check execution time
B) Using asyncio.sleep to enforce the timeout
C) Modifying function arguments to include a timeout parameter
D) None of the above

Part 2 (Answer):
A) Using threading.Timer to check execution time
Explanation: The correct implementation would involve using `threading.Timer` to start a countdown timer when the decorated function is called. If the function does not complete within the specified timeout, the timer should trigger an action to close the session and return an error message. This approach allows for asynchronous handling of timeouts without blocking other parts of the application.
