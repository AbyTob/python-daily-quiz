    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data fetched"

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data())
    result = await task
    print(result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code when executed?

A) The `await` keyword is used to block the execution until `fetch_data()` completes.

B) `create_task()` schedules a new coroutine for execution and returns a `Task` object representing the computation.

C) `asyncio.sleep(1)` causes an immediate exit from the program.

D) The `main()` function is executed synchronously because it does not contain any asynchronous operations.
