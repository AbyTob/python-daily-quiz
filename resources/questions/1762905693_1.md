    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {self.func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run.")
        return result

@Timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_sum(10**7)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the usage and behavior of this code?

A) The `Timer` class acts as a decorator to measure the execution time of any function it decorates.
B) The `compute_sum` function will not execute due to an error in the decorator implementation.
C) The `Timer` class uses metaclasses to modify its decorated functions at runtime.
D) The `compute_sum` function calculates the sum of numbers from 0 to n-1 and prints the execution time, but it does not return any value.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `Timer` class acts as a decorator to measure the execution time of any function it decorates.
