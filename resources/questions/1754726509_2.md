    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes it decorates:

```python
# Define a metaclass that adds a method to any class it decorates
class AddMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['additional_method'] = lambda self: f"Added by {name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Apply the metaclass to a base class
class Base(metaclass=AddMethodMeta):
    def original_method(self):
        return "This is an original method."

# Create a subclass of Base
class SubClass(Base):
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    obj = SubClass()
    print(obj.original_method())
    print(obj.additional_method())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) When `SubClass` is instantiated, it does not inherit any methods from `Base`.

B) The `additional_method` is added to all subclasses of `Base` that use `AddMethodMeta`.

C) `SubClass` will raise an AttributeError when trying to call `original_method`.

D) The `additional_method` is only available in the class `Base`, not its subclass `SubClass`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The `additional_method` is added to all subclasses of `Base` that use `AddMethodMeta`.

Explanation: The metaclass `AddMethodMeta` dynamically adds an `additional_method` to any class it decorates. Since `Base` uses `AddMethodMeta`, `SubClass`, as a subclass of `Base`, will also have the `additional_method`. This demonstrates how metaclasses can be used to modify or enhance classes at definition time, providing powerful capabilities for code reuse and dynamic behavior.
