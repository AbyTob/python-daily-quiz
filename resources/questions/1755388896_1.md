    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern:

```python
from functools import wraps

def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    
    @wraps(cls)
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    
    return get_instance

@singleton
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self, db_name):
        self.db_name = db_name

# Usage
conn1 = DatabaseConnection("my_database")
conn2 = DatabaseConnection("my_database")

print(conn1 is conn2)  # Output: ?
```

What will be the output of `print(conn1 is conn2)`?

A. False  
B. True  
C. Error  
D. None
    
    ## Answer
    B. True

Explanation:
The `singleton` decorator is used to ensure that only one instance of `DatabaseConnection` can be created, regardless of how many times it is instantiated. When `conn1 = DatabaseConnection("my_database")` and `conn2 = DatabaseConnection("my_database")` are executed, the metaclass checks if an instance of `DatabaseConnection` already exists in its `instances` dictionary. Since it does not, a new instance is created and stored in the dictionary. The next time an instance is requested, the existing instance is returned, resulting in `conn1 is conn2` being `True`.
