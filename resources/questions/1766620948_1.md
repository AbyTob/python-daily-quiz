    ## Question
    [QUESTION] 

Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to implement a custom decorator for asynchronous functions. The decorator is intended to measure and print the execution time of each function it decorates. However, there are some issues with the implementation.

```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps

def async_timer(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        print(f"Execution time of {func.__name__}: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@async_timer
async def async_task():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

# Usage:
loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
try:
    loop.run_until_complete(async_task())
finally:
    loop.close()
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this implementation?

A) The `async_timer` decorator works correctly and will print the execution time of `async_task`.
B) The `async_timer` decorator fails because it does not handle exceptions raised by the decorated function.
C) The `async_timer` decorator works but prints a negative execution time due to incorrect use of `time()`.
D) The `async_timer` decorator requires manual setting of an event loop, which is unnecessary and complicates usage.
    
    ## Answer
    **Correct Answer: B**

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because the `async_timer` decorator does work for measuring execution time but it fails to handle exceptions raised by the decorated function. If `async_task` raises an exception, it will not be caught or handled by the decorator.
  
- Option C is incorrect because `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` returns a non-negative value representing the current time in seconds since some unspecified point in time, so it won't return a negative value unless there's a bug in the code that sets it incorrectly.

- Option D is incorrect because setting up an event loop for running asynchronous tasks is not complicated and is necessary when working with `asyncio`. This step ensures that the async operations can be executed correctly.
