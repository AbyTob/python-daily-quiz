    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to track how many times a function has been called:

```python
def call_counter(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        wrapper.call_count += 1
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    wrapper.call_count = 0
    return wrapper

@call_counter
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
print(greet.call_count)  # Should output 2
```

What does the code snippet above demonstrate?  
A) A decorator that counts how many times a function has been called.  
B) A context manager that tracks function calls.  
C) A metaclass that alters class behavior upon instantiation.  
D) An async function that waits for user input.
    
    ## Answer
    A) A decorator that counts how many times a function has been called.

This question tests the candidate's understanding of decorators and how they can be used to add functionality to existing functions without modifying their code. The `call_counter` decorator increases a `call_count` attribute each time the decorated function is invoked, demonstrating its use in tracking function usage.
