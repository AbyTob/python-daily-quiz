# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Data fetched"

async def process_data(data):
    print(f"Processing {data}...")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"{data} processed"

async def main():
    data = await fetch_data()
    result = await process_data(data)
    print(result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `fetch_data` and `process_data` functions will run sequentially without any overlap.

B) The `fetch_data` function blocks other tasks from running while waiting for data.

C) Both `fetch_data` and `process_data` functions can run concurrently, improving performance.

D) There is no way to make the `fetch_data` and `process_data` functions run concurrently in this example.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
C) Both `fetch_data` and `process_data` functions can run concurrently, improving performance.

Explanation:
The provided code uses Python's `asyncio` library to define asynchronous functions. Asynchronous functions allow for the execution of I/O-bound tasks without blocking other tasks. In this example, both `fetch_data` and `process_data` are waiting on I/O operations (`await asyncio.sleep()`), which makes them ideal candidates for concurrent execution.

When you run this code using `asyncio.run(main())`, it starts running all asynchronous tasks in the event loop until they complete. Since both tasks are awaiting I/O operations, Python can switch between these tasks while waiting, allowing other tasks to run during their wait time.

This behavior is in contrast to synchronous functions where a task must completely finish before another task can begin, potentially leading to inefficient use of resources if there's significant waiting involved.
