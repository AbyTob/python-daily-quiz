    ## Answer
    Part 1: 
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator and a metaclass together. The goal is to create a class that automatically generates methods based on its attributes.

```python
from typing import Any, Callable

def method_decorator(func: Callable) -> Callable:
    def wrapper(self):
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__}")
        return func(self)
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = method_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class DynamicClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            setattr(self, key, value)

# Example usage
dynamic_obj = DynamicClass(name="Alice", age=30)
print(dynamic_obj.name)  # Output: Alice
dynamic_obj.age()       # Output: Executing age
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when `DynamicClass` is instantiated and a method like `age()` is called?

A. The `__init__` method initializes the attributes, but no additional methods are generated or decorated.

B. When `dynamic_obj.age()` is called, it simply prints "Executing age" and then attempts to call a non-existent `age()` method from the class.

C. The metaclass `Meta` intercepts the creation of `DynamicClass`, adding `method_decorator` to any callable attributes during initialization.

D. The decorator `method_decorator` only affects methods that are explicitly decorated in the class body, and calling `dynamic_obj.age()` does not trigger the decorator.

Part 2: 
The correct answer is C. 

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` dynamically intercepts the creation of `DynamicClass`. During its creation, it iterates through the dictionary of attributes (`dct`). If an attribute's value is callable (i.e., a method), it decorates that method using `method_decorator`.
- When an instance of `DynamicClass` is created, the `__init__` method initializes the attributes based on keyword arguments passed at instantiation.
- When `dynamic_obj.age()` is called, due to the decorator added by the metaclass, it first prints "Executing age" and then executes the original `age` method (which was an attribute of `DynamicClass`).

Therefore, option C accurately describes what happens when a method like `age()` is called on an instance of `DynamicClass`.
