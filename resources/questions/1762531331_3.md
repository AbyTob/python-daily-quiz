    ## Answer
    **Question:**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to enforce a specific interface for classes. The goal is to ensure that any class inheriting from `BaseClass` must define certain methods. If not, it should raise a `TypeError`.

```python
class InterfaceMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        required_methods = ['required_method']
        for method in required_methods:
            if method not in dct:
                raise TypeError(f"{name} must implement {method}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(metaclass=InterfaceMeta):
    pass

class ConcreteClass(BaseClass):
    def required_method(self):
        print("Method implemented!")

# Example usage:
# concrete = ConcreteClass()  # This should work
# non_concrete = BaseClass()  # This should raise a TypeError
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes how to extend `BaseClass` properly and handle the case where it's not extended correctly?

A) You can simply create an instance of `ConcreteClass`, and it will work without any issues.
B) Attempting to instantiate `BaseClass` directly should raise a `TypeError`.
C) If you try to instantiate `BaseClass`, Python will automatically implement the missing method for you.
D) The code provided does not handle the case where a subclass fails to implement required methods.

**Answer:**

B) Attempting to instantiate `BaseClass` directly should raise a `TypeError`.

**Explanation:**

- Option A is incorrect because instances of `ConcreteClass` can be created without issues, as it correctly implements the required method.
- Option B is correct. When you try to create an instance of `BaseClass`, which does not implement the required method, Python will raise a `TypeError` during class creation due to the metaclass check in `InterfaceMeta`.
- Option C is incorrect because the metaclass enforces that all subclasses define the required methods; it does not provide automatic implementation.
- Option D is partially correct but less precise. While the code correctly raises an error when subclassing fails, it doesn't provide a mechanism for automatically implementing missing methods as suggested in this option.

This question tests the candidate's understanding of metaclass behavior and how they can enforce interface compliance across subclasses.
