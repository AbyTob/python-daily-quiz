# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator to measure the execution time of a function. The decorator should also ensure that the function is only called once, regardless of how many times it is attempted to be called.

```python
import time

def measure_and_once(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(wrapper, 'called'):
            wrapper.called = True
            start_time = time.time()
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f"Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
            return result
        else:
            raise Exception("Function already called once.")
    return wrapper

@measure_and_once
def compute_heavy_task():
    time.sleep(2)
    return "Task Completed"

# Example usage:
try:
    print(compute_heavy_task())
    print(compute_heavy_task())  # This should raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

Which of the following is a correct statement about this code?

A) The decorator `measure_and_once` will correctly measure and print the execution time of `compute_heavy_task`.
B) The decorator will execute `compute_heavy_task` twice, printing its execution time each time.
C) The second call to `compute_heavy_task` after it has been called once will successfully execute without any exceptions.
D) The code contains a memory leak due to the use of the decorator.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**
A) The decorator `measure_and_once` will correctly measure and print the execution time of `compute_heavy_task`.

Explanation: This answer is correct because the decorator checks if the function has already been called by checking the presence of an attribute (`wrapper.called`). If not, it sets this attribute to `True`, measures the execution time, prints it, and then returns the result. If the function is called again, it raises an exception as expected.
