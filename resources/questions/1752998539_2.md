    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run")
        return result
    return wrapper

class AsyncTimer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Async operation took {end_time - self.start_time:.4f} seconds")

async def async_task():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Async task completed")

# Using the decorator
@timer
def sync_function():
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Sync function completed")

# Using the context manager
with AsyncTimer() as timer:
    asyncio.run(async_task())
```

Given this setup, which of the following statements is true about the performance measurement?

A) The `sync_function` will measure its execution time correctly when called.

B) The `async_task` inside the `AsyncTimer` context manager will not measure the correct execution time because it's asynchronous and not awaited properly.

C) Both `sync_function` and `async_task` are measured accurately due to the use of their respective decorators and context managers.

D) The `timer` decorator cannot be used to measure the execution time of asynchronous functions like `async_task`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Incorrect. While the `sync_function` is decorated with `@timer`, it measures its execution time correctly because it runs synchronously and completes before the timer ends.

B) Correct. The `async_task` inside the `AsyncTimer` context manager will not measure the correct execution time because it's asynchronous and not awaited properly. As a result, the end_time in `__exit__` is taken immediately after starting the timer, leading to an incorrect measurement of 0 seconds.

C) Incorrect. Although both `sync_function` and `async_task` are decorated with their respective timers, the async task inside `AsyncTimer` will not measure its execution time correctly due to the non-awaited nature of the task within the context manager.

D) Incorrect. The `timer` decorator can be used to measure the execution time of asynchronous functions like `async_task`, but it requires proper handling outside a context manager or by awaiting it properly if inside a decorator.
