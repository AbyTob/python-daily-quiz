    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

class Singleton:
    _instance = None
    _lock = threading.Lock()

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls._instance:
            with cls._lock:
                if not cls._instance:
                    cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

def thread_task(singleton_instance):
    print(id(singleton_instance))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    singleton = Singleton()
    threads = []
    for _ in range(10):
        t = threading.Thread(target=thread_task, args=(singleton,))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()

    for t in threads:
        t.join()
```

What is the output of this code when run? Explain why.

A) The same thread ID will be printed 10 times.
B) Different thread IDs will be printed 10 times.
C) The program will raise an exception due to a threading error.
D) The program will hang indefinitely because of a deadlock.
    
    ## Answer
    Answer: A

Explanation: 
The Singleton class is designed to ensure that only one instance of the class can exist. In this implementation, the `__new__` method uses a lock to synchronize access, ensuring thread safety when creating instances. When multiple threads attempt to create an instance simultaneously, only one will succeed due to the lock.

In the main block, a single instance of `Singleton` is created and then passed to 10 threads, each of which calls `thread_task`. Since all threads are passed the same instance of `Singleton`, they will print the same memory address (ID) for this instance. Therefore, the output will be the same thread ID printed 10 times.
