    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, text='Elapsed time:'):
        self.text = text

    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.perf_counter()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end = time.perf_counter()
        print(f'{self.text} {end - self.start:.4f} seconds')

def timed(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with Timer():
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return result
    return wrapper

@timed
def compute_primes(n):
    primes = []
    for possiblePrime in range(2, n + 1):
        isPrime = True
        for num in range(2, int(possiblePrime ** 0.5) + 1):
            if possiblePrime % num == 0:
                isPrime = False
        if isPrime:
            primes.append(possiblePrime)
    return primes

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = compute_primes(100000)
```

Which of the following statements about the code above is correct?

A) The `Timer` class can be used as a context manager without any issues.
B) The `timed` decorator will not work properly due to the `with` statement's context management features.
C) The `compute_primes` function will run infinitely because of the nested loop inside it.
D) The `@timed` decorator will print the time taken by the `compute_primes` function when called.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

D) The `@timed` decorator will print the time taken by the `compute_primes` function when called.

Explanation: The `@timed` decorator is correctly implemented and will wrap the execution of the `compute_primes` function within a context managed instance of the `Timer` class. When the `with` statement in the `__enter__` method is executed, it starts timing. After the `compute_primes` function completes its execution, the `__exit__` method is called, which calculates and prints the elapsed time. Therefore, when you run the code, you will see the output indicating the time taken by the `compute_primes` function to execute.
