# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method `greet` to any class it decorates. The goal is to understand how this works under the hood and what implications it might have on memory management.

```python
class Greeter(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}!"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Greeter):
    pass

# Usage
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.greet())
```

What is the output of this code, and what does it demonstrate about how metaclasses interact with class creation?

A) `Hello from MyClass!` - Demonstrates that metaclasses can dynamically add methods to classes.

B) `AttributeError` - Indicates that adding a method dynamically via a metaclass is not possible in Python.

C) `None` - Shows that metaclasses do not modify existing classes but rather create new ones.

D) Memory error due to excessive memory usage during class creation.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

A) `Hello from MyClass!` - Demonstrates that metaclasses can dynamically add methods to classes.
