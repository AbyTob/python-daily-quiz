    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses:

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = my_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def method1(self):
        print("Executing method1.")

    def method2(self):
        print("Executing method2.")
```

What will be the output if an instance of `MyClass` is created and both its methods are called?

A) 
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Executing method1.
Something is happening after the function is called.
Something is happening before the function is called.
Executing method2.
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

B) 
```
Executing method1.
Something is happening before the function is called.
Something is happening after the function is called.
Executing method2.
Something is happening before the function is called.
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

C) 
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Executing method1.
Executing method2.
Something is happening after the function is called.
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

D) 
```
Executing method1.
Something is happening before the function is called.
Something is happening after the function is called.
Something is happening before the function is called.
Something is happening after the function is called.
Executing method2.
```
    
    ## Answer
    A

**Explanation:** The `Meta` metaclass decorates all callable attributes of any class instantiated with it using the `my_decorator`. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, both `method1` and `method2` are automatically wrapped by `my_decorator`, which adds pre- and post-function call print statements. Thus, when calling these methods on an instance of `MyClass`, the decorator's behavior is triggered before and after each method execution.
