    ## Answer
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass and a decorator:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class MyClass:
    def my_method(self):
        print("Method called")

def deco(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Decorator called")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@deco
def my_function():
    print("Function called")
```

What will be printed when the following code is executed?

```python
obj = MyClass()
my_function()
```

A) Creating class MyClass
   Decorator called
   Method called
   Function called

B) Creating class MyClass
   Method called
   Decorator called
   Function called

C) Creating class MyClass
   Decorator called
   Function called
   Method called

D) Method called
   Function called

Part 2 (Answer):
A) Creating class MyClass
   Decorator called
   Method called
   Function called

Explanation:
The `Meta` metaclass is invoked when the `MyClass` is created. It prints "Creating class MyClass". The `deco` decorator is applied to `my_function`, but since decorators are applied at the time of function definition, it doesn't print anything yet. When `obj = MyClass()` is executed, it creates an instance of `MyClass`. When `my_function()` is called later, it prints "Decorator called" because the decorator has been applied. The method calls ("Method called" and "Function called") happen as expected when the methods are invoked on instances or directly as functions, respectively.
