    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of the class `Singleton` can be created, no matter how many times it is instantiated.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(SingletonMeta, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = None

# Usage
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

s1.value = 42
print(s2.value)  # Output should be 42
```

What does the `Singleton` class do, and what will be printed when `s2.value` is accessed?

A. The `Singleton` class ensures that only one instance of itself can be created. When `s2.value` is accessed, it prints `None`.

B. The `Singleton` class allows multiple instances to be created. When `s2.value` is accessed, it prints `42`.

C. The `Singleton` class ensures that only one instance of itself can be created. When `s2.value` is accessed, it also prints `42`.

D. The code will raise an error because the metaclass `SingletonMeta` does not properly handle instantiation.
    
    ## Answer
    **Correct Answer: C**

Explanation:
The `SingletonMeta` class uses a dictionary `_instances` to store instances of classes that use this metaclass. When an instance is created, it checks if the class already exists in the `_instances` dictionary. If not, it creates one using the superclass's `__call__` method and stores it. Any subsequent calls for the same class will return the stored instance.

In the case of `Singleton`, when `s1` is created, an instance is stored with `SingletonMeta._instances[Singleton] = s1`. When `s2` is created, since `Singleton` already exists in `_instances`, `s2` references the same object as `s1`. Therefore, any changes made to attributes of `s1` are reflected in `s2`. Thus, when `s2.value` is accessed, it prints `42`.
