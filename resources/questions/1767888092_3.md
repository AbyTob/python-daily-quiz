    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add a class method to all classes dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['add_method'] = lambda self, value: setattr(self, 'extra_attr', value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
```

What happens when you run `obj.add_method('test')`?

A) An AttributeError is raised because 'add_method' is not a class method  
B) The method 'add_method' is added to the object 'obj', but it cannot be called on other instances of MyClass  
C) The method 'add_method' is added as a class method to all instances of MyClass, and you can call `MyClass.add_method()`  
D) A TypeError is raised because metaclasses cannot add methods to classes
    
    ## Answer
    A) An AttributeError is raised because 'add_method' is not a class method
