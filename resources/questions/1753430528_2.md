    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a metaclass that ensures all instances of a class have unique identifiers. The metaclass should also provide a method to retrieve the total number of unique instances created.

Here's the initial code structure:

```python
class UniqueInstanceMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        # Ensure each instance has a unique identifier
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = {}
        id_ = hash((args, kwargs))
        if id_ not in cls._instances[cls]:
            cls._instances[cls][id_] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls][id_]

    @classmethod
    def get_instance_count(cls):
        # Return the total number of unique instances created for this class
        if cls in cls._instances:
            return len(cls._instances[cls])
        return 0

class MyClass(metaclass=UniqueInstanceMeta):
    pass

# Testing the metaclass
a = MyClass()
b = MyClass(1, 2)
c = MyClass(1, 2)

print(MyClass.get_instance_count())  # Expected output: 3
```

Which of the following modifications should be made to ensure that the `UniqueInstanceMeta` works correctly with the given class definition?

A) Ensure that `id_` is calculated outside the `if id_ not in cls._instances[cls]:` block  
B) Modify the `__call__` method to use a different approach for generating unique identifiers  
C) Add a check to ensure `args` and `kwargs` are hashable before creating an identifier  
D) Change the `_instances` dictionary to use a list instead of a dictionary
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] C) Add a check to ensure `args` and `kwargs` are hashable before creating an identifier

Explanation: The current implementation assumes that `args` and `kwargs` can be hashed, which is not always the case. If `args` or `kwargs` contain unhashable types (like lists or dictionaries), it will raise a `TypeError`. To fix this, you should add a check to ensure both `args` and `kwargs` are hashable before creating an identifier.
