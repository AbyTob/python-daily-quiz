    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to automatically add a method `add_one` to any class it decorates:

```python
class AddOneMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['add_one'] = lambda self: self.value + 1
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AddOneMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

obj = MyClass(5)
print(obj.add_one())
```

What is the output of `print(obj.add_one())` and why?

A) 6  
B) TypeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'add_one'  
C) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'value'  
D) SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    
    ## Answer
    Answer: A) 6  

Explanation:
The metaclass `AddOneMeta` is used to add a method `add_one` to any class it decorates. In this case, the class `MyClass` is decorated with `AddOneMeta`, and thus gets an `add_one` method added dynamically during its creation. When `obj = MyClass(5)` is executed, `MyClass` becomes an instance of `MyClass` with a value of 5. Calling `print(obj.add_one())` invokes the dynamically added `add_one` method, which returns `self.value + 1`, resulting in 6 being printed to the console. This demonstrates how metaclasses can be used to extend or modify classes at the time they are defined.
