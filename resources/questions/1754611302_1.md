    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to modify a class dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        # Modify attributes here
        attrs['new_attr'] = 'This is new'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    existing_attr = 'Existing'

# Create an instance of MyClass and print its attributes
instance = MyClass()
print(instance.existing_attr)
print(instance.new_attr)
```

What does the following code do?

A) Creates a new class with no attributes  
B) Prints "This is new" twice  
C) Adds a new attribute to `MyClass` and prints its value along with the existing attribute  
D) Raises an error

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct Answer:** C) Adds a new attribute to `MyClass` and prints its value along with the existing attribute

**Explanation:**

In this code, we define a metaclass `Meta` that inherits from `type`. The `__new__` method of this metaclass is overridden to dynamically add a new attribute `new_attr` with the value 'This is new' to any class that uses it as its metaclass. When we create an instance of `MyClass`, which uses `Meta` as its metaclass, the `__new__` method in `Meta` modifies the class by adding `new_attr`. Therefore, when we print the attributes of `instance`, we see both the existing attribute `existing_attr` and the new attribute `new_attr` being printed.
