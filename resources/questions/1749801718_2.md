    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses metaclasses to add a method to all classes dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['new_method'] = lambda self: 'This is a new method'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Base(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class Derived(Base):
    pass

def test_metaclass():
    obj = Derived()
    assert obj.new_method() == 'This is a new method'
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `new_method` will only be added to the `Derived` class, not `Base`.

B) When `Derived` inherits from `Base`, no methods are added because metaclasses cannot modify existing classes.

C) The `new_method` will be available on all instances of any subclass of `Base`, including `Derived`.

D) The `new_method` is only accessible if the class is instantiated directly with `Meta()`, not through inheritance.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
In Python, metaclasses control how a class is created. When a new class is defined, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called with the class name, its base classes, and a dictionary of attributes. The code in the question demonstrates that the metaclass adds a method to all classes derived from it.

In this case, when `Derived` inherits from `Base`, the `Meta.__new__` method is invoked for both `Base` and `Derived`. This means that `new_method` is added not just to `Derived` but also to any class that inherits from `Base`. Therefore, when an instance of `Derived` or any other subclass of `Base` is created, it will have access to the `new_method`.

This example shows how metaclasses can be used to add functionality across all subclasses dynamically, making them a powerful tool for advanced Python development.
