    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to ensure that all instances of a class have a unique identifier, which is generated by incrementing a static counter within the metaclass. However, there's an issue in this code that can lead to unexpected behavior if multiple classes are defined using this metaclass at the same time.

```python
class UniqueIDMeta(type):
    _counter = 0

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        cls._counter += 1
        instance.id = cls._counter
        return instance

class User(metaclass=UniqueIDMeta):
    pass

class Product(metaclass=UniqueIDMeta):
    pass
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) Each class will have its own independent counter, ensuring that `User` instances and `Product` instances will have unique identifiers.

B) The metaclass shares a single `_counter` between all classes using it, meaning both `User` and `Product` instances will share the same set of identifiers.

C) There is no issue with this code as it correctly implements a shared counter for all instances across different classes.

D) The metaclass implementation is correct but may lead to memory leaks due to improper use of class variables.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The metaclass shares a single `_counter` between all classes using it, meaning both `User` and `Product` instances will share the same set of identifiers.

**Explanation:** In Python, metaclass attributes are shared across all subclasses. Therefore, in the provided code, `_counter` is a class attribute of `UniqueIDMeta`, which means any modification to it through an instance of a subclass (like `User`) will affect the value for all instances of other subclasses (`Product`). This leads to all instances of both classes sharing the same counter, thus not ensuring uniqueness in identifiers.
