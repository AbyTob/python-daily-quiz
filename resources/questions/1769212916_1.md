    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following code snippet that uses asyncio and metaclasses to manage a pool of background tasks:

```python
import asyncio

class TaskPoolMeta(type):
    _tasks = []

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        cls_instance = super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        if 'run_task' in dct:
            cls._tasks.append(cls_instance.run_task)
        return cls_instance

    @classmethod
    async def run_all_tasks(cls):
        tasks = [task() for task in cls._tasks]
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

class Task(metaclass=TaskPoolMeta):
    async def run_task(self):
        print("Running a task")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("Task completed")

async def main():
    task1 = Task()
    task2 = Task()

    await Task.run_all_tasks()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `run_task` method will be run immediately when an instance of `Task` is created.

B) All tasks will start running concurrently and complete after 1 second each.

C) When `main()` is called, it will block until all tasks are completed.

D) The `TaskPoolMeta` metaclass ensures that only instances with a `run_task` method are added to the `_tasks` list.
    
    ## Answer
    B) All tasks will start running concurrently and complete after 1 second each.
