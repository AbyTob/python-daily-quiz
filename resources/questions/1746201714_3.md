    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to count the number of times a function is called:

```python
def counter(func):
    func.count = 0
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        func.count += 1
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@counter
def my_function():
    pass

# Now call the function multiple times and print its count
my_function()
print(my_function.count)  # Expected output: 1
my_function()
print(my_function.count)  # Expected output: 2
```

Which of the following statements is true about the `counter` decorator and the `my_function` when it's decorated?

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

B) The `wrapper` function does not have access to the `count` attribute because it is a local variable in the `counter` function.

C) Each call to `my_function` creates a new instance of the `counter` decorator.

D) When `my_function` is decorated, the `func.count` attribute is set to 1 immediately and then incremented by 1 each time the function is called.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `func.count` attribute is correctly incremented each time `my_function` is called.

Explanation:
- A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it. In this case, the `counter` decorator is designed to keep track of how many times the decorated function (`my_function`) has been called.
- The `wrapper` function inside the `counter` decorator has access to all non-local variables, including those defined in enclosing functions. Therefore, it can modify the `count` attribute which was set on the original function object when it was passed to the decorator.
- Each call to `my_function()` increments the `count` by 1, demonstrating that the `func.count` attribute is indeed being updated correctly with each invocation.
