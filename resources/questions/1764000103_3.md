    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Create an instance of MyClass
obj1 = MyClass(10)

# Try to create another instance of MyClass with a different value
obj2 = MyClass(20)

print(obj1 is obj2)  # True or False?
```

What will be the output of `print(obj1 is obj2)`?

A) True  
B) False  
C) Runtime error  
D) Syntax error
    
    ## Answer
    A) True

Explanation: The metaclass `SingletonMeta` ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can exist. When `obj1` and `obj2` are created, the `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` checks if an instance already exists for the class `MyClass`. Since it does not, a new instance is created and stored in `_instances`. The next time an instance of `MyClass` is created (in this case with `obj2`), the existing instance is returned instead. Therefore, `obj1` and `obj2` refer to the same object, and `obj1 is obj2` evaluates to True.
