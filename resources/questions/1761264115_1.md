    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass and a class decorator to achieve some advanced behavior:

```python
import functools

def debug(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = debug(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class MyClass:
    def method1(self):
        print("Executing method1")
    
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("Executing static_method")

# Example usage
obj = MyClass()
obj.method1()
MyClass.static_method()
```

Which of the following statements about this code is correct?

A) The metaclass `Meta` does not modify any methods.

B) The `debug` decorator is applied to both instance methods and static methods through the metaclass.

C) When an instance of `MyClass` calls `method1`, no debug information is printed because it's a method, not a function.

D) Static methods are treated differently by the metaclass and do not have their behavior modified.
    
    ## Answer
    [B] The `debug` decorator is applied to both instance methods and static methods through the metaclass.

Explanation:
The metaclass `Meta` dynamically modifies any callable attribute (methods, functions) within the class it creates. Since `method1` is an instance method and `static_method` is a static method, they are both callable and thus decorated by the `debug` decorator. The decorator logs the call details for both methods when they are invoked on an instance of `MyClass`.
