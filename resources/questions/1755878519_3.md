    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

def measure_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds to run.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.time()
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Timer took {end - self.start:.4f} seconds.")

@measure_time
def my_function():
    time.sleep(1)

with Timer():
    my_function()
```

Which of the following statements is true about the code?

A) The `measure_time` decorator and the `Timer` class both measure the execution time of functions.

B) Only the `measure_time` decorator measures the execution time of functions, while the `Timer` class does not provide any timing functionality.

C) Both the `measure_time` decorator and the `Timer` class can be used interchangeably for timing purposes.

D) The `measure_time` decorator will raise an error when used with `with Timer()` context manager.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `measure_time` decorator and the `Timer` class both measure the execution time of functions.

Explanation: 
- The `measure_time` decorator is a function that wraps another function to measure its execution time. It uses a wrapper function to record the start time before calling the original function, then records the end time after the function returns.
- The `Timer` class implements context management through `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. When used in a `with` statement, it measures the time from when `__enter__` is called to when `__exit__` is called.
- Both mechanisms can be used to measure execution time, though they are implemented differently: one as a decorator and the other as a context manager.
