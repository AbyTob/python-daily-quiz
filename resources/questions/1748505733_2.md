    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code:

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    __metaclass__ = type
    
    @my_decorator
    def my_method(self):
        print("Hello from my_method")

# Create an instance of MyClass and call my_method
obj = MyClass()
obj.my_method()
```

What will be the output when you run this code?

A) Something is happening before the function is called. Hello from my_method  
B) Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method  
C) Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method  
D) An error will occur because `my_decorator` cannot be applied to methods in Python 3

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is C) Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called. Hello from my_method.

Explanation: In Python 3, decorators can indeed be applied to instance methods within a class using metaclasses or by directly applying decorators at method definition. Here's how it works:

- When you apply `@my_decorator` above the method `my_method`, it wraps the method with another function that adds some pre and post-execution behavior.
- The `__metaclass__ = type` in the class declaration is necessary because, starting from Python 3, classes are first-class objects and need a metaclass to be properly instantiated. If you omit this line, Python will raise an error because it cannot instantiate a class without a valid metaclass.

Therefore, when you create an instance `obj` of `MyClass` and call `obj.my_method()`, the output will be as follows:
1. The pre-function call message is printed.
2. The method's code runs, printing "Hello from my_method".
3. The post-function call message is printed.

This demonstrates that decorators can indeed modify class methods in Python 3, even when using metaclasses for class instantiation.
