    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator and a metaclass together. The goal is to create a class that automatically logs when any of its methods are called. However, there's an issue with how the logging is implemented.

```python
import time

def log_method_calls(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} at {time.time()}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class MetaLog(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = log_method_calls(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=MetaLog):
    def method1(self):
        pass

    def method2(self):
        pass
```

What will happen when you create an instance of `MyClass` and call its methods?

A) An error will be raised because the decorator does not handle class methods correctly.

B) The methods will log their calls, but the logging will only occur once for each method definition (i.e., when the metaclass processes the class).

C) Each method call will log the current time, as intended.

D) The methods will log their calls with incorrect timestamps because `time.time()` is called when the decorator function is defined, not each time the method is called.
    
    ## Answer
    C) Each method call will log the current time, as intended.

Explanation: In the provided code, the metaclass `MetaLog` correctly decorates all callable attributes (methods) of the class it creates. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and its methods are called, the decorator `log_method_calls` logs each method call with the current timestamp as expected. The issue in options B and D does not occur because the decorator is applied at the time the class is being defined, not when the instance is created or when the method is called. Option A is incorrect because there's no issue with handling methods in this case.
