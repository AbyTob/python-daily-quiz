    ## Answer
    Part 1 (Question): 

Consider the following code snippet that attempts to create a decorator which measures the execution time of any function it decorates. However, there is a critical issue with this implementation. Identify what the problem is and provide a corrected version of the decorator.

```python
import time

def measure_time(func):
    def wrapper():
        start = time.time()
        func()
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end - start} seconds")
    return wrapper

@measure_time
def my_function():
    for i in range(1000000):
        pass
```

A) The decorator is not correctly capturing the function arguments.
B) The decorator does not handle exceptions that might occur inside the decorated function.
C) The decorator should use `*args` and `**kwargs` to capture all arguments, but it doesn't.
D) There's no problem with this decorator; it works as expected.

Part 2 (Answer): 

C) The decorator should use `*args` and `**kwargs` to capture all arguments, but it doesn't.

Explanation: The original decorator does not accept any arguments (`func`) that the decorated function might take. It only calls `func()` without passing any arguments if they are provided. To fix this, the inner function `wrapper` should be modified to accept and pass along any positional (`*args`) and keyword (`**kwargs`) arguments it receives from the call to `my_function()`. The corrected decorator would look like this:

```python
import time

def measure_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end - start} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@measure_time
def my_function():
    for i in range(1000000):
        pass
```

In this corrected version, `wrapper` now correctly handles any arguments passed to `my_function()`, and it returns the result of calling `func` with those arguments.
