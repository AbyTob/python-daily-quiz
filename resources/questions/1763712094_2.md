    ## Question
    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Data fetched"

class DataFetcher:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url

    async def get_data(self):
        data = await fetch_data()
        print(f"Fetching data from {self.url}: {data}")

# Usage
async def main():
    fetcher = DataFetcher("http://example.com")
    await fetcher.get_data()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is **incorrect**?

A) The `fetch_data` function is an asynchronous function that simulates a network request with a delay.

B) The `DataFetcher` class has an instance method `get_data` which fetches data and prints it.

C) When running the script, it will take 2 seconds to execute because of the `await asyncio.sleep(2)` in `fetch_data`.

D) The `main` function is using the `asyncio.run()` method to run the asynchronous code.

**Part 2: Answer**

A) This statement is **incorrect**. While `fetch_data` uses `await asyncio.sleep(2)` to simulate a delay, it does not actually perform any network fetching or data retrieval. The simulated delay is just for demonstration purposes in an async context.
