    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create an immutable class. The goal is to prevent any attribute from being added, modified, or deleted after the object's creation.

```python
class ImmutableMeta(type):
    def __setattr__(cls, name, value):
        raise AttributeError(f"Cannot set {name} on {cls.__name__}")

    def __delattr__(cls, name):
        raise AttributeError(f"Cannot delete {name} from {cls.__name__}")

class Immutable(metaclass=ImmutableMeta):
    pass

# Usage
a = Immutable()
a.value = 10
```

What will happen when the above code is executed?

A) An `AttributeError` will be raised because `value` cannot be set on the `Immutable` class.

B) The value `10` will be successfully assigned to the attribute `value`, and no error will occur.

C) The code will run without any errors, but `a.value` will not be accessible.

D) An `AttributeError` will be raised because `value` cannot be deleted from the `Immutable` class.
    
    ## Answer
    A) An `AttributeError` will be raised because `value` cannot be set on the `Immutable` class.

Explanation: When an object of the `Immutable` class is created, any attempt to set an attribute (like `a.value = 10`) triggers the `__setattr__` method defined in the metaclass `ImmutableMeta`. This method raises an `AttributeError`, preventing the attribute from being added to the instance.
