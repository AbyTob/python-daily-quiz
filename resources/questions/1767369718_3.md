    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        print("Entering context")
        return self
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb):
        print("Exiting context")

async def main():
    async with AsyncContextManager() as ctx:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("Inside context")

# Run the coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the execution of this code?

A) The `__aexit__` method will be called immediately after entering the context.

B) The `print("Exiting context")` statement will only execute after the `await asyncio.sleep(1)` call completes.

C) The `async with` statement will block the event loop during its execution.

D) None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The `print("Exiting context")` statement will only execute after the `await asyncio.sleep(1)` call completes.

Explanation: In Python, the `async with` statement is used to manage resources asynchronously using an asynchronous context manager. When entering the context, the `__aenter__` method of the context manager is called first, which prints "Entering context". Then, the code inside the `async with` block executes, which in this case includes a sleep operation that suspends execution for 1 second without blocking the event loop. After the sleep completes, control returns to the context manager, and the `__aexit__` method is called, printing "Exiting context". This demonstrates that the `__aexit__` method does not execute immediately but waits until the asynchronous block has finished executing its work.
