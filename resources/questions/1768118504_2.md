    ## Answer
    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to enforce type checking on class attributes:

```python
class Enforcer(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if not isinstance(attr_value, int):
                raise TypeError(f"{attr_name} must be an integer")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyData(metaclass=Enforcer):
    a = 1
    b = "hello"  # This will cause a TypeError

try:
    my_data_instance = MyData()
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```

What will be the output when you run this code?

A) "a must be an integer"  
B) "b must be an integer"  
C) No error, class is created successfully  
D) "Both a and b must be integers"

**Part 2: Answer**

The correct answer is B) "b must be an integer".

Explanation:

- The `Enforcer` metaclass checks that all attributes of any subclass are integers. 
- In the case of `MyData`, both `a` and `b` are defined, but `b` is not an integer.
- When trying to create an instance of `MyData`, a `TypeError` will be raised because the attribute `b` does not satisfy the condition imposed by the metaclass (`Enforcer`). 
- The error message "b must be an integer" is correctly printed.
