**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code snippet that attempts to implement a custom metaclass with a class decorator. The goal is to add a method to any class decorated by this metaclass that logs a message when the class is instantiated.

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_instantiation(cls):
    @wraps(cls)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Instantiating {cls.__name__}")
        return cls(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name in dir(mcs):
            attribute = getattr(mcs, attr_name)
            if callable(attribute) and not attr_name.startswith("__"):
                setattr(mcs, attr_name, log_instantiation(attribute))
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `log_instantiation` decorator does not modify the behavior of any methods defined in `MyClass`.

B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print "Instantiating MyClass".

C) The `Meta` metaclass modifies all callable attributes of its subclasses to log instantiation.

D) Using this metaclass results in a TypeError when trying to create instances of classes decorated with it.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print "Instantiating MyClass".

Explanation:
- The `Meta` metaclass decorates each callable attribute of its subclasses using the `log_instantiation` decorator.
- Since `__init__` is a callable method in `MyClass`, it gets decorated by `log_instantiation`.
- When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `log_instantiation` wrapper function will be called first, printing "Instantiating MyClass" before initializing the actual class instance.
