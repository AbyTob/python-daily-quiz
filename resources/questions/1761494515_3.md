    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that demonstrates a decorator for asynchronous functions. The goal is to measure the execution time of an asynchronous function.

```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps

def async_timer(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@async_timer
async def fetch_data():
    # Simulate an I/O operation like fetching data from a network
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data fetched"

async def main():
    data = await fetch_data()
    print(data)

# Run the async function to see the timing information
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and usage of the `@async_timer` decorator in the provided code?

A) The decorator measures the execution time of synchronous functions but does not work with asynchronous functions.

B) The decorator correctly measures the execution time of an asynchronous function, printing the time taken for its execution.

C) The decorator will cause a runtime error because it tries to get the current event loop outside of an async context.

D) The decorator does not print any output when used on an asynchronous function.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The decorator correctly measures the execution time of an asynchronous function, printing the time taken for its execution.

The `async_timer` decorator is designed to work with asynchronous functions by using the `await` keyword inside the wrapper. When applied to the `fetch_data` function, it accurately measures and prints the time taken for the function's execution, demonstrating proper usage of decorators in the context of asyncio coroutines.
