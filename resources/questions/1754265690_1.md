    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
from contextlib import ContextManager

class MyContext(ContextManager):
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering context")
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print("Exiting context")

@MyContext()
def my_function():
    print("Inside the function")

my_function()
```

What will be printed when `my_function` is called?

A) Entering context  
   Inside the function  
   Exiting context

B) Inside the function  
   Entering context  
   Exiting context

C) Only "Inside the function" will be printed

D) An error will occur
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)
**Correct Answer: A) Entering context  
   Inside the function  
   Exiting context**

**Explanation:**  
The `MyContext` class is a custom context manager. When `my_function` is called, it uses the `@MyContext()` decorator to enter the context before executing its body. This triggers the `__enter__` method of the `MyContext` class, which prints "Entering context". After `my_function` executes, the `__exit__` method is called by the decorator, printing "Exiting context". Therefore, the output will be as described in option A.
