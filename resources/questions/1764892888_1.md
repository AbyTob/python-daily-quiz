    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def slow_task():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Task completed"

async def main():
    result = await asyncio.gather(slow_task(), slow_task())
    print(result)

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(main())
```

What will be the output of this code when run? Explain why.

A) `[None, None]`  
B) `['Task completed', 'Task completed']`  
C) `[('Task completed', 'Task completed')]`  
D) The code will raise an exception

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) `['Task completed', 'Task completed']`

Explanation:
The given code snippet defines an asynchronous function `slow_task` that simulates a slow operation by sleeping for 2 seconds and then returning a string. In the `main` function, `asyncio.gather` is used to run two instances of `slow_task` concurrently. The results of these tasks are awaited in parallel, so both tasks start at the same time and complete after 2 seconds. When the results are printed, you will get `['Task completed', 'Task completed']`, indicating that both tasks have successfully completed.
