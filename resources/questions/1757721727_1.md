    ## Question
    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of the `Singleton` class can be created.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Usage
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # This should print True if the implementation is correct.
```

What additional feature could be added to this `Singleton` class using metaclasses to make it thread-safe?

A. Using `threading.Lock()` inside the `__call__` method  
B. Using decorators on the metaclass methods  
C. Creating a subclass of `SingletonMeta` that adds locking logic  
D. Adding a static method `instance()` to `Singleton`

**Part 2: Answer**

The correct answer is A. Using `threading.Lock()` inside the `__call__` method.

Explanation:
To ensure that the singleton pattern works correctly in a multi-threaded environment, it's crucial to prevent multiple threads from creating separate instances of the class simultaneously. This can be achieved by adding a lock mechanism to control access to the `__call__` method. Here is how you could modify the `SingletonMeta` metaclass to include locking:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock: threading.Lock = threading.Lock()

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
                cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]
```

Now, when multiple threads try to create an instance of `Singleton` simultaneously, the lock will ensure that only one thread can enter the critical section at a time, thus preventing the creation of multiple instances. This makes the singleton pattern thread-safe with this metaclass implementation.
