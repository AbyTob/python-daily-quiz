    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**
Consider the following code snippet that utilizes a decorator for class creation. The goal is to modify the class so that it automatically adds a `created_at` attribute with the current timestamp whenever an instance of the class is created.

```python
import time

def add_created_at(cls):
    class NewClass(cls):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.created_at = time.time()
    return NewClass

@add_created_at
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

# Example usage:
p1 = Product("Laptop", 999.99)
print(p1.created_at)  # This should print the current timestamp when p1 was created
```

Which of the following modifications to the `add_created_at` decorator would ensure that the `created_at` attribute is set correctly and efficiently, even if multiple instances of the decorated class are created in different threads?

A) Ensure that the timestamp is calculated when an instance is initialized.

B) Use a thread-safe method to calculate the timestamp, such as `time.thread_time()` instead of `time.time()`.

C) Introduce a global variable to store timestamps for each instance.

D) Implement memoization within the decorator to avoid redundant calculations of timestamps.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
A) Ensure that the timestamp is calculated when an instance is initialized.

The correct answer is A. The `created_at` attribute should be set when the instance is created, not at any other time. Option B introduces unnecessary complexity and does not address the issue. Option C is incorrect because it violates the principle of encapsulation by using a global variable. Option D is also incorrect as memoization is not applicable in this context since each instance should have its own timestamp.
