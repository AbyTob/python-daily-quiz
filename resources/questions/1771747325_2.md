    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to modify class attributes dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, value in dct.items():
            if isinstance(value, int) and attr_name.startswith('x'):
                dct[attr_name] = value * 2
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    x1 = 5
    x2 = 10
    y1 = 3

print(MyClass.x1)  # Output: ?
print(MyClass.x2)  # Output: ?
print(MyClass.y1)  # Output: ?
```

What will be the output of this code?

A) 5, 10, 3  
B) 10, 20, 3  
C) 5, 10, 6  
D) Error
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct Answer: B) 10, 20, 3**

**Explanation:**
In the provided code, a metaclass `Meta` is defined to dynamically double the value of any integer attribute whose name starts with 'x'. When `MyClass` is created using this metaclass, it applies the metaclass's logic. The attributes `x1` and `x2` are integers starting with 'x', so they are doubled by the metaclass. However, the attribute `y1`, although an integer, does not start with 'x' and thus remains unchanged.

When we print `MyClass.x1`, it should output 10 (5 * 2). Similarly, `MyClass.x2` should output 20 (10 * 2), while `MyClass.y1` remains as 3. Therefore, the correct output is B) 10, 20, 3.
