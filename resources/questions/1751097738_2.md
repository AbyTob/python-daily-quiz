    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator and a metaclass to create a Singleton class. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created, no matter how many times it is instantiated.

```python
# Define a decorator for singleton behavior
def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    return get_instance

# Define a metaclass that combines singleton functionality with other behaviors
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(SingletonMeta, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

# Example usage
@singleton
class SingletonClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

class SingletonMetaclassClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Create instances of the classes
instance1 = SingletonClass(10)
instance2 = SingletonClass(20)

meta_instance1 = SingletonMetaclassClass(30)
meta_instance2 = SingletonMetaclassClass(40)

print(instance1 is instance2)  # Expected: True
print(meta_instance1 is meta_instance2)  # Expected: True
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior of these classes and their instances?

A. Both `SingletonClass` and `SingletonMetaclassClass` create a new instance each time they are instantiated.

B. When an instance of either class is created, the value passed to the constructor is ignored.

C. The `singleton` decorator and `SingletonMeta` metaclass both ensure that only one instance of their respective classes exists.

D. Both classes can have multiple instances, depending on how they are used in different parts of a program.
    
    ## Answer
    **C. The `singleton` decorator and `SingletonMeta` metaclass both ensure that only one instance of their respective classes exists.**

Explanation: 
- The `singleton` decorator uses a dictionary to store instances of the class, ensuring that any subsequent instantiation returns the same instance.
- The `SingletonMeta` metaclass overrides the `__call__` method to achieve similar singleton behavior by storing instances in a class-level dictionary `_instances`.
- Therefore, both implementations prevent the creation of multiple instances of their respective classes.
