**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_method_calls(cls):
    """Decorator to log calls to methods of a class."""
    for name, func in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(func) and not name.startswith("__"):
            setattr(cls, name, _log_call(func))
    return cls

def _log_call(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_method_calls
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b
```

What happens when you create an instance of `Calculator` and call its methods?

A) The decorator does nothing because the class is not being created in a metaclass context.

B) When calling `add(2, 3)`, it prints "Calling add with args: (2, 3), kwargs: {}" followed by "add returned: 5". When calling `multiply(4, 5)`, it does the same and returns 20.

C) There is an error because the decorator cannot be applied to class methods.

D) The decorator causes a syntax error at the point of application.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When calling `add(2, 3)`, it prints "Calling add with args: (2, 3), kwargs: {}" followed by "add returned: 5". When calling `multiply(4, 5)`, it does the same and returns 20.

**Explanation:** The `log_method_calls` decorator is applied to the `Calculator` class. It iterates over all callable attributes (methods) of the class and wraps them with a logging function `_log_call`. This wrapper prints the method call details before and after calling the original method. Thus, when you create an instance of `Calculator` and call its methods, the decorator correctly logs each call and its results.
