    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to track all instances of a class:

```python
class InstanceTracker(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        cls._instances[name] = []
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        cls._instances[instance.__class__.__name__].append(instance)
        return instance

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceTracker):
    pass
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The metaclass `InstanceTracker` does not store any information.
B) The `__call__` method of `InstanceTracker` stores each new instance of `MyClass`.
C) You cannot create a subclass of `MyClass` since it does not allow for inheritance.
D) The `_instances` dictionary is accessible from outside the class.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `__call__` method of `InstanceTracker` stores each new instance of `MyClass`.

Explanation: In the provided code, the metaclass `InstanceTracker` has a dictionary `_instances` that tracks instances created through the `MyClass`. Each time an instance of `MyClass` is created, it gets appended to the corresponding list in `_instances`. This allows for tracking all instances of any class using this metaclass. Therefore, statement B is true.

The other statements are incorrect:
A) The metaclass does store information about the instances.
C) Subclassing `MyClass` is perfectly fine and allowed.
D) The `_instances` dictionary is part of the metaclass and not accessible directly from outside unless exposed as such.
