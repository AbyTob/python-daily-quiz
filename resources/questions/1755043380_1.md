    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a decorator to measure execution time of any function it decorates:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def my_function():
    time.sleep(2)

my_function()
```

Now, imagine you are tasked with optimizing this decorator to be more efficient and maintainable. You decide to use a class-based approach instead of a function-based one.

Which of the following options correctly implements a class-based version of the `timer` decorator that achieves the same functionality?

A) 
```python
class Timer:
    def __call__(self, func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
            return result
        return wrapper

@Timer
def my_function():
    time.sleep(2)

my_function()
```

B) 
```python
class Timer:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {self.func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result

@Timer
def my_function():
    time.sleep(2)

my_function()
```

C) 
```python
class Timer:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {self.func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result

@Timer
def my_function():
    time.sleep(2)

my_function()
```

D) 
```python
class Timer:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def decorator(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {self.func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result

@Timer.decorator
def my_function():
    time.sleep(2)

my_function()
```

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**A) is incorrect.** The `wrapper` function inside the class does not have access to `*args` and `**kwargs`, which are passed to the original function.

**B) is correct.** This implementation correctly captures the function reference in its constructor and uses it during execution, maintaining all necessary parameters.

**C) is incorrect.** There is a missing definition for `*args` and `**kwargs` within the `__call__` method, causing an error when calling the decorated function.

**D) is incorrect.** The decorator application syntax is incorrect; the method should be directly used with parentheses rather than being called as a property.
