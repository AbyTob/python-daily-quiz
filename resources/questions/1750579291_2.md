    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to use a metaclass to add a new method dynamically to an existing class:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        attrs['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: "This is a dynamic method"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.dynamic_method())
```

Which of the following statements about this code are correct?

A) The `dynamic_method` will be added to `MyClass` and can be called on instances of `MyClass`.
B) A TypeError will be raised because metaclasses cannot add new methods after class creation.
C) The `dynamic_method` will not be added to `MyClass`, so calling it on an instance of `MyClass` will result in an AttributeError.
D) The behavior of the code is undefined and could lead to unpredictable results.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `dynamic_method` will be added to `MyClass` and can be called on instances of `MyClass`.

**Explanation:** The metaclass method `__new__` is called when a class is being created. In this case, the `Meta` metaclass adds a new method `dynamic_method` to any class it decorates (`MyClass`). This method can then be accessed and called on instances of `MyClass`.
