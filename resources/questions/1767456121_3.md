    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses decorators to modify a function's behavior:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(1, n+1))

# Call the decorated function
result = compute_sum(1000000)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the `compute_sum` function and its execution?

A) The `compute_sum` function will not run because it's wrapped by a decorator.

B) When called, the `compute_sum` function will print the time taken to execute but return no value.

C) The `compute_sum` function will execute as usual, printing the result of the sum and then the time taken to compute it.

D) The execution of the `compute_sum` function is interrupted by an error because decorators are not compatible with functions returning values.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct Answer: C)**

The `compute_sum` function will execute as usual, printing both the result of the sum and the time taken to compute it. Decorators like `timing_decorator` modify the behavior of the function they decorate by wrapping the original function inside another function (`wrapper`). In this case, the wrapper calculates the execution time before returning the result of the original function. Thus, when `compute_sum(1000000)` is called, it computes the sum as expected and also prints the time taken to do so.
