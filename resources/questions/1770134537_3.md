# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
You are tasked with creating a decorator that measures the execution time of a function and prints it. However, you want this decorator to be aware of whether the function is a coroutine or not. If the function is a coroutine, it should measure its execution time asynchronously.

Create a decorator `measure_time` that meets these requirements. Here's how you might use the decorator:

```python
import asyncio
import time

@measure_time
def sync_function():
    # Simulate some work
    time.sleep(2)
    return "Sync function finished"

@measure_time
async def async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate some async work
    return "Async function finished"
```

When `sync_function()` is called, it should print something like:
```
Sync function finished
Execution time: 2.000 seconds
```

And when `async_function()` is called with `await`, it should print something like:
```
Async function finished
Execution time: 2.000 seconds
```

Which of the following approaches correctly implements the `measure_time` decorator?

A) Using `time.time()` for both sync and async functions.
B) Checking if the callable is a coroutine using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction` and handling accordingly.
C) Simply wrapping the function call in `asyncio.run()` when calling an async function within the decorator.
D) Ignoring coroutines entirely and only measuring time for synchronous functions.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
B) Checking if the callable is a coroutine using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction` and handling accordingly.

Explanation: The correct approach involves checking whether the function being decorated is a coroutine or not. For synchronous functions, we can use `time.time()` to measure execution time. For asynchronous functions, we need to use `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete()` to measure the execution time of the coroutine. This ensures that our decorator works correctly for both sync and async functions without making assumptions about their nature.
