    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior. The metaclass `LoggingMeta` is designed to log when an instance of a class is created.

```python
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        original_init = dct.get('__init__')

        def new_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Instance {self} created")
            if original_init:
                return original_init(self, *args, **kwargs)
        
        dct['__init__'] = new_init
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Usage example:
obj = MyClass(10)  # This will print: Instance <__main__.MyClass object at 0x...> created
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior of `LoggingMeta`?

A) It logs every method call on instances of classes it decorates.

B) It modifies the `__init__` method to add logging when an instance is created.

C) It adds a new class attribute called `log_count` each time an instance is created.

D) It replaces all methods in the decorated class with logging versions.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] B) It modifies the `__init__` method to add logging when an instance is created.
