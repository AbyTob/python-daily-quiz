    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class with a custom behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'x' not in dct:
            dct['x'] = 0
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    y = 1

class SubClass(MyClass):
    pass

# What will be the output of the following code?
print(SubClass.x)
```

A) 0  
B) 1  
C) AttributeError: 'SubClass' object has no attribute 'x'  
D) TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'dct'
    
    ## Answer
    A) 0

The metaclass `Meta` ensures that any class created with it will have an attribute `x` initialized to 0. When `SubClass` is defined, it inherits from `MyClass`, which uses the `Meta` metaclass. Therefore, `SubClass` will also have the attribute `x` set to 0.
