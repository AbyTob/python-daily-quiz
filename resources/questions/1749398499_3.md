    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify a class dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['new_attr'] = 'New Attribute'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    existing_attr = 'Existing Attribute'

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.new_attr)  # Output: New Attribute
```

Which of the following statements is true about the metaclass `Meta` and its effect on `MyClass`?

A) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to instances of `MyClass`.
B) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to the class itself.
C) Instances of `MyClass` do not have access to `new_attr`.
D) The metaclass has no effect on `MyClass`.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The metaclass adds a new attribute `new_attr` to the class itself.

Explanation: In Python, when you define a metaclass, it controls how classes are created. By modifying the dictionary (`dct`) passed to the `__new__` method, the metaclass can dynamically add or modify attributes at the class level. In this case, `Meta` adds `new_attr` directly to the `MyClass` dictionary, making it a class attribute rather than an instance attribute. Therefore, instances of `MyClass` do not have access to `new_attr`.
