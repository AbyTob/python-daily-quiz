    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following code snippet that uses asyncio to create an asynchronous HTTP server:

```python
import asyncio

async def handle_request(reader, writer):
    data = await reader.read(100)
    message = data.decode()
    addr = writer.get_extra_info('peername')

    print(f"Received {message} from {addr}")

    response = f'Hello, {message}'
    writer.write(response.encode())
    await writer.drain()
    writer.close()

async def main():
    server = await asyncio.start_server(handle_request, '127.0.0.1', 8888)
    addr = server.sockets[0].getsockname()
    print(f'Serving on {addr}')

    async with server:
        await server.serve_forever()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `handle_request` function is executed synchronously.

B) The `asyncio.start_server` function creates a synchronous server that handles requests sequentially.

C) The `writer.write` method blocks until the data is fully sent to the client.

D) The `main` function runs in a separate thread.

### Part 2 (Answer)

**
    
    ## Answer
    ** C

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The `handle_request` function is defined as an asynchronous function with the `async def` syntax, which means it will run asynchronously.
  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The `asyncio.start_server` function creates an asynchronous server. It allows handling multiple client connections concurrently without blocking.

- **Option C**: Correct. The `writer.write` method does not block; it schedules data to be sent and returns immediately. The actual sending happens later, which is why we need to call `await writer.drain()` to ensure the data has been fully sent before closing the connection.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. The `main` function runs in the main thread of the asyncio event loop. If you want it to run in a separate thread, you would typically use `threading` or `concurrent.futures`, but that's not related to how this server is set up.

This question tests understanding of how asyncio works for creating non-blocking servers and how methods like `write` and `drain` function in asynchronous programming.
