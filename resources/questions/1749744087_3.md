    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a class decorator for logging method calls. The decorator should log the name of the method being called along with its arguments.

```python
def log_method_calls(cls):
    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(value) and not name.startswith('__'):
            setattr(cls, name, type(name)(lambda self, *args, **kwargs: 
                print(f"Calling {name} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}") or value(self, *args, **kwargs)))
    return cls

@log_method_calls
class Calculator:
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y
    
    def multiply(self, x, y):
        return x * y
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The decorator will successfully log all method calls on instances of `Calculator`.

B) When an instance of `Calculator` is created and methods are called, the original method implementations will not be executed.

C) The decorator does not work because it attempts to replace the method with a new function that logs but fails to preserve the method signature.

D) All methods in the `Calculator` class must be defined using lambda functions for this decorator to work correctly.
