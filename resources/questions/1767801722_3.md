    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a decorator and a metaclass:

```python
# Define a metaclass that automatically adds a 'description' attribute
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['description'] = f"This is a class named {name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Define a decorator to add an additional method to any class
def add_greet(cls):
    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}!")
    cls.greet = greet
    return cls

# Apply the metaclass and decorator to a simple class
@add_greet
class Person(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Create an instance of the decorated class
person = Person()
print(person.description)
person.greet()

```

What will be printed when this code is executed?

A) This is a class named Person  
   Hello from Person!  

B) This is a class named Meta  
   Hello from Person!  

C) AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute 'greet'

D) TypeError: Cannot instantiate abstract class Person with abstract method greet
    
    ## Answer
    [A] This is a class named Person  
Hello from Person!

**Explanation:** When the `Person` class is defined, it is first passed to the metaclass `Meta`, which adds a `description` attribute. Then, it is decorated by the `add_greet` decorator, which adds a `greet` method to the class. Therefore, when an instance of `Person` is created and its attributes are accessed, the output will be "This is a class named Person" followed by "Hello from Person!".
