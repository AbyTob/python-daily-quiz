    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet which uses a metaclass to dynamically add attributes to a class at runtime:

```python
# Define a metaclass that adds an attribute 'dynamic_attr'
class DynamicMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_attr'] = 'I am dynamic!'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Apply the metaclass to a class
class MyClass(metaclass=DynamicMeta):
    pass

# Create an instance of MyClass
my_instance = MyClass()

# Access the dynamically added attribute
print(my_instance.dynamic_attr)
```

What is the output when running this code?

A) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'dynamic_attr'

B) I am dynamic!

C) TypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a class cannot be changed after its creation

D) SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    
    ## Answer
    [B] The output is "I am dynamic!" because the `DynamicMeta` metaclass adds the `dynamic_attr` attribute to any class that uses it as their metaclass. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, this new attribute is accessible through the instance's dictionary.

The code works without errors, and the dynamically added attribute is correctly printed out.
