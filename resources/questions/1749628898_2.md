    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code using async/await for handling asynchronous operations:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching data from {url}")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def main():
    tasks = [fetch_data(f"https://data{i}.com") for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the correct order of operations when running this script? 

A) Fetch data from 0, Fetch data from 1, ..., Fetch data from 4, [Results printed]

B) [Results printed], Fetch data from 0, Fetch data from 1, ..., Fetch data from 4

C) Fetch data from 0, Fetch data from 1, ..., Fetch data from 4, Results are gathered and printed immediately after starting tasks

D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    A) Fetch data from 0, Fetch data from 1, ..., Fetch data from 4, [Results printed]

The correct order is A. The script starts by creating a list of tasks to fetch data from multiple URLs concurrently using `asyncio.gather`. Each task runs asynchronously and prints the message indicating that data is being fetched from its respective URL. After all tasks have completed (due to the `await asyncio.sleep(2)` in each task), the results are gathered and printed. Thus, the messages "Fetching data..." appear first, followed by the printed results of the tasks.
