    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators, metaclasses, and async/await:

```python
import asyncio

def sync_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before calling the function")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After calling the function")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['sync_method'] = sync_decorator(dct.get('sync_method', lambda self: None))
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AsyncClass(metaclass=Meta):
    async def async_method(self):
        print("Inside async method")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("Async method completed")

    def sync_method(self):
        print("Inside sync method")
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `sync_decorator` will not affect any methods in the class because it uses a decorator on an instance method.

B) When an instance of `AsyncClass` calls `async_method`, it will run synchronously and block until completion.

C) When an instance of `AsyncClass` calls `sync_method`, it will add "Before calling the function" and "After calling the function" messages before and after its execution, respectively.

D) The metaclass `Meta` does not modify any methods in the class `AsyncClass`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
C) When an instance of `AsyncClass` calls `sync_method`, it will add "Before calling the function" and "After calling the function" messages before and after its execution, respectively.

Explanation: The `Meta` metaclass modifies any method named `sync_method` to be decorated by `sync_decorator`. Since `async_method` is not a synchronous method, it remains unchanged. Therefore, calling `sync_method` will indeed prepend and append the "Before calling the function" and "After calling the function" messages.
