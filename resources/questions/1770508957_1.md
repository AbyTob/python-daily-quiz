    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval
        self.tasks = []

    def create_task(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        task = asyncio.create_task(func(*args, **kwargs))
        self.tasks.append(task)
        return task

    async def run_all(self):
        while True:
            for task in self.tasks[:]:
                if not task.done():
                    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Small delay to avoid busy-waiting
                else:
                    self.tasks.remove(task)
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)

async def test_function():
    print("Function started")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Function completed")

def main():
    timer = AsyncTimer(5)
    task1 = timer.create_task(test_function)
    task2 = timer.create_task(test_function)
    asyncio.run(timer.run_all())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Question:** What happens if you call `timer.create_task(test_function)` twice before calling `await asyncio.sleep(5)`? Which tasks will be run, and how often?

A) Both tasks will run every 2 seconds after the first one completes.

B) Only the last created task (`task2`) will run every 2 seconds.

C) Both tasks will run every 10 seconds together.

D) The program will raise an error because it tries to add a task after `run_all` has started.

### Part 2 (Answer)
**A)** Both tasks will run every 2 seconds after the first one completes.

**Explanation:** In this scenario, two tasks are created and added to the list of active tasks in the `AsyncTimer`. The `run_all` method continuously checks for completed tasks and removes them. Since both tasks were started before `run_all` has a chance to remove any, they will continue running every 2 seconds as specified by their own `asyncio.sleep(2)` calls.

Option B is incorrect because both tasks are scheduled independently, so neither task will have preference over the other in timing.
Option C is incorrect because the interval for running the tasks is set at 5 seconds during the initialization of the `AsyncTimer`, not 10 seconds.
Option D is incorrect because there is no restriction on adding tasks after `run_all` has started; the program allows adding tasks dynamically.
