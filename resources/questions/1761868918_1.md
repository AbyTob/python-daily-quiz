    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

def thread_safe(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        lock = threading.Lock()
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe
def increment(shared_value):
    shared_value[0] += 1

# Initialize a shared value and threads
shared_value = [0]
threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment, args=(shared_value,)) for _ in range(10)]

# Start all threads
for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

# Wait for all threads to complete
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print(f"Final value: {shared_value[0]}")
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and purpose of the `@thread_safe` decorator?

A) The decorator ensures that `increment` function is executed by only one thread at a time, preventing race conditions.  
B) The decorator makes sure that all threads have access to the global variable `shared_value`.  
C) The decorator prevents memory leaks by ensuring proper garbage collection of temporary variables.  
D) The decorator optimizes the execution speed of the `increment` function.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator ensures that `increment` function is executed by only one thread at a time, preventing race conditions.

Explanation:
The `thread_safe` decorator uses Python's `threading.Lock()` to ensure that only one thread can execute the `increment` function at any given time. This prevents multiple threads from modifying the shared list `shared_value` concurrently, which could lead to data corruption or unexpected results if not synchronized. The lock is acquired before entering the critical section of code where `shared_value[0] += 1` is executed and released immediately after, allowing other waiting threads to enter the section once the current thread has finished.
