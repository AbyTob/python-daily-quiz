    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

def benchmark(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimeIt(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = benchmark(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@TimeIt
class DataProcessor:
    def process_data(self, data):
        result = [x * 2 for x in data]
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a slow operation
        return result

# Usage
dp = DataProcessor()
data = [i for i in range(1000)]
processed_data = dp.process_data(data)
```

What is the purpose of using `TimeIt` as a metaclass here? How does it affect the execution of methods within `DataProcessor`?

A) The metaclass `TimeIt` measures the time taken to execute each method within `DataProcessor`.  
B) The metaclass `TimeIt` makes all methods in `DataProcessor` static.  
C) The metaclass `TimeIt` converts all instance methods into class methods.  
D) The metaclass `TimeIt` logs the method calls without affecting their execution time.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The metaclass `TimeIt` measures the time taken to execute each method within `DataProcessor`.

Explanation: The `TimeIt` metaclass dynamically decorates all callable attributes of a class with the `benchmark` decorator. This means that when an instance of `DataProcessor` calls its methods, the execution time is automatically measured and printed, providing a performance measurement tool directly at the class level without modifying each method individually.
