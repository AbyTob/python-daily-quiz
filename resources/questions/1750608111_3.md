    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def slow_task(delay: int):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    return delay

async def main():
    tasks = [slow_task(i) for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the execution and performance of this code?

A) All tasks will start immediately upon calling `asyncio.gather` and complete concurrently.

B) The first task starts immediately, but subsequent tasks wait for the previous one to finish before starting.

C) The tasks are executed sequentially, waiting for each one to complete before moving on to the next.

D) Each task delay is doubled with respect to the previous task due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

A) All tasks will start immediately upon calling `asyncio.gather` and complete concurrently.

Explanation:
- In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This means that even though asyncio allows for concurrent execution of I/O-bound tasks, CPU-bound tasks are still subject to the GIL.
- When using `asyncio.gather`, all tasks are scheduled concurrently by asyncio's event loop. The tasks start immediately upon being passed to `asyncio.gather`.
- Each task runs in parallel as long as it is waiting for I/O operations (like `await asyncio.sleep(delay)`). Since these tasks involve sleeping, they do not block the event loop, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.
- Therefore, all tasks will start immediately and complete concurrently, with each waiting for its specified delay. This behavior demonstrates how asyncio manages asynchronous tasks effectively without being constrained by the GIL in I/O-bound scenarios.
