    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses both decorators and metaclasses. The goal is to create a class decorator that adds a method `log_method_calls` to any class it decorates, which logs each method call with its arguments.

```python
import types

def log_method_calls(cls):
    for name, attr in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(attr):
            setattr(cls, name, types.MethodType(logged_attr, cls))
    return cls

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        new_class = super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        new_class = log_method_calls(new_class)
        return new_class

@Meta
class MyClass:
    def method1(self, a, b):
        return a + b
    
    def method2(self, x):
        return x * 2

# Create an instance of MyClass and call its methods to see logging in action.
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.method1(3, 4))  # Expected output: Calling method1 with args (3, 4)
print(obj.method2(5))    # Expected output: Calling method2 with args (5,)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the code above?

A) The `log_method_calls` decorator directly modifies the methods of a class to log their calls.

B) The metaclass `Meta` is responsible for applying the `log_method_calls` decorator when a class is created.

C) Both A and B are correct.

D) None of the above.
