    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        super().__init__(name, bases, dct)
        print(f"Class {name} is created")

def my_decorator(cls):
    print(f"Decorator applied to class {cls.__name__}")
    return cls

@my_decorator
class MyClass:
    pass
```

What will be the output of this code when executed? Explain your reasoning.

A) Class MyClass is created  
B) Decorator applied to class MyClass  
C) Both A and B  
D) Neither A nor B
    
    ## Answer
    C) Both A and B

Explanation: The `MyClass` definition is decorated with `@my_decorator`, which prints a message when the decorator is applied. Additionally, because `MyClass` is a subclass of `object` (which implicitly inherits from `type`), it will go through the metaclass's initialization process, printing "Class MyClass is created". The order of operations means both messages are printed as expected.
