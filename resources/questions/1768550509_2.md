# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to dynamically add a method to a class:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.dynamic_method())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `dynamic_method` will raise an error because it's not properly defined.

B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will automatically have a `dynamic_method`.

C) The metaclass only affects classes that are subclasses of `MyClass`.

D) The `dynamic_method` can only be called on instances of `MyClass`, not on the class itself.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will automatically have a `dynamic_method`.

Explanation:
In Python, metaclasses allow you to customize class creation. In this example, the `Meta` metaclass dynamically adds a method named `dynamic_method` to any class that uses it as its metaclass. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, this new method is available on all instances of `MyClass`, allowing them to call `obj.dynamic_method()` and receive the output "Hello from MyClass".
