    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_calls(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

class LoggerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = log_calls(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=LoggerMeta):
    def method1(self, a):
        return a * 2

    def method2(self, b, c):
        return b + c
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) When `MyClass` instances call `method1` or `method2`, no additional output will be printed.
B) The `log_calls` decorator is applied to all methods in `MyClass`.
C) `LoggerMeta` is a metaclass that logs calls to any method it decorates.
D) All methods in `MyClass` will raise a `TypeError` when called.
    
    ## Answer
    [C] LoggerMeta is a metaclass that logs calls to any method it decorates.

Explanation: The correct answer is C. The `LoggerMeta` metaclass uses the `__new__` method to iterate through all attributes of the class being created (`name`, `bases`, `dct`). If an attribute is callable (i.e., a method), it applies the `log_calls` decorator to that method. Therefore, any methods defined in `MyClass` will have their calls logged by `LoggerMeta`.
