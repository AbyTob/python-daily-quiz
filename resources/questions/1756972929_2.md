    Part 1 (Question):  
Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a decorator which tracks the number of times each function is called. However, it does not work as intended due to the way decorators are applied to methods within classes. Your task is to correct the decorator and explain why the original implementation did not work.

```python
class FunctionCallCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.counters = {}

    def count_calls(self, func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            if func not in self.counters:
                self.counters[func] = 0
            self.counters[func] += 1
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        pass

@FunctionCallCounter()
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(2, 3))  # Should print: 5
print(FunctionCallCounter.counters)  # Should print: {<function add at 0x...>: 1}

# Now try to use the method of the class with the decorator
class MyClass:
    @FunctionCallCounter()
    def my_method(self, x):
        return x * 2

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.my_method(4))  # Should print: 8
print(FunctionCallCounter.counters)  # Should correctly track calls to my_method
```

What is the issue with the original implementation of `FunctionCallCounter`, and how can it be corrected to properly track method calls on instances of `MyClass`?

A) The decorator does not handle methods, only standalone functions.  
B) The decorator should use a class variable instead of a dictionary in the instance.  
C) The decorator should be applied using a metaclass or a class decorator to ensure correct behavior with methods.  
D) There is no issue with the implementation; it will work as expected.

Part 2 (Answer):  
A) The decorator does not handle methods, only standalone functions.  
B) While this could theoretically work, it is not necessary for the solution.  
C) Correct. This approach ensures that the decorator correctly tracks method calls on instances of `MyClass` by using a class variable instead of an instance variable and applying the decorator to the class level.
