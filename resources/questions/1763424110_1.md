    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.start_time = None

    def start(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()

    def stop(self):
        elapsed_time = time.time() - self.start_time
        print(f"Elapsed Time: {elapsed_time} seconds")

def timed(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        timer = Timer()
        timer.start()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        timer.stop()
        return result
    return wrapper

@timed
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_sum(1000000)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the `compute_sum` function when executed with `n=1000000`?

A) The decorator `timed` measures and prints the time taken to execute the `compute_sum` function.

B) The class `Timer` is not used anywhere in the code.

C) The `wrapper` function inside `timed` directly modifies the `start_time` attribute of an instance of `Timer`.

D) The `compute_sum` function is executed asynchronously using Python's asyncio library.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The decorator `timed` measures and prints the time taken to execute the `compute_sum` function.

Explanation: The `timed` decorator is applied to the `compute_sum` function. When `compute_sum(1000000)` is called, it starts a timer before executing the function and stops the timer after the function completes, printing the elapsed time. This demonstrates how decorators can be used to add functionality to existing functions without modifying their code.
