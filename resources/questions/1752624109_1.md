    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a Python context manager that logs both the entry and exit of a block, but also measures the time taken for execution. The logger should be able to handle any block of code wrapped within it.

Here's a partial implementation of such a context manager:

```python
import time

class TimedContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        # BEGIN SOLUTION
        return "Entry logged"
        # END SOLUTION
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Exit logged. Total time: {end_time - self.start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return False  # Propagate exceptions

# Example usage:
with TimedContextManager() as entry_message:
    print(entry_message)
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some work
```

What should go in the `__enter__` method to ensure that both the entry and exit logging are handled correctly?

A) `return "Entry logged"`<br>
B) `print("Entry logged")`<br>
C) `raise Exception("Entry logged")`<br>
D) `yield "Entry logged"`
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] B)<br>

**Explanation**: The correct answer is `print("Entry logged")`. This ensures that when the context manager's block of code enters, it logs a message to indicate entry. However, the example usage expects the result of `__enter__` to be returned as the value of the variable used in the `with` statement. Therefore, simply logging "Entry" is insufficient; we need to print it, but not return it from `__enter__`. Options A, C, and D either fail to log correctly or handle exceptions incorrectly, making them incorrect choices.
