    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a metaclass which logs the instantiation of any class it decorates:

```python
class LogMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Instantiating {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=LogMeta):
    pass

a = MyClass()
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `MyClass` will not be instantiated because `LogMeta` prevents instantiation.
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will log "Instantiating MyClass".
C) There will be a runtime error because `LogMeta` does not properly define the `__call__` method.
D) The `LogMeta` class must explicitly call `super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)` to allow instantiation.
    
    ## Answer
    B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will log "Instantiating MyClass".

Explanation:
The `LogMeta` metaclass correctly overrides the `__new__` method to print a message whenever a class is instantiated. The metaclass's job is to customize class creation, and in this case, it logs a message before calling the superclass's `__new__` method to actually create the class. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `LogMeta` metaclass will be invoked, resulting in the log message "Instantiating MyClass" being printed.
