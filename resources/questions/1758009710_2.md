**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add an additional method `log_access` to all classes defined with this metaclass:

```python
class AccessLoggerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        original_init = dct.get("__init__")
        if original_init:
            def new_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
                print(f"Accessing {name} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
                return original_init(self, *args, **kwargs)
            dct["__init__"] = new_init
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AccessLoggerMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Example usage:
obj = MyClass(10)
```

What is the purpose of this metaclass and how does it modify classes that use it?

A) To add a method that logs access to class instances when they are initialized.

B) To override the `__init__` method of all classes, making them immutable.

C) To ensure that all instances of a class are created in a specific memory location.

D) To define a default behavior for methods that do not exist in a class.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) To add a method that logs access to class instances when they are initialized.

Explanation:
The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` modifies the class it decorates by inserting a new method `new_init` into the dictionary of the class. This new method, `new_init`, prints a log message whenever an instance of the class is created, before calling the original `__init__` method to initialize the object. This effectively logs access to instances of classes defined with this metaclass each time they are initialized.
