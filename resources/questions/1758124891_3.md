    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code using a metaclass:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'greet' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("All classes must implement greet method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Greeter(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class Friendly(Greeter):
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello!"

try:
    class Polite(Greeter):
        def greet(self):
            return "Hi!"
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```

What will be the output of running this code?

A) `TypeError: All classes must implement greet method`
B) `None`
C) `Hello!`
D) `Hi!`

[ANSWER]
A) `TypeError: All classes must implement greet method`

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks if each class it creates has a `greet` method. If not, it raises a `TypeError`. In this case, the class `Greeter` does not define a `greet` method, so when we try to create an instance of `Polite`, which inherits from `Greeter` and defines a `greet` method, Python raises a `TypeError` because `Polite` is created before its parent `Greeter` implements the required `greet` method.
