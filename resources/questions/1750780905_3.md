    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure that any class inheriting from `BaseClass` has a specific method signature:

```python
class MethodSignatureMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'my_method' not in dct or not callable(dct['my_method']):
            raise TypeError("Classes derived from BaseClass must have a callable my_method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(metaclass=MethodSignatureMeta):
    pass

class MySubClass(BaseClass):
    def my_method(self, arg1, arg2):
        print(f"Arguments received: {arg1}, {arg2}")
```

Which of the following code snippets will successfully create a class that adheres to the requirements set by `BaseClass`?

A) 
```python
class AnotherSubClass(BaseClass):
    def my_method(self, arg1, arg2):
        print(f"Arguments received: {arg1}, {arg2}")
```

B) 
```python
class YetAnotherSubClass(BaseClass):
    def my_method(self, arg1):
        print(f"Argument received: {arg1}")
```

C) 
```python
class InvalidSubClass(BaseClass):
    pass
```

D) 
```python
class ValidSubClass(BaseClass):
    def my_method(self, arg1, arg2):
        return "Method signature is correct"
```
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] A

Explanation: The `AnotherSubClass` correctly defines a method named `my_method` that takes two arguments as specified by the metaclass requirement. Therefore, it adheres to the requirements set by `BaseClass`.
