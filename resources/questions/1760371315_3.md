    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a metaclass to automatically add a `log` method to any class that inherits from it. The goal is to observe how this metaclass affects the behavior of subclasses.

```python
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Automatically add a log method to each subclass
        dct['log'] = lambda self, message: print(f"{name}: {message}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Base(metaclass=LoggingMeta):
    pass

class Derived(Base):
    def do_something(self):
        self.log("Doing something")

# Usage
obj = Derived()
obj.do_something()  # Output: Derived: Doing something
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when `Derived` is instantiated and `do_something` is called?

A) The `log` method will be dynamically added to each instance of `Derived`.
B) Each subclass of `Base` must explicitly define its own `log` method.
C) When `do_something` is called, "Doing something" is printed directly without any additional text.
D) The `log` method is added to the class `Derived` and not to each instance.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
A) The `log` method will be dynamically added to each instance of `Derived`.

Explanation:
The metaclass `LoggingMeta` automatically adds a `log` method to any class that inherits from it during class creation. Since this happens at the time the class is defined, every instance of `Derived`, as well as any other subclass of `Base`, will have access to the `log` method through the class itself. The `do_something` method correctly uses `self.log("Doing something")`, which accesses the `log` method from the class and prints "Derived: Doing something".
