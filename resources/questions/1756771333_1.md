# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1: Question**
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator along with a metaclass:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'my_method' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Classes derived from MyClass must implement my_method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    @abstractmethod
    def my_method(self):
        pass

def my_decorator(cls):
    class Wrapper(cls):
        def __init_subclass__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init_subclass__(**kwargs)
            print("Decorator is active")
    return Wrapper

@my_decorator
class DerivedClass(MyClass):
    def my_method(self):
        print("Derived method called")

d = DerivedClass()
d.my_method()
```

Which of the following statements accurately describes what happens when the code is executed?

A) The metaclass ensures that `DerivedClass` implements `my_method`, and the decorator prints "Decorator is active" before creating any instance of `DerivedClass`.

B) The metaclass raises a `TypeError` because `DerivedClass` does not implement `my_method`, and the decorator does not execute.

C) The decorator raises an error when trying to create an instance of `DerivedClass`.

D) The metaclass checks for `my_method`, but the decorator does not interfere with the class creation or method execution.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2: Answer**
A) The metaclass ensures that `DerivedClass` implements `my_method`, and the decorator prints "Decorator is active" before creating any instance of `DerivedClass`.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` checks if `my_method` is implemented in any class derived from it. Since `DerivedClass` implements `my_method`, no error is raised.
- The decorator `my_decorator` wraps the original class with a new class `Wrapper`. When `DerivedClass` is created, its `__init_subclass__` method is called by Python's type system, which in turn calls the `__init_subclass__` of the `Wrapper` class. This results in printing "Decorator is active" before the instance of `DerivedClass` is actually created.
- Therefore, when `d = DerivedClass()` is executed, it correctly prints "Decorator is active" and then proceeds to create an instance of `DerivedClass`.
