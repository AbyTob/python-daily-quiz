    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern. A singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection = "Database Connection Established"

def use_database():
    db1 = Database()
    db2 = Database()
    print(db1 is db2)

use_database()
```

What will be the output of the `use_database` function when it is called?

A) Both `db1` and `db2` are new instances, so their identities are different.
B) Both `db1` and `db2` refer to the same instance, so their identities are the same.
C) An error will be raised because metaclasses cannot be used with singletons.
D) The output is unpredictable due to issues with garbage collection.
    
    ## Answer
    B) Both `db1` and `db2` refer to the same instance, so their identities are the same.

Explanation:
The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of the `Database` class is created. When `use_database` is called, it attempts to create two instances (`db1` and `db2`). However, because of the singleton pattern enforced by the metaclass, both variables end up referencing the same instance, as stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`, indicating that they are indeed the same object.
