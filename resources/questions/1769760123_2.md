# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator and a metaclass together:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(ABC, metaclass=Meta):
    @abstractmethod
    async def my_method(self):
        pass

@MyClass.register
class ConcreteClass:
    async def my_method(self):
        print("Method implementation")

# Usage
async def main():
    obj = ConcreteClass()
    await obj.my_method()

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `Meta` metaclass will not be called when creating `ConcreteClass`.
B) The `my_method` method in `ConcreteClass` will be registered as an abstract method.
C) When running the program, it will print "Creating class ConcreteClass" and then raise a TypeError.
D) The `ConcreteClass` can successfully register itself as a subclass of `MyClass`.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
The correct answer is D.

Explanation:
- A metaclass is invoked when a class is being created, and it can customize the creation process. In this case, the `Meta` metaclass will be called because `ConcreteClass` is a subclass of `MyClass`, which specifies `metaclass=Meta`.
- The `register` method of an ABC (Abstract Base Class) allows a concrete class to register itself as an implementation of the abstract methods defined in the ABC. This registration does not affect whether the method is considered abstract or not; it simply adds the class to the set of known subclasses that implement all abstract methods.
- Therefore, when running the program, "Creating class ConcreteClass" will be printed by the metaclass, and no errors will occur related to `my_method`. The `ConcreteClass` successfully registers itself as a subclass of `MyClass`, making option D correct.
