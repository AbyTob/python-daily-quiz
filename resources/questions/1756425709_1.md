    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching data from {url}")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def main():
    urls = ['http://example.com', 'http://example.org', 'http://example.net']
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    asyncio.run(main())
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total time taken: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `fetch_data` function will run sequentially for each URL, taking a total of 6 seconds to complete.

B) The `main` function creates a list of tasks but does not actually start them until they are passed to `asyncio.gather`.

C) Using `asyncio.gather` allows the fetching of data from multiple URLs concurrently, reducing the total time taken compared to sequential execution.

D) Each URL fetch operation is executed in a separate thread, allowing for concurrent execution.
    
    ## Answer
    C) Using `asyncio.gather` allows the fetching of data from multiple URLs concurrently, reducing the total time taken compared to sequential execution.

Explanation: The `asyncio.gather` function schedules all tasks concurrently and waits for them to complete. This means that while one task is waiting on a `sleep(2)` call, another can continue executing. As a result, the total time taken is significantly reduced compared to running each URL fetch operation sequentially, which would take 6 seconds (2 seconds per URL).
