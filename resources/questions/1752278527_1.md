    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to ensure a class has a method `validate_data`:

```python
class ValidateMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'validate_data' not in dct:
            raise TypeError(f"Class {name} must implement validate_data method.")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class DataModel(metaclass=ValidateMeta):
    pass

class User(DataModel):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def validate_data(self):
        if not isinstance(self.name, str):
            raise ValueError("Name must be a string")
        if not (18 <= self.age < 100):
            raise ValueError("Age must be between 18 and 99")

# Example usage
try:
    user = User(123, "John")  # This should raise an error
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```

What happens when you try to create an instance of the `User` class with invalid data?

A) The metaclass will raise a `TypeError`, preventing the creation of the instance.
B) The `validate_data` method will be called, but no errors will be raised.
C) The metaclass will raise a `ValueError` during the instance creation process.
D) The instance will be created successfully with invalid data.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The metaclass will raise a `TypeError`, preventing the creation of the instance.

Explanation:
When you attempt to create an instance of the `User` class with invalid data, the metaclass `ValidateMeta` checks if the subclass implements the `validate_data` method during the class creation. Since the `User` class does implement this method and the validation logic correctly raises a `ValueError`, the metaclass does not raise any errors. However, when an instance of `User` is created with invalid data (non-string name or age outside the valid range), the `validate_data` method will indeed raise a `ValueError`. But since this error occurs at runtime during the initialization of the instance, the `TypeError` from the metaclass is raised before reaching the `validate_data` call. Therefore, option A correctly describes the behavior in this scenario.
