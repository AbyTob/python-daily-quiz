    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following code snippet using Python's asyncio library:

```python
import asyncio

async def task(name):
    print(f"Task {name} started")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print(f"Task {name} completed")

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(task('A'))
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(task('B'))

    value = await task1
    print(value)

# Uncomment the line below to run the code
# asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this asyncio code?  
A) The `main` function will complete before tasks A and B finish.  
B) The `task` functions do not return any value, so calling `await task1` will raise an error.  
C) Tasks A and B run concurrently, and the output order might be "Task A started", "Task B started", "Task A completed", "Task B completed".  
D) There is a memory leak due to unclosed tasks.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `task` functions do not return any value, so calling `await task1` will raise an error.
