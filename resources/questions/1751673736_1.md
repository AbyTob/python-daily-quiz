    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data fetched"

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        return f"Processed: {result}"

@AsyncDecorator
async def process_data():
    data = await fetch_data()
    return data

async def main():
    processed_data = await process_data()
    print(processed_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this script when executed?

A) `Processed: Data fetched`
B) `Data fetched`
C) The program will hang indefinitely
D) An error will be thrown
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is A) `Processed: Data fetched`.

Explanation:

1. **Async Function `fetch_data`:**
   - This function simulates an asynchronous operation using `asyncio.sleep(1)` which suspends the execution for 1 second and then returns a string "Data fetched".

2. **Class `AsyncDecorator`:**
   - This class is designed to be used as a decorator to modify the behavior of async functions.
   - The `__init__` method takes an async function (`func`) as an argument and stores it.
   - The `__call__` method is defined to accept any number of positional arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).
   - Inside the `__call__` method, the async function is awaited, and then a string "Processed: " is prepended to the result.

3. **Decorator Application:**
   - The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator is applied to the `process_data` coroutine.
   - When `process_data` is called inside the `main` coroutine, it passes through the `AsyncDecorator`, which awaits the original `fetch_data` function and prepends "Processed: " to its result.

4. **Execution of `main`:**
   - The `asyncio.run(main())` statement runs the `main` coroutine, which in turn calls `process_data`.
   - Since `process_data` is decorated with `AsyncDecorator`, it first processes the data by prepending "Processed: " and then prints the result.

Therefore, the output of the script will be:
```
Processed: Data fetched
```
