    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to measure the execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

async def async_compute_sum(n):
    return await compute_sum(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(compute_sum(1000000))  # Synchronous call
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(async_compute_sum(1000000))  # Asynchronous call
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `time_decorator` will not measure the execution time of asynchronous functions.
B) The `async_compute_sum` function will block the event loop when called synchronously.
C) Both synchronous and asynchronous calls to `compute_sum` will be measured correctly by the `time_decorator`.
D) The `time_decorator` can be applied directly to asynchronous functions without any issues.

### Part 2 (Answer)
**
    
    ## Answer
    ** C  
**Explanation:** The `time_decorator` is a synchronous decorator that measures the execution time of functions it decorates. It works correctly with both synchronous and asynchronous calls, as shown in the example. In the case of `compute_sum`, the decorator will measure its execution time whether called synchronously or asynchronously through an event loop. However, for true async functions, a different approach (like using asyncio's `time.perf_counter()`) would be more appropriate to avoid blocking the event loop during the measurement.
