    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to modify class attributes dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for key, value in dct.items():
            if isinstance(value, int):
                dct[key] = value * 2
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    x = 10
    y = "hello"
    z = 5
```

What will be the output of the following code when it is executed?

```python
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.x, obj.y, obj.z)
```

A) 10 hello 5  
B) 20 hello 10  
C) 20 hello 5  
D) TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
    
    ## Answer
    C) 20 hello 5

The metaclass `Meta` doubles the value of integer attributes when a class is created. The attribute `x` and `z` are integers, so their values are doubled to 20 and 10 respectively. The string attribute `y` remains unchanged as it is not an integer.
