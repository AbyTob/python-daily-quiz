Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses both decorators and metaclasses:

```python
import time

def timed(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end - start} seconds to run.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr in dct.items():
            if callable(attr):
                dct[attr_name] = timed(attr)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Timer(metaclass=TimerMeta):
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)
    
    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(0.75)

# Usage
t = Timer()
t.method1()
t.method2()
```

Which of the following statements accurately describes the behavior of this code?

A) Both `method1` and `method2` will print their execution times immediately after they complete.

B) The metaclass `TimerMeta` applies the decorator `timed` to all callable attributes, so both methods will output their execution times when called.

C) Neither method will print any execution time since the decorator only affects instance methods.

D) `method1` and `method2` will not execute at all because they are being replaced by decorators.

Part 2 (Answer):
B) The metaclass `TimerMeta` applies the decorator `timed` to all callable attributes, so both methods will output their execution times when called.

Explanation:
In Python, metaclasses allow for the customization of class creation. In this example, the `TimerMeta` metaclass is used to automatically decorate any callable attribute (methods in this case) with the `timed` decorator when a new instance of the `Timer` class is created. This means that calling either `method1()` or `method2()` on an instance of `Timer` will first execute the `timed` wrapper, which measures and prints the execution time before returning the original method's result. Thus, both methods will output their execution times immediately after they complete.
