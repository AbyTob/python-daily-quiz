    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code using asyncio:

```python
import asyncio

async def task(name):
    for i in range(5):
        print(f'{name} is running {i}')
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(task('Task 1'))
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(task('Task 2'))

    value = await task1
    print(value)

asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this program? 

A) Task 1 is running 0\nTask 2 is running 0\nTask 1 is running 1\n...\nTask 2 is running 4

B) Task 1 is running 0\nTask 1 is running 1\nTask 1 is running 2\n...\nTask 1 is running 4

C) Task 2 is running 0\nTask 2 is running 1\nTask 2 is running 2\n...\nTask 2 is running 4

D) The program will raise an error because task1 and task2 cannot have return values
    
    ## Answer
    A) Task 1 is running 0\nTask 2 is running 0\nTask 1 is running 1\n...\nTask 2 is running 4

**Explanation**: In this code, `task` functions are defined as asynchronous tasks that run concurrently. The `main` function creates two tasks (`task1` and `task2`) and runs them using `asyncio.create_task()`. However, the `await task1` statement in `main()` will raise an error because `task` does not return a value; it only prints messages. Therefore, option D is correct. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they assume that `task` functions have some mechanism to return values or are running synchronously rather than concurrently.
