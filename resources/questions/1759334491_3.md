    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to measure the execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_sum(10**6)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `timer` decorator modifies the original function's behavior by adding a timing feature without altering its core functionality.

B) When `compute_sum(10**6)` is called, it will print out the time taken to execute but will not return any value.

C) The `wrapper` function inside `timer` modifies the global namespace of the decorated function by directly changing its attributes.

D) Using decorators for performance monitoring can affect the readability and maintainability of large codebases.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `timer` decorator modifies the original function's behavior by adding a timing feature without altering its core functionality.
