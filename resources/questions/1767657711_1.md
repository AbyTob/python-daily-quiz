    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval
    
    async def run(self):
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
            print(f"Timer triggered at {self.interval} seconds")

async def main():
    timer1 = AsyncTimer(2)
    timer2 = AsyncTimer(3)

    task1 = asyncio.create_task(timer1.run())
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(timer2.run())

    await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the given code?

A) Both timers will run simultaneously without any interference.

B) Timer1 will always trigger before Timer2 because it is created first.

C) There will be a race condition between Timer1 and Timer2 as they try to access shared resources.

D) The program will hang indefinitely because the tasks are not properly awaited.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Both timers will run simultaneously without any interference.

Explanation: In the given code, `asyncio.create_task` is used to schedule the coroutines for execution. This does not block the main thread, and both coroutines run concurrently. The output will show "Timer triggered at 2 seconds" followed by "Timer triggered at 3 seconds" repeatedly, indicating that they are running simultaneously without interference.
