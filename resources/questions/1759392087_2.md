    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that aims to create a decorator which measures the execution time of any function it decorates:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

compute_sum(1000000)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the above code?

A) The decorator will not work as expected due to the use of `*args` and `**kwargs`.

B) The `timing_decorator` will correctly measure and print the time taken by the `compute_sum` function.

C) The `wrapper` function does not need to return `result` because it is not used anywhere in the code.

D) The decorator will cause a memory leak because of the use of `time.time()`.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `timing_decorator` will correctly measure and print the time taken by the `compute_sum` function.
