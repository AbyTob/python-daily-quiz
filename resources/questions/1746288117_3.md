    ## Answer
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    """This function prints 'Hello'."""
    print("Hello")

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0

    @property
    @my_decorator
    def my_property(self):
        """A property that uses the decorator."""
        return self.value

# Usage
say_hello()
obj = MyClass()
obj.my_property = 5
print(obj.my_property)
```

Which of the following statements is true about the execution and output of the code snippet?

A) The `my_decorator` will only execute before the `say_hello()` function, not when accessing the `my_property`.

B) When accessing `obj.my_property`, the decorator prints "Something is happening before the function is called." but does not print "Something is happening after the function is called."

C) Both statements A and B are correct.

D) None of the above.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) The `my_decorator` will only execute before the `say_hello()` function, not when accessing the `my_property`.

Explanation:
In Python, decorators can be applied to methods in classes. However, when a property is accessed, it does not pass through the decorator because properties have their own getter, setter, and deleter methods associated with them. In this case, the `@property` decorator applies the `my_decorator` only to the getter method of `my_property`. Therefore, the message "Something is happening before the function is called." will be printed when accessing `obj.my_property`, but "Something is happening after the function is called." will not be printed because the decorator does not apply to the setter or deleter methods.
