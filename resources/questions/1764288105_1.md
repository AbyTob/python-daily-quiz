    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data"

async def process_data():
    data = await fetch_data()
    print(f"Processing {data}")

# Main function to run the async tasks
async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(process_data())
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # This sleep is necessary for the task to complete
    print("Main function done")

# Running the event loop
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Question:**
What will be the output of this code when run? Explain why.

A) Processing Data  
   Main function done  

B) Main function done  
   Processing Data  

C) Error: Task is not awaited properly  

D) Processing Data  
   Processing Data
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct Answer:** A) Processing Data  
   Main function done  

**Explanation:**
The code runs two asynchronous tasks concurrently. The `main` function creates a task for `process_data` and then immediately proceeds to sleep for 2 seconds, which is more than enough time for the `fetch_data` coroutine to complete. When `fetch_data` completes, it prints "Processing Data". After that, the `main` function finishes by printing "Main function done".

If the `asyncio.sleep(2)` in the `main` function were removed, there would be a race condition where the `process_data` task might not have had enough time to complete before `main` finished and printed "Main function done".
