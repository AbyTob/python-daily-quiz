    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def task(name):
    print(f"Task {name} started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(f"Task {name} finished")

async def main():
    tasks = [task(i) for i in range(3)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The program will output "Task 0 started", then "Task 1 started", and finally "Task 2 finished".
B) The program will output "Task 0 started", then "Task 1 finished", then "Task 2 finished".
C) All three tasks start at the same time, and all finish within approximately 1 second.
D) The order of task completion is not guaranteed.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The program will output "Task 0 started", then "Task 1 finished", then "Task 2 finished".

Explanation: In this code, three tasks are created but the `await asyncio.sleep(1)` inside each task means that only one task runs at a time due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python's threading. Therefore, the output will be "Task 0 started", followed by a delay of about 1 second during which Task 0 runs and completes. Then, since there are no more tasks left, Task 1 starts immediately after Task 0 finishes and also completes after approximately 1 second. The same happens for Task 2. Thus, the order of task completion is guaranteed to be as stated in option B.
