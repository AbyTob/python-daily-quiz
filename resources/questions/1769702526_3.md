    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses decorators and metaclasses together:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name in dir():
            if callable(getattr(cls, attr_name)):
                setattr(cls, attr_name, my_decorator(getattr(cls, attr_name)))
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class MyClass:
    def method1(self):
        print("Executing method1")

    def method2(self):
        print("Executing method2")
```

What will be the output if we create an instance of `MyClass` and call its methods?

A) Nothing is printed

B) "Something is happening before the function is called." is printed once when creating an instance

C) "Something is happening before the function is called." is printed twice, once for each method call

D) "Executing method1" and "Executing method2" are printed without any additional text

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is **C) "Something is happening before the function is called." is printed twice, once for each method call.**

**Explanation:**

- The `Meta` metaclass is used to modify class definitions dynamically.
- When a class is defined using `@Meta`, the metaclass's `__new__` method is invoked.
- In this `__new__` method, it iterates over all attributes of the class (including methods) and wraps them with `my_decorator`.
- This decorator prints "Something is happening before the function is called." every time any method in the class is called.
- Therefore, when you create an instance of `MyClass` and call its methods (`method1` and `method2`), you will see this message printed twice.
