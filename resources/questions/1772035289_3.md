    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to enforce certain properties on class attributes:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if not all(isinstance(val, str) for val in dct.values()):
            raise TypeError("All attribute values must be strings")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    a = 1
    b = "hello"
```

Which of the following statements is true about the `MyClass` and its metaclass?

A) The class will successfully create because all attributes are strings.
B) A `TypeError` will be raised because not all attributes are strings.
C) The metaclass has no effect, and the class will be created normally.
D) The program will crash due to a syntax error in the attribute assignments.
    
    ## Answer
    B) A `TypeError` will be raised because not all attributes are strings.

The `Meta` class enforces that all attribute values must be strings. In the `MyClass`, the attribute `a` is an integer, which does not meet the condition specified by the metaclass. Therefore, a `TypeError` will be raised when `MyClass` is attempted to be created.
