    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_task(task_id):
    print(f"Task {task_id} started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(f"Task {task_id} completed")

async def main():
    tasks = [async_task(i) for i in range(5)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The tasks will run concurrently, and each task will take 1 second to complete.  
B) All tasks will start immediately, but since they are async, they will all finish at the same time after 1 second.  
C) Only one task will run at a time, taking 5 seconds in total.  
D) The code will not run because `asyncio.gather` is missing.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Correct

Explanation:
- In the provided code, `async_task` functions are created asynchronously using `async def`.
- When these tasks are added to a list and passed to `asyncio.gather`, they are scheduled to run concurrently.
- Each task will take 1 second to complete because of the `await asyncio.sleep(1)` statement. Since they are running concurrently, all tasks will finish after approximately 1 second each, totaling around 5 seconds for all tasks combined.
