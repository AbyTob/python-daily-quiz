    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a metaclass to create a class that automatically adds a method `say_hello` to any subclass:

```python
# Define a metaclass that adds a 'say_hello' method to subclasses
class MetaSayHello(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['say_hello'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Use the metaclass to create a base class that includes 'say_hello'
class BaseClass(metaclass=MetaSayHello):
    pass

# Create a subclass of BaseClass
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass
```

Which of the following statements is true about the behavior of `MyClass` when an instance of it is created?

A) Creating an instance of `MyClass` will raise a TypeError because `say_hello` has not been explicitly defined in `MyClass`.

B) Instances of `MyClass` have a method `say_hello` that returns "Hello from MyClass".

C) The metaclass does not affect the creation of `MyClass`, and it behaves like any other class without the `say_hello` method.

D) None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    B) Instances of `MyClass` have a method `say_hello` that returns "Hello from MyClass".

**Explanation:** The metaclass `MetaSayHello` is designed to automatically add a `say_hello` method to any class it is used with. When `MyClass` is created as a subclass of `BaseClass`, the metaclass modifies its dictionary (`dct`) by adding the `say_hello` method. Therefore, instances of `MyClass` will have this method, and calling `say_hello()` on an instance of `MyClass` will return "Hello from MyClass".
