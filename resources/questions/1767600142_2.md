    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that utilizes metaclasses and asyncio:

```python
import asyncio

class Meta(type):
    async def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Add an asynchronous method to any class using this metaclass
        async def my_async_method(self):
            print(f"Hello from {name}!")
        
        dct['my_async_method'] = my_async_method
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

async def main():
    obj = MyClass()
    await obj.my_async_method()

# Uncomment the following line to run the code
# asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what this code does and how it works?

A) It defines a metaclass `Meta` that adds an asynchronous method named `my_async_method` to any class using it. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, calling `my_async_method()` will print "Hello from MyClass!".

B) It defines a metaclass `Meta` that attempts to add an asynchronous method named `my_async_method` to any class using it, but it fails because async methods cannot be added dynamically in Python 3.x.

C) It defines a metaclass `Meta` that adds a synchronous method named `my_async_method` to any class using it. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, calling `my_async_method()` will print "Hello from MyClass!".

D) It attempts to use asyncio's run loop directly within the metaclass definition, which results in a syntax error.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Correct

Explanation:
- The code defines a custom metaclass named `Meta` that dynamically adds an asynchronous method `my_async_method` to any class it is applied to.
- This allows instances of classes using this metaclass (`MyClass`, in this case) to call `my_async_method()`, which will print "Hello from MyClass!" when awaited.
- The use of `async def __new__` within the metaclass ensures that the asynchronous method is properly created and attached to the class.
