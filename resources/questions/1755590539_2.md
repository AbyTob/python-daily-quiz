**Part 1 (Question):**
Consider the following Python code snippet that involves a decorator, metaclass, and a context manager:

```python
from contextlib import ContextManager

def log_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

class LogMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = log_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class LoggedClass(metaclass=LogMeta):
    def method1(self, x):
        return x * 2

    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering LoggedClass")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting LoggedClass")

@contextmanager
def logged_manager():
    print("Entering context manager")
    yield
    print("Exiting context manager")
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) When an instance of `LoggedClass` is created and its `method1` is called, no logs are printed due to the decorator not being applied.

B) The `log_decorator` correctly logs all callable attributes within `LoggedClass`, but `logged_manager` does not log any entries or exits.

C) Both `logged_manager` and methods in `LoggedClass` use a metaclass for decoration, resulting in a conflict that prevents proper execution.

D) When entering and exiting the `logged_manager` context manager, logs are printed as expected.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
B) The `log_decorator` correctly logs all callable attributes within `LoggedClass`, but `logged_manager` does not log any entries or exits.

**Explanation:** 
- The `LogMeta` metaclass correctly applies the `log_decorator` to all callable attributes of classes it creates, including `method1`.
- However, the `logged_manager` is a context manager that uses Python's built-in `@contextmanager` decorator. It logs entering and exiting the context as intended but does not use any metaclass or decoration mechanism like the methods in `LoggedClass`.

This question tests the ability to distinguish between different types of decorators (class-based vs. function-based) and how they interact with metaclasses.
