    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a simple metaclass to ensure that all subclasses of a specific class are registered in a list:

```python
class Registry(type):
    _registry = {}

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        instance = super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        cls._registry[name] = instance
        return instance

class Base(metaclass=Registry):
    pass

class A(Base):
    pass

class B(Base):
    pass
```

What will happen if we try to create another subclass of `Base` after the current ones?

A) The subclass will be registered in the `_registry`.

B) An error will occur because the metaclass already has all subclasses registered.

C) Nothing will happen; the metaclass remains unchanged.

D) All previous registrations will be cleared before adding the new subclass.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The subclass will be registered in the `_registry`.

Explanation: When a subclass of `Base` is created, the `Registry` metaclass's `__new__` method is invoked. This method adds each new subclass to its `_registry`. Therefore, creating another subclass of `Base` after `A` and `B` will result in those subclasses being added to the `_registry`, making option A the correct answer.
