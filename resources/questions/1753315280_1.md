# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a class with a custom attribute:
```python
class CustomMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['custom_attr'] = 'Hello, World!'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=CustomMeta):
    pass

instance = MyClass()
print(instance.custom_attr)
```
What does the above code print when run?

A) TypeError: __new__() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
B) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'custom_attr'
C) Hello, World!
D) None
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
C) Hello, World!

The correct answer is C. The `CustomMeta` metaclass adds a new attribute `custom_attr` to the class it creates with the value 'Hello, World!'. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and its `custom_attr` accessed, it correctly prints 'Hello, World!'.
