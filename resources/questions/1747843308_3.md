    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return asyncio.run(self.func(*args, **kwargs))

@AsyncDecorator
async def async_task():
    print("Task started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Task completed")

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(async_task())
print(result)
```

What will be the output of this code?

A) Task started  
   Task completed  
   None  

B) Task started  
   Task completed  

C) Task started  
   Task completed  
   Future object at 0x...  

D) Error: Cannot run inside async context
    
    ## Answer
    A) Task started  
   Task completed  
   None  

Explanation:
- The `AsyncDecorator` is a class that takes an asynchronous function (`async_task`) as its argument.
- When the decorated function is called, it uses `asyncio.run()` to execute the asynchronous function in a new event loop. This is necessary because `asyncio.run()` is used for running top-level entry point coroutines and should be called only once per program.
- Inside `async_task`, an asyncio sleep of 1 second is simulated using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`.
- When `async_task` completes, the function prints "Task completed".
- Since the result of `async_task` is not explicitly returned or captured, it defaults to `None`. Therefore, the final printed output is `Task started`, `Task completed`, and `None`.

This question tests the understanding of how to properly run asynchronous functions using a decorator that handles the event loop management.
