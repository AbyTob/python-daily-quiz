# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncLogger:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename

    async def log(self, message):
        with open(self.filename, 'a') as file:
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate IO delay
            file.write(message + '\n')

async def main():
    logger = AsyncLogger('log.txt')
    tasks = [logger.log(f'Message {i}') for i in range(5)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

What is a potential issue with this implementation that could affect its performance?

A) It doesn't handle exceptions during file writing.
B) The `await asyncio.sleep(0.1)` call will block other tasks from running.
C) Writing to a file in an asynchronous context might not be thread-safe if multiple threads access it simultaneously.
D) There is no way to ensure that all messages are written before the program exits.
    
    ## Answer
    A) It doesn't handle exceptions during file writing.
