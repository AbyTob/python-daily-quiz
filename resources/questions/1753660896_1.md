# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):  
Consider the following code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses together:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'method' not in dct:
            raise TypeError(f"Class {name} must have a method.")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Decorator called")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@Meta
class MyClass:
    @decorator
    def method(self):
        print("Method called")

obj = MyClass()
obj.method()
```

What will be the output when the `method` of `MyClass` is called?

A) Decorator called  
   Method called  

B) Method called  
   Decorator called  

C) TypeError: Class MyClass must have a method  

D) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'method'
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):  
A) Decorator called  
   Method called  

Explanation:  
The `decorator` is applied to the `method` before the `Meta` metaclass is invoked. Therefore, when `obj.method()` is called, it first executes the decorator, printing "Decorator called", and then proceeds to call the original method, printing "Method called". The metaclass `Meta` checks that the class has a method named 'method', which exists in this case, so no errors are raised during its execution.
