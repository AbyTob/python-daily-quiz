    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, timeout):
        self.timeout = timeout
    
    async def __aenter__(self):
        print(f"Starting timer for {self.timeout} seconds...")
        await asyncio.sleep(self.timeout)
        return "Timer finished"
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        if exc_type:
            print(f"An exception occurred: {exc_value}")
        else:
            print("Timer completed successfully")
        return False

async def main():
    try:
        result = await AsyncTimer(3)
        print(result)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError as e:
        print(f"Timeout error: {e}")

# Uncomment the line below to run the code
# asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this `AsyncTimer` context manager is correct?

A) It correctly implements an asynchronous context manager and handles exceptions properly.

B) It incorrectly handles exceptions within the `__aexit__` method, leading to potential resource leaks.

C) The `async def __aenter__` method does not need to return any value, so the return statement can be omitted.

D) Using this context manager will always result in a timeout exception because the sleep duration is hardcoded and too long.
    
    ## Answer
    A) It correctly implements an asynchronous context manager and handles exceptions properly.
