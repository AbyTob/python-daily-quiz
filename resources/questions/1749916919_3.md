    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to automatically add a `reset` method to any class it decorates. The goal is to understand how this metaclass works and what potential issues might arise from its use.

```python
class AutoResetMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Create a new dictionary for the class
        new_dct = dict(dct)
        
        # Add a reset method to the class
        new_dct['reset'] = lambda self: [setattr(self, attr, 0) for attr in dir(self) if not callable(getattr(self, attr)) and not attr.startswith("__")]
        
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, new_dct)

class Counter(metaclass=AutoResetMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 1
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `reset` method will correctly reset all non-method attributes to zero.

B) The `reset` method will only affect attributes that are explicitly initialized as integers.

C) Using a metaclass in this way can lead to unintended side effects, such as modifying classes defined in other modules.

D) All instance variables of the class will be set to zero when calling `reset`.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
C) Using a metaclass in this way can lead to unintended side effects, such as modifying classes defined in other modules.

**Explanation**: The metaclass `AutoResetMeta` automatically adds a `reset` method to any class it decorates. This method sets all non-callable attributes (excluding magic methods like `__init__`) to zero when called. While this might be useful for certain scenarios, it can have unintended side effects if used on classes that are defined in other modules or are part of larger systems where such modifications could cause issues. Additionally, while the implementation does reset all non-method attributes to zero, not just integer ones, option A is close but not entirely accurate because it implies a type check which isn't present.
