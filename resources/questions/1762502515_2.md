# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code:

```python
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    pass

@MyMeta
class AnotherClass:
    pass
```

What will be printed when running this code?

A) `Creating class MyClass`  
B) `Creating class AnotherClass`  
C) Both `Creating class MyClass` and `Creating class AnotherClass`  
D) Neither of the above

### Part 2 (Answer):
**
    
    ## Answer
    C**

**Detailed Explanation:**  
In Python, metaclasses are the classes used to create other classes. When a class is defined, Python uses its metaclass to construct it. The default metaclass in Python is `type`, but you can specify a different metaclass using the `metaclass` keyword argument in the class definition.

- For `MyClass`, the metaclass specified is `MyMeta`. Therefore, when `MyClass` is defined, the `__new__` method of `MyMeta` is called with arguments: `name='MyClass'`, `bases=()`, and `dct={}`. This results in the print statement `Creating class MyClass`.

- For `AnotherClass`, we use a decorator `@MyMeta`. In Python, decorators are applied to functions or classes at definition time. However, when using a decorator with a metaclass, the decorator actually creates a new class under the hood. The original class is essentially replaced by this new class. Thus, applying `@MyMeta` to `AnotherClass` internally results in creating a new class with `MyMeta` as its metaclass, and then printing `Creating class AnotherClass`.

Both classes result in the print statement being executed due to their respective metaclasses being invoked during their definition.
