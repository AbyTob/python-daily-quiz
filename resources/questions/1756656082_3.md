    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to count the number of times a function is called:

```python
def counter(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        wrapper.count += 1
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    wrapper.count = 0
    return wrapper

@counter
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")

print(greet.count)  # What will this line output?
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior and output of the above code?

A) The decorator `counter` will not increment `wrapper.count` because it's initialized as a non-callable attribute.

B) The output will be `0`, indicating that the `greet` function was not called.

C) The output will be `1`, as only "Alice" was greeted once.

D) The output will be `2`, reflecting that both "Alice" and "Bob" were greeted.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The output will be `0`, indicating that the `greet` function was not called.
