    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a class method `greet` to all classes defined with it:

```python
class GreetMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {name}!"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Person(metaclass=GreetMeta):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

person = Person("Alice")
print(person.greet())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the above code?

A) The `greet` method will not be added to any class defined with the `GreetMeta` metaclass.

B) When a new class is created using `GreetMeta`, it automatically inherits from all base classes passed to it.

C) The `greet` method can be called on any instance of a class that uses `GreetMeta` as its metaclass, and it will return "Hello from <ClassName>!", where `<ClassName>` is the name of the class.

D) If a class inherits from another class that also uses `GreetMeta`, the `greet` method will be duplicated in both classes.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The `greet` method can be called on any instance of a class that uses `GreetMeta` as its metaclass, and it will return "Hello from <ClassName>!", where `<ClassName>` is the name of the class.

Explanation:
- A metaclass in Python is a class whose instances are classes. The `GreetMeta` metaclass defines a new method called `greet` when creating any class that uses it as its metaclass.
- This method is added to each class in its dictionary (`dct`) during the creation of the class by overriding the `__new__` method of `type`.
- Therefore, any instance of a class defined with this metaclass can call `greet`, and it will return the greeting message with the class name dynamically inserted.
- Options A, B, and D are incorrect because:
  - Option A is false because `greet` is indeed added to all classes using `GreetMeta`.
  - Option B is misleading as a metaclass does not change inheritance; it only affects how the class itself is created and configured.
  - Option D is incorrect because the method is not duplicated but rather shared across all instances of the class that use this metaclass.
