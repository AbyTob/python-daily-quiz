    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code using asyncio for asynchronous I/O operations:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching data from {url}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate network delay
    return f"data from {url}"

async def main():
    urls = ["http://example.com", "http://example.org"]
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is incorrect?

A. The `asyncio.sleep(1)` simulates a blocking I/O operation.
B. The `fetch_data` function returns a coroutine object.
C. The `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` will run all tasks concurrently and collect their results.
D. The output order of the results in `main()` is guaranteed to be in the same order as the input URLs.
    
    ## Answer
    B. The `fetch_data` function returns a coroutine object.

Explanation: In Python, when you define an asynchronous function using the `async def` syntax, it does not immediately execute but instead returns a coroutine object that represents the execution of the function. This coroutine object can then be scheduled to run asynchronously using an event loop like in this example with `asyncio.run(main())`. The coroutine itself is not executing until it hits an `await` expression, which it does when calling `await asyncio.sleep(1)`.
