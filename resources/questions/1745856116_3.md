    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

def thread_safe(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        lock = threading.Lock()
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safe
class SharedResource:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1

def thread_function(resource, num_times):
    for _ in range(num_times):
        resource.increment()

resource = SharedResource()
threads = [threading.Thread(target=thread_function, args=(resource, 100)) for _ in range(10)]

for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print(resource.value)
```

What is the expected output of this code? Why does it behave that way?

A) The output will be 1000 because all increments are performed atomically.

B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

C) The output will be more than 1000 due to extra increments caused by thread switching.

D) The program will raise an exception due to improper use of the lock.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The output will be less than 1000 because multiple threads might read and write to `value` concurrently, leading to a race condition.

Explanation:
- The decorator `@thread_safe` is intended to ensure that the `increment` method of `SharedResource` is thread-safe by using a lock.
- However, the lock object is created inside the wrapper function for each call. This means that each `increment` call will use its own separate lock instead of sharing the same one across threads.
- Since each thread uses its own lock and does not block other threads from reading and writing to `value`, race conditions can still occur.
- Therefore, the final value of `resource.value` will be less than 1000, as multiple increments might be incorrectly applied.
