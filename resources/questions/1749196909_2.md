    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to automatically add a method to any class it decorates:

```python
# Define a metaclass that adds a new method to classes it decorates
class AddMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Create a new method and add it to the dictionary
        dct['added_method'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Apply the metaclass to a class
@AddMethodMeta()
class MyClass:
    pass

# Create an instance of MyClass and call the added method
instance = MyClass()
print(instance.added_method())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `MyClass` will not have the `added_method` because metaclasses are only used during class creation.

B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot add methods dynamically after class creation.

C) The `added_method` will be added to any subclass of `MyClass`, not just instances of `MyClass`.

D) The `added_method` will correctly print "Hello from MyClass" when called on an instance of `MyClass`.
    
    ## Answer
    D) The `added_method` will correctly print "Hello from MyClass" when called on an instance of `MyClass`.

Explanation: Metaclasses are executed during the class creation process. By using a metaclass to modify the dictionary (`dct`) passed to `__new__`, we can dynamically add methods to any class that uses this metaclass, regardless of whether it is a subclass or not. Therefore, when an instance of `MyClass` calls `added_method()`, it will correctly print "Hello from MyClass".
