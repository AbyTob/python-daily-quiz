    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses asyncio for asynchronous programming:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncWorker:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    async def task(self):
        print(f"Starting {self.name}")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print(f"Finished {self.name}")

async def main():
    worker1 = AsyncWorker("Worker 1")
    worker2 = AsyncWorker("Worker 2")
    
    await asyncio.gather(worker1.task(), worker2.task())

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the output of this code if you run it?

A) Starting Worker 1, Finished Worker 1, Starting Worker 2, Finished Worker 2  
B) Starting Worker 1, Starting Worker 2, Finished Worker 1, Finished Worker 2  
C) Starting Worker 1, Starting Worker 2  
D) Starting Worker 1, Finished Worker 2, Starting Worker 2, Finished Worker 1
    
    ## Answer
    A) Starting Worker 1, Finished Worker 1, Starting Worker 2, Finished Worker 2
