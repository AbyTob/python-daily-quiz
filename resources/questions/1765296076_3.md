    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data fetched"

async def process_data(data):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Processed: {data}"

async def main():
    data = await fetch_data()
    processed_data = await process_data(data)
    print(processed_data)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the behavior of this asynchronous program?

A) The `fetch_data` and `process_data` functions are executed concurrently.
B) The entire `main` function runs synchronously, blocking all operations.
C) The `await` keyword is used to pause execution until the awaited task completes.
D) Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents any parallelism in this code.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The `await` keyword is used to pause execution until the awaited task completes.
