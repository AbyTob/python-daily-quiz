    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

@Singleton
class DatabaseConnection:
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to the database...")

def use_database():
    db1 = DatabaseConnection()
    db2 = DatabaseConnection()
    
    db1.connect()
    db2.connect()

use_database()
```

What is the output of the `use_database` function? Explain why.

A) Connecting to the database... Connecting to the database...
B) Connecting to the database...
C) Error: Maximum recursion depth exceeded
D) None
    
    ## Answer
    A) Connecting to the database...

Explanation: The Singleton metaclass ensures that only one instance of `DatabaseConnection` is created. When `use_database` is called, both `db1` and `db2` refer to the same instance, so calling `connect` on either will print "Connecting to the database..." only once.
