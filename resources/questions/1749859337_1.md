    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to measure execution time of a function:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(1, n+1))

# Usage
total = compute_sum(1000000)
print(total)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `compute_sum` function will execute faster with the decorator applied.

B) The execution time of `compute_sum` is measured in milliseconds.

C) The decorator `timer` can be used to measure the execution time of any function, regardless of its complexity.

D) Applying the `timer` decorator increases memory usage due to additional function calls.

### Part 2 (Answer)
**A) The `compute_sum` function will execute faster with the decorator applied.**

**Explanation:** This is incorrect because adding a decorator that measures execution time will introduce some overhead, which can potentially slow down the function's execution if it's already optimized. The decorator adds a small cost by recording and calculating the time before and after the function call.

**B) The execution time of `compute_sum` is measured in milliseconds.**

**Explanation:** This statement is incorrect because the `time.time()` function returns the current time in seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970). While it provides high resolution, it does not directly measure in milliseconds.

**C) The decorator `timer` can be used to measure the execution time of any function, regardless of its complexity.**

**Explanation:** This statement is correct. Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code. The `timer` decorator can be applied to any function to measure how long it takes to execute.

**D) Applying the `timer` decorator increases memory usage due to additional function calls.**

**Explanation:** This statement is partially correct. While applying a decorator does introduce additional function calls, which can affect performance and potentially increase memory usage slightly, the impact is generally minimal for most use cases. More significant changes would be expected in terms of execution time rather than memory usage.
