    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.func(*args, **kwargs)

@AsyncDecorator
async def my_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Async function completed")

# Usage
asyncio.run(my_async_function())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator does not modify the behavior of `my_async_function`.

B) The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator wraps `my_async_function` in a way that it can be used with `asyncio.run()`.

C) The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator will raise an error when trying to run `my_async_function`.

D) The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator ensures that `my_async_function` runs synchronously, ignoring the `await asyncio.sleep(1)` call.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

B) The `@AsyncDecorator` decorator wraps `my_async_function` in a way that it can be used with `asyncio.run()`.

**Explanation:**
The `@AsyncDecorator` class is designed to accept an asynchronous function (`my_async_function`) and simply call it. This does not change the fact that `my_async_function` is still an async function, meaning it requires proper execution through an event loop like `asyncio.run()`. Thus, using `@AsyncDecorator` does not alter the fundamental nature of `my_async_function`; it remains a coroutine, which can only be executed in an asyncio context. Therefore, calling `my_async_function()` directly outside of an async context or without wrapping it in an appropriate event loop will raise an error unless `my_async_function` is defined as a regular function rather than an async one.
