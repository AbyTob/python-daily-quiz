    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct["add"] = lambda self, x: x + 5
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
result = obj.add(10)
print(result)
```

What will be the output of this code?

A) 10  
B) 15  
C) 20  
D) TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) 15

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` modifies any class it decorates by adding a method `add` that takes an argument and returns the argument incremented by 5.
- When `MyClass` is defined with `metaclass=Meta`, the metaclass's `__new__` method is called to create the class, and the `add` method is added to the class dictionary.
- An instance of `MyClass` is created and the `add` method is called on this instance with the argument 10.
- The output of `obj.add(10)` is therefore `15`, as expected.
