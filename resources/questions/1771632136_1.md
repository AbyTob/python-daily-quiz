# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following code snippet that aims to create a decorator to measure the execution time of a function:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the `compute_sum` function when decorated with the `timer` decorator?

A) The execution time of `compute_sum` is printed each time it is called.
B) The `wrapper` function replaces the original `compute_sum` function entirely.
C) The `timer` decorator does not change the behavior of the `compute_sum` function.
D) The `compute_sum` function will not execute if the `timer` decorator is applied.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) The execution time of `compute_sum` is printed each time it is called.

Explanation:
The `timer` decorator wraps the `compute_sum` function with a `wrapper` function. Each time `compute_sum` is called, it goes through the wrapper, which measures the time taken for its execution and prints this information before returning the result of `compute_sum`. Therefore, the execution time is printed each time `compute_sum` is called, making option A correct.

Option B is incorrect because while the `wrapper` function effectively calls the original `compute_sum`, it does not replace it entirely; rather, it adds additional functionality (the timing) around the call to the original function.
Option C is false as the decorator alters the behavior of the function by adding new functionality (time measurement), so the original function's behavior changes.
Option D is incorrect because the decorator can be applied without affecting the execution of the decorated function; it simply adds additional behavior during its execution.
