# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncCounter:
    def __init__(self, start=0):
        self.value = start
    
    async def increment(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        self.value += 1
        print(f"Current value: {self.value}")

async def main():
    counter = AsyncCounter(0)
    tasks = [counter.increment() for _ in range(5)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this program? Explain why.

**Options:**
A) The value will increment by 1 every second and print each value
B) The value will increment by 5 but only one value will be printed at a time
C) The value will not increment and no values will be printed
D) An exception will be raised
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

**A) The value will increment by 1 every second and print each value**

Explanation:
The code creates an instance of `AsyncCounter` with an initial value of 0. It then creates a list of tasks, each calling the `increment` method on the counter. Since `asyncio.sleep(0.1)` is used within the `increment` method, there is a delay of 0.1 seconds between increments. However, because these calls are all awaited concurrently using `await asyncio.gather(*tasks)`, they will start almost simultaneously and finish in quick succession, leading to an output where each value from 1 to 5 is printed almost immediately after the previous one, giving the impression that the values are incremented by 1 every second.
