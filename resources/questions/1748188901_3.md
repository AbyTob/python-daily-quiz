    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code using asyncio for asynchronous operations:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncWorker:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    async def work(self):
        print(f"{self.name} starts working")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print(f"{self.name} finishes working")

async def main():
    workers = [AsyncWorker(f"Worker {i}") for i in range(5)]
    tasks = [worker.work() for worker in workers]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `work` method is executed synchronously.
B) All workers start working immediately upon calling `main`.
C) The `asyncio.sleep(1)` call blocks other tasks from running concurrently.
D) The output will always be "Worker 0 starts working", followed by a delay, then all other workers' messages.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The `asyncio.sleep(1)` call blocks other tasks from running concurrently.

Explanation: In the given code, `await asyncio.sleep(1)` is used to simulate an I/O operation that would block if it were run synchronously. However, because the tasks are awaited using `asyncio.gather`, Python's event loop allows other tasks to run while waiting for the sleep to complete. Therefore, not all workers start working immediately, and they do not block each other during the sleep phase.
