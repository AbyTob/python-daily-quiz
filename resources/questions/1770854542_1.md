    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class SingletonClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Usage
a = SingletonClass(10)
b = SingletonClass(20)
```

Which of the following statements is true about the `SingletonClass` and its usage?

A) The values of `a.value` and `b.value` are both 10 because the singleton ensures that only one instance can be created.
B) The values of `a.value` and `b.value` are 10 and 20 respectively, demonstrating that instances can be distinct.
C) An error is raised when trying to create a second instance of `SingletonClass`.
D) The `SingletonMeta` metaclass does not ensure that only one instance can be created.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The values of `a.value` and `b.value` are both 10 because the singleton ensures that only one instance can be created.

Explanation:
The provided code defines a `SingletonMeta` metaclass that uses a class variable `_instances` to store instances of the classes it decorates. When an instance is created, the metaclass checks if an instance already exists for the class being instantiated. If it does not, it creates a new one and stores it in `_instances`. The next time an instance is requested, it returns the existing instance.

In the usage example:
```python
a = SingletonClass(10)
b = SingletonClass(20)
```
The first line creates an instance of `SingletonClass` with `value=10` and stores it in `_instances`. The second line attempts to create another instance but since the singleton ensures only one instance per class, the existing instance is returned. Therefore, both `a` and `b` refer to the same instance, and `b.value` is overwritten by the value assigned during its creation.

Thus, option A is correct because it correctly describes the behavior of the singleton pattern implemented by the metaclass.
