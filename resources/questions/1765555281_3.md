Part 1 (Question): You are tasked with optimizing the performance of a web application that processes a large number of requests. The current implementation uses synchronous I/O operations, which are blocking and lead to inefficient use of resources. You decide to implement asynchronous handling using asyncio to improve performance.

Write an asyncio-based function `fetch_data` that performs a GET request to a URL and returns the response content. Use Python's `aiohttp` library for making HTTP requests asynchronously. Ensure that your function handles exceptions gracefully and logs any errors that occur during the request.

Here is a skeleton of the function you need to complete:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Example usage:
# loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
# result = loop.run_until_complete(fetch_data('http://example.com'))
# print(result)
```
