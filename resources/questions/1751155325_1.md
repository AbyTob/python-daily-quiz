    ## Answer
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that demonstrates a custom metaclass designed to enhance a class by adding a method `log_access` that logs every attribute access:

```python
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name in dct:
            if callable(dct[attr_name]):
                setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_access(attr_name, dct[attr_name]))
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def log_access(method_name, method):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Accessing {method_name}")
            return method(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

class MyClass(metaclass=LoggingMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 42

    def display(self):
        print(self.value)

# Usage
obj = MyClass()
obj.display()  # Should output: Accessing display
               #         42
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `LoggingMeta` metaclass automatically logs all attribute accesses for any method in a class it decorates.

B) The `log_access` static method transforms every callable (method or function) in a decorated class into a version that logs its access before executing.

C) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `__init__` method does not log its execution because it is not a callable.

D) Using this metaclass, all attribute accesses within any class using it would be logged, but only if they are explicitly defined in the `__dict__`.

Part 2 (Answer):
B) The `log_access` static method transforms every callable (method or function) in a decorated class into a version that logs its access before executing.

This statement is correct. The `LoggingMeta` metaclass uses ` setattr(dct, attr_name, cls.log_access(attr_name, dct[attr_name]))` to replace each method with a wrapped version of itself that logs access before calling the original method. Therefore, every callable attribute in a class decorated with `LoggingMeta` will log its access when called, not just methods explicitly defined in the `__dict__`.
