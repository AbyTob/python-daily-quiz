# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses together:

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'my_method' in dct:
            orig_my_method = dct['my_method']
            
            @wraps(orig_my_method)
            def new_my_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
                print("Something is happening before my_method is called.")
                return orig_my_method(self, *args, **kwargs)
            dct['my_method'] = new_my_method
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    def my_method(self):
        print("my_method has been called.")

@my_decorator
def my_function():
    print("Function has been called.")
```

Which of the following statements is true about the behavior of the `MyClass` and `my_function` when they are invoked?

A) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, "Something is happening before the function is called." will be printed.
B) When an instance of `MyClass` calls `my_method`, "Something is happening before my_method is called." will be printed.
C) When `my_function` is called, "Function has been called." will be printed first, followed by "Something is happening before the function is called."
D) None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When an instance of `MyClass` calls `my_method`, "Something is happening before my_method is called." will be printed.

Explanation:
- The `MyMeta` metaclass intercepts class creation and checks if `my_method` exists in the class dictionary. If it does, it wraps the method with additional functionality that prints a message.
- The `my_decorator` decorator wraps any function it decorates with an additional print statement.
- When an instance of `MyClass` calls `my_method`, due to metaclass intervention, "Something is happening before my_method is called." is printed first. Then, the original `my_method` functionality ("my_method has been called.") is executed.
