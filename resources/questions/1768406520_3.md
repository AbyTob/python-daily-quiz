    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MySingleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Create two instances of MySingleton
instance1 = MySingleton()
instance2 = MySingleton()

print(instance1 is instance2)  # Should print True
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A. Each time `MySingleton` is instantiated, a new instance is created.

B. The metaclass `SingletonMeta` ensures that only one instance of `MySingleton` can exist at any given time.

C. The `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` is called whenever `MySingleton()` is called, but it does not affect the instantiation process.

D. Memory usage increases with each instantiation of `MySingleton` because a new instance is created each time.
    
    ## Answer
    B. The metaclass `SingletonMeta` ensures that only one instance of `MySingleton` can exist at any given time.

Explanation: In this code, the `SingletonMeta` metaclass overrides the `__call__` method to control how instances of `MySingleton` are created. When an instance of `MySingleton` is requested (e.g., by calling `MySingleton()`), the `__call__` method checks if an instance already exists in `_instances`. If it does, the existing instance is returned; otherwise, a new instance is created and stored in `_instances`. This ensures that all references to `MySingleton` point to the same object, thus maintaining a singleton pattern.
