    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a decorator for asynchronous functions. The goal is to log the execution time of each asynchronous function it decorates.

```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps

def async_time_logger(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} executed in {end - start:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@async_time_logger
async def example_coroutine():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await example_coroutine()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when running this code?

A) The `example_coroutine` will run and print the execution time.

B) An error occurs because `async_time_logger` is not an asynchronous function.

C) The code will hang indefinitely without printing anything.

D) A TypeError is raised because `@async_time_logger` cannot be used with synchronous functions.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)
**A) The `example_coroutine` will run and print the execution time.**

**Explanation:** The decorator `async_time_logger` correctly wraps the asynchronous function `example_coroutine`. Inside the wrapper, it accurately measures the start and end times using `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()`, calculates the execution time, and prints it before returning the result of the original coroutine. When you run this code, it will execute the `example_coroutine` and print its execution time to the console.
