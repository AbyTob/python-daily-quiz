    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, timeout):
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.result = None
    
    async def run(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(self.timeout)
        self.result = "Timer completed"
    
    async def get_result(self):
        return self.result

async def main():
    timer = AsyncTimer(3)
    task = asyncio.create_task(timer.run())
    await asyncio.gather(task)
    result = await timer.get_result()
    print(result)

# Run the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the purpose of using `asyncio` in this code, and what will be printed to the console when the program completes?

A) The code uses `asyncio` for threading; "Timer completed" will be printed.

B) The code uses `asyncio` to run asynchronous tasks; "Timer completed" will be printed.

C) The code uses `asyncio` for multiprocessing; "Timer completed" will be printed.

D) The code uses `asyncio` for memory management; "Timer completed" will be printed.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The code uses `asyncio` to run asynchronous tasks; "Timer completed" will be printed.

Explanation: In this example, the `AsyncTimer` class defines two asynchronous methods: `run`, which simulates a timer by sleeping for a specified duration, and `get_result`, which retrieves the result of the timer. The `main` function creates an instance of `AsyncTimer`, runs it in a separate task using `asyncio.create_task()`, waits for all tasks to complete with `asyncio.gather()`, and then prints the result. Since the timer completes after 3 seconds, "Timer completed" will be printed to the console.
