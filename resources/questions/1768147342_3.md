    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses together:

```python
from functools import wraps

def decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Decorator called")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr in dct.items():
            if callable(attr):
                dct[attr_name] = decorator(attr)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def method1(self):
        print("Method 1 called")

    @staticmethod
    def static_method2():
        print("Static Method 2 called")
```

What will be the output when you create an instance of `MyClass` and call its methods, and how does this demonstrate the use of decorators and metaclasses?

A) "Decorator called", "Method 1 called"  
B) "Decorator called", "Static Method 2 called"  
C) "Decorator called" (twice), "Method 1 called"  
D) Error: Decorators cannot be applied to static methods

**Part 2 (Answer):**  
A) "Decorator called", "Method 1 called"

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` intercepts the creation of `MyClass`. When it does so, it iterates through all attributes of `MyClass`.
- If an attribute is callable (i.e., a method or function), it wraps that callable with the `decorator` using `@wraps` to preserve the original metadata.
- Therefore, when you create an instance of `MyClass` and call `method1`, the output will be "Decorator called" followed by "Method 1 called".
- Similarly, calling `static_method2` directly on the class (as it's a static method) also triggers the decorator before executing the method body, resulting in "Decorator called" before "Static Method 2 called".

This example demonstrates how decorators and metaclasses can be used together to modify behavior at both the attribute level (through metaclass action) and the callable function level (through direct application of decorators).
