    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def slow_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Function completed"

async def fast_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
    return "Function completed"

async def run_functions(fns):
    results = []
    for fn in fns:
        result = await fn()
        results.append(result)
    return results

async def main():
    tasks = [slow_function(), fast_function()]
    final_results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(final_results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the expected output of this script when executed?

A) ['Function completed', 'Function completed']
B) ['Function completed', None]
C) [None, 'Function completed']
D) An error because `asyncio.gather` cannot handle multiple coroutines at once
    
    ## Answer
    [A] ['Function completed', 'Function completed']

Explanation: The script defines two asynchronous functions, `slow_function` and `fast_function`, which simulate operations that take 1 second and 0.5 seconds respectively. The `run_functions` coroutine is designed to run a list of coroutines concurrently using `asyncio.gather`. Since both tasks are capable of running simultaneously, the output will reflect the completion of all tasks as expected.
