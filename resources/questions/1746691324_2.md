    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a singleton class using both decorators and metaclasses. However, it does not function as intended:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super(SingletonMeta, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}

    @wraps(cls)
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    return get_instance

@singleton
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 42

# Create two instances of MyClass
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Expected output: True
```

What is the issue with the above code, and how would you correct it to ensure that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created?

A) The decorator is not properly used within the metaclass.
B) Both the metaclass and the decorator are incorrectly trying to manage instances.
C) The metaclass's `__call__` method is incorrectly overriding the decorator's functionality.
D) The use of `@wraps(cls)` in the decorator is unnecessary and causing issues.

Part 2 (Answer):
B) Both the metaclass and the decorator are incorrectly trying to manage instances.

Explanation:
The issue with the provided code lies in its attempt to combine singleton patterns using both a metaclass (`SingletonMeta`) and a decorator (`singleton`). Each of these methods tries to manage the instance creation, leading to conflicts when an instance is created through one method (metaclass) and later attempted again through another (decorator). The correct approach would be to use either the metaclass or the decorator but not both. If using a metaclass, it should handle all instance creation logic within its `__call__` method. If using a decorator, it should manage instances outside of class definitions and apply it to methods that need to return singleton instances rather than applying it directly to the class.
