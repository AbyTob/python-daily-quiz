    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    async def increment(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        self.count += 1

async def main():
    counter = AsyncCounter()
    tasks = [counter.increment() for _ in range(5)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(counter.count)

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be printed when this code is executed, and why?

A) 0  
B) 1  
C) 2  
D) 5
    
    ## Answer
    D) 5  

Explanation: The code uses an asynchronous counter where `increment` increments a count after waiting for 1 second. When `main` is run with five tasks, each task waits 1 second before incrementing the counter. By the time all tasks complete and the final value of `count` is printed, it will have been incremented five times (once by each task), resulting in a final count of 5.
