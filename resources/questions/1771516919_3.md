    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure all instances of a class have a unique identifier:

```python
class UniqueMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=UniqueMeta):
    pass

# Create instances of MyClass
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Output: True
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `UniqueMeta` metaclass ensures that each class has only one instance, regardless of how many times it's instantiated.

B) The `_instances` dictionary is used to store instances of classes with unique identifiers.

C) The `__call__` method in `UniqueMeta` checks if an instance already exists before creating a new one, ensuring uniqueness.

D) All classes inheriting from `MyClass` will have their instances stored in the `_instances` dictionary.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The `__call__` method in `UniqueMeta` checks if an instance already exists before creating a new one, ensuring uniqueness.

Explanation: The metaclass `UniqueMeta` overrides the `__call__` method to control the object creation process. It uses a class variable `_instances` to store instances of classes it has created. If an instance does not exist for a given class, it creates a new one and stores it in `_instances`. This ensures that any instantiation of a class using this metaclass will return the same instance if it already exists, thus achieving uniqueness across all instances of different classes.
