    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a default method to all classes defined with this metaclass:

```python
class DefaultMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['default_method'] = lambda self: "Default Method Called"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=DefaultMethodMeta):
    pass

class AnotherClass(metaclass=DefaultMethodMeta):
    def custom_method(self):
        return "Custom Method Called"

obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = AnotherClass()

print(obj1.default_method())
print(obj2.default_method())
print(obj2.custom_method())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the output of this code?

A) `Default Method Called` will be printed twice, and `Custom Method Called` will also be printed.

B) `Default Method Called` will be printed three times.

C) `Custom Method Called` will be printed once, and `Default Method Called` will be printed twice.

D) An error will occur because `AnotherClass` does not have a method called `default_method`.
    
    ## Answer
    A) `Default Method Called` will be printed twice, and `Custom Method Called` will also be printed.

Explanation: When classes `MyClass` and `AnotherClass` are defined with the metaclass `DefaultMethodMeta`, they both receive an additional method `default_method` that returns "Default Method Called". The `AnotherClass` defines its own method `custom_method`, which is not affected by the metaclass. Therefore, when calling `obj1.default_method()` and `obj2.default_method()`, "Default Method Called" is printed twice. Calling `obj2.custom_method()` results in "Custom Method Called".
