    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a class decorator. The goal is to add a method to any class decorated by this metaclass that prints "Hello, World!" when called.

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        super().__init__(name, bases, dct)
        cls.greet = lambda self: print("Hello, World!")

@Meta()
class MyClass:
    pass

# Usage
my_instance = MyClass()
my_instance.greet()  # Expected output: Hello, World!
```

Which of the following statements is true about the code above?

A) The `greet` method is added to `MyClass` dynamically at runtime.

B) The `Meta` metaclass does not modify `MyClass` in any way.

C) Calling `my_instance.greet()` will raise an AttributeError because `greet` is not defined in `MyClass`.

D) The code will not run because there is a syntax error in the `Meta` class definition.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `greet` method is added to `MyClass` dynamically at runtime.

Explanation: 
- When `MyClass` is decorated with `@Meta()`, the metaclass `Meta` is invoked. 
- In the `__init__` method of `Meta`, a new method `greet` is added to the class `cls` being initialized (which in this case is `MyClass`).
- This allows instances of `MyClass` to call the `greet` method, which prints "Hello, World!".
- The other options are incorrect because:
  - Option B is false because the metaclass does add a method to the class.
  - Option C is false because the `greet` method is defined and can be called.
  - Option D is false as there are no syntax errors in the provided code.
