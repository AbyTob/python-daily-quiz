    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that aims to implement a simple cache decorator using a metaclass:

```python
import time

class CacheMeta(type):
    _cache = {}

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'get' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Missing get method")
        dct['cached_get'] = cls._create_cached_method(dct.pop('get'))
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def _create_cached_method(func):
        def cached_func(*args, **kwargs):
            if args in CacheMeta._cache:
                print("Cache hit")
                return CacheMeta._cache[args]
            else:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                CacheMeta._cache[args] = result
                time.sleep(2)  # Simulating computation time
                return result
        return cached_func

class CachedClass(metaclass=CacheMeta):
    def get(self, key):
        # Simulate a computationally expensive operation
        return sum(i * i for i in range(key))

# Usage
obj = CachedClass()
print(obj.cached_get(10))  # First call should compute
print(obj.cached_get(10))  # Second call should use cache
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and limitations of this `CachedClass` implementation?

A) The first call to `cached_get(10)` will take 2 seconds, but subsequent calls with the same argument will be instant due to caching.  
B) Both calls to `cached_get(10)` will take 2 seconds because the cache is not properly implemented.  
C) Calling `get` directly without using `cached_get` bypasses the cache.  
D) The class cannot be instantiated as it lacks an implementation for the required method.
    
    ## Answer
    D) The class cannot be instantiated as it lacks an implementation for the required method.

**Explanation:** The code defines a metaclass `CacheMeta` that adds a caching mechanism to any class using it. However, the `get` method is not properly defined in the `CachedClass`. The metaclass checks for the presence of a `get` method during class creation and raises a `TypeError` if it's missing. Since `CachedClass` does not define a `get` method, attempting to instantiate it will result in a `TypeError`.
