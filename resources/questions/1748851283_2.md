    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to dynamically modify a class:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if not issubclass(name, ABC) and 'abstract_method' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Non-abstract classes must implement an abstract method.")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def abstract_method(self):
        pass

# Attempt to create a class that inherits from MyClass but does not implement the abstract method.
try:
    class MyConcreteClass(MyClass):
        pass
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```

What will be printed when running this code?

A) "Non-abstract classes must implement an abstract method."  
B) "TypeError: 'MyConcreteClass' object has no attribute 'abstract_method'"  
C) "No output"  
D) The program will crash
    
    ## Answer
    A) "Non-abstract classes must implement an abstract method."
