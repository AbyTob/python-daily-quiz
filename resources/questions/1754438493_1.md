# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to modify a class's method:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def my_function(n):
    return sum(range(n))

# Usage
my_function(1000000)
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when `my_function` is decorated with `@timing_decorator`?

A) The original `my_function` is replaced by a new function that includes timing logic but does not modify its behavior.

B) The original `my_function` is preserved, and an additional method is added to the class to handle the timing.

C) The decorator modifies `my_function` in place, changing its functionality to include both calculation and timing without any extra methods.

D) The decorator raises an error because decorators can only be applied to functions, not classes or methods.
