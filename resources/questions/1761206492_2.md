    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a class decorator using metaclasses:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class MyClass:
    pass

print("Class created")
```

What will be the output of this code when executed?

A) Creating class MyClass  
   Class created  

B) Class created  
   Creating class MyClass  

C) AttributeError: 'type' object has no attribute '__new__'  

D) The code will not run due to a syntax error

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Creating class MyClass  
   Class created  

Explanation:
In the given code, `Meta` is a metaclass that prints "Creating class {name}" when a new class is being created. When `MyClass` is decorated with `@Meta`, Python internally creates an instance of `Meta` with the name `'MyClass'` and passes it to `type.__new__`. The order of execution ensures that the print statement in the metaclass `__new__` method executes before the final print statement outside the class definition. Thus, the output will be "Creating class MyClass" followed by "Class created".
