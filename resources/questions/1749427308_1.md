    ## Question
    ### Part 1: Question

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a class with custom behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name in dir(cls):
            if attr_name.startswith("__"):
                continue
            dct[f"_{attr_name}"] = property(lambda self: getattr(self, f"__{attr_name}"))
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.__value = value

obj = MyClass(10)
```

What is the output of `print(obj.value)`?

A) 10  
B) AttributeError  
C) TypeError  
D) None  

### Part 2: Answer

B) AttributeError

Explanation:
The code attempts to create a custom metaclass (`Meta`) that transforms class attributes into properties. The metaclass dynamically renames each attribute by prefixing it with an underscore and creating a property that accesses this new private attribute.

In the `MyClass`, an attribute named `__value` is defined, but due to the metaclass's behavior, there will be no direct access to this attribute from outside the class. Instead, a property named `value` should be created by the metaclass. However, in the provided code, there is no method to handle this transformation correctly.

When you attempt to access `obj.value`, Python looks for an attribute or property with that name on `MyClass`. Since no such property exists due to the incorrect implementation of the metaclass, it raises an `AttributeError`.

The correct behavior would require adding a method in the metaclass to dynamically create and assign properties for each original attribute.
