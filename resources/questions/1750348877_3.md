    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass and class decoration to create a singleton pattern. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of `Singleton` can be created, regardless of how many times it is instantiated.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(SingletonMeta, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

def singleton(cls):
    class Wrapper(cls):
        __metaclass__ = SingletonMeta
    return Wrapper

@singleton
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Example usage
obj1 = MyClass(10)
obj2 = MyClass(20)

print(obj1 is obj2)  # True or False?
```

What will be the output of `print(obj1 is obj2)`?

A) True  
B) False
