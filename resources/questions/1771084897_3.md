    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that attempts to use a metaclass to add a method to a class dynamically:

```python
# Define a metaclass
class AddMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: "Dynamic method called"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Use the metaclass to create a class
class MyClass(metaclass=AddMethodMeta):
    pass

# Create an instance of the class and call the dynamically added method
instance = MyClass()
result = instance.dynamic_method()
print(result)
```

What is the output when you run this code?

A) Dynamic method called  
B) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'dynamic_method'  
C) TypeError: MyMethodMeta.__new__() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given  
D) None
    
    ## Answer
    A) Dynamic method called  

Explanation: The metaclass `AddMethodMeta` correctly adds a new method `dynamic_method` to any class that uses it as its metaclass. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `dynamic_method` is available and can be called without any issues.
