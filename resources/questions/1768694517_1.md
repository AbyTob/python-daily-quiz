    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a metaclass to track all instances of a class:

```python
class InstanceTracker(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        cls._instances[instance] = True
        return instance
    
    @classmethod
    def get_all_instances(cls):
        return list(cls._instances.keys())

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceTracker):
    pass

obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(MyClass.get_all_instances())
```

What will be the output of `MyClass.get_all_instances()`?

A) An empty list  
B) [obj1]  
C) [obj2]  
D) [obj1, obj2]
    
    ## Answer
    A) An empty list  

Explanation: The metaclass `InstanceTracker` is designed to track all instances of the class it decorates. When an instance of `MyClass` is created (`obj1 = MyClass()` and `obj2 = MyClass()`), they are added to the `_instances` dictionary within the metaclass. However, in this specific example, there are no other operations being performed after creating the instances, so no additional logic would be required to track them. Therefore, when `MyClass.get_all_instances()` is called, it returns an empty list because no instances have been added through any method other than direct instantiation.
