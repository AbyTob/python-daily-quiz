    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator for logging method calls with their arguments:

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_method_calls(cls):
    for attr_name, attr_value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith('__'):
            setattr(cls, attr_name, wraps(attr_value)(log_call))
    return cls

def log_call(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_method_calls
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b
```

What potential issues could arise from this implementation of the `log_method_calls` decorator? Which option correctly identifies the main problem?

A) The decorator does not preserve the metadata of the original methods.

B) Calling an instance method will cause infinite recursion due to incorrect method binding.

C) It won't work with class methods or static methods, as they are bound differently.

D) The logging functionality can be disabled by simply removing the `@log_method_calls` decorator from the class definition.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) Calling an instance method will cause infinite recursion due to incorrect method binding.

Explanation: The current implementation of `log_method_calls` uses a loop to modify all callable attributes in the class. However, it does not correctly bind the logged methods back to their instances when called as instance methods. This leads to infinite recursion because each call to an instance method will attempt to log itself again and again, without resolving to the actual method implementation. To fix this, one would need to ensure that the wrapped methods are properly bound to instances using `method.__get__(self, cls)`.
