    ## Question
    [QUESTION] 
Imagine you are developing a web application that needs to handle a large number of simultaneous connections. To optimize performance, you decide to implement an asynchronous I/O framework using Python's `asyncio` library. You want to ensure that each connection is handled by a separate coroutine and that the application can scale efficiently.

Which of the following approaches would be most suitable for handling multiple concurrent connections in your web application?

A) Use traditional synchronous blocking I/O methods.
B) Implement a custom event loop using `asyncio.create_event_loop()`.
C) Create a single asynchronous coroutine to handle all connections.
D) Use threading or multiprocessing to manage separate threads or processes for each connection.
    
    ## Answer
    A) Use traditional synchronous blocking I/O methods.  
This option is not suitable because it would block the entire application when handling any single connection, leading to a lack of scalability.

B) Implement a custom event loop using `asyncio.create_event_loop()`.  
While this could theoretically work, it is unnecessary and redundant since Python's standard library provides a robust event loop implementation with `asyncio`.

C) Create a single asynchronous coroutine to handle all connections.  
This approach would not scale well because a single coroutine can only process one connection at a time, which defeats the purpose of using asynchronous I/O.

D) Use threading or multiprocessing to manage separate threads or processes for each connection.  
This is the most suitable option because it allows multiple coroutines (or threads/processes) to run concurrently, handling different connections at the same time. Each coroutine can use `asyncio`'s mechanisms to perform non-blocking I/O operations efficiently.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Use threading or multiprocessing to manage separate threads or processes for each connection.
