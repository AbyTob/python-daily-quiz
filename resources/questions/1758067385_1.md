    **Part 1: Question**

You are tasked with designing a Python system that manages resources efficiently. You decide to use a metaclass to create a singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of a class can be created across the entire application. Additionally, you want to ensure that the singleton is thread-safe and handles resource initialization lazily.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock: threading.Lock = threading.Lock()

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
                cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Resource(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = None

    def initialize(self, data):
        self.data = data

# Usage example
def main():
    resource1 = Resource()
    resource2 = Resource()

    assert resource1 is resource2  # Both should be the same instance

    resource1.initialize("Data")
    print(resource2.data)  # Should print "Data"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

However, when running this code in a multi-threaded environment, you notice that both `resource1` and `resource2` are not the same instance. Your suspicion is that there might be an issue with how the lock is being used or how instances are being stored.

**Question:**  
Identify the potential issues in the given code snippet and provide a corrected version of the metaclass to ensure thread-safe lazy initialization of the singleton.

A) The lock is not acquired correctly.  
B) Instances are not being stored correctly.  
C) Both A and B  
D) There are no issues with the current implementation.

**Part 2: Answer**

**Answer:** C) Both A and B

Explanation:
The lock is being used correctly, but there might be an issue with how instances are being stored. The `cls._instances` dictionary should be thread-safe itself, so we don't need a separate lock to manage the dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the metaclass:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock: threading.Lock = threading.Lock()

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
                cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Resource(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = None

    def initialize(self, data):
        self.data = data

# Usage example remains the same
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that `_instances` is thread-safe by using a separate lock. However, in practice, it's often better to use `threading.local()` for such cases to avoid global locks altogether:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = threading.local()

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(cls._instances, cls):
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Resource(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = None

    def initialize(self, data):
        self.data = data

# Usage example remains the same
```

This approach avoids the need for explicit locking and is generally more efficient.
