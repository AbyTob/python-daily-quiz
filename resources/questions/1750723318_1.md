    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a metaclass to create a singleton pattern. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of `Singleton` can be created throughout the application.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super(SingletonMeta, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0

s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # True
```

Which of the following statements about the above code is true?

A) The `Singleton` class can be subclassed without any changes.
B) When an instance of `Singleton` is created, its `__init__` method will always be called.
C) The `_instances` dictionary stores instances based on their class names.
D) Subsequent calls to create another `Singleton` object using the same metaclass do not reinitialize the existing instance.
    
    ## Answer
    [C] The `_instances` dictionary stores instances based on their class names.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because subclassing `Singleton` would still utilize the same metaclass, and thus there would still be a singleton constraint.
- Option B is incorrect because the `__init__` method of the `Singleton` class will only be called once when the first instance is created. Subsequent creations through the same metaclass will return the existing instance without reinitializing it.
- Option C is correct; the `_instances` dictionary uses the class (`cls`) as the key, which ensures that each subclass (if any) would have its own separate instance stored in the dictionary.
- Option D is incorrect because when an existing instance of `Singleton` is accessed through the same metaclass, it does not reinitialize the instance; instead, it returns the already created instance.
