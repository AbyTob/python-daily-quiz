    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    @my_decorator
    def my_method(self):
        print(f"Value: {self.value}")

# Usage
obj = MyClass(10)
obj.my_method()
```

What will be the output of this code when `obj.my_method()` is called? Explain your reasoning.

A) 
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Value: 10
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

B) 
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Value: 10
```

C) 
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

D) An error will occur because decorators cannot be applied to class methods.

**Part 2: Answer**

A) 
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Value: 10
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

**Explanation:**  
The decorator `my_decorator` is applied to the method `my_method` of the class `MyClass`. When you call `obj.my_method()`, it first goes through the `wrapper` function defined inside the decorator. The `wrapper` function prints a message before calling the original method `my_method`, then prints another message after the original method has executed. Therefore, the expected output is option A.
