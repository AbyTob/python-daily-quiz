    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet which utilizes a metaclass to dynamically add attributes to a class at creation time:

```python
class DynamicMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for key in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
            dct[key] = 0
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=DynamicMeta):
    pass

# Use MyClass and print its attributes
my_instance = MyClass()
print(my_instance.a)
```

What will be the output of this code when executed?

A) An error because 'a', 'b', and 'c' are not defined in the class body.
B) 0
C) AttributeError: type object 'MyClass' has no attribute 'a'
D) None

[ANSWER]
B) 0

Explanation:
The metaclass `DynamicMeta` is invoked during the creation of `MyClass`. It iterates over a list of strings ['a', 'b', 'c'] and assigns each as an attribute to the class with a value of 0. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it has access to these attributes due to their dynamic addition by the metaclass. Therefore, when we print `my_instance.a`, it correctly outputs `0`.
