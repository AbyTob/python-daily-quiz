    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    async def increment(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        self.count += 1
        print(f"Count is now {self.count}")

async def main():
    counter = AsyncCounter()
    
    tasks = [counter.increment() for _ in range(5)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when you run this code?

A) The count is incremented by 1 every second, and after 5 seconds, the final value of `count` will be 5.

B) The count is incremented by 1 immediately for all tasks, making `count` equal to 5 at the end.

C) The count is never incremented because each call to `increment` is made before the previous one has completed.

D) An error occurs because `asyncio.sleep` cannot be used in a non-async function.

### Part 2 (Answer)

**A)**

The code correctly demonstrates asynchronous execution using asyncio. Each call to `counter.increment()` is awaited, meaning it will pause for 1 second before incrementing the count. After 5 seconds, the final value of `count` will be 5 because each task has its own sleep interval.
