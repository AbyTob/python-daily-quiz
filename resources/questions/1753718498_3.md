    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators to create a singleton pattern:

```python
def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    return get_instance

@singleton
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self, db_name):
        self.db_name = db_name
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `DatabaseConnection` class can have multiple instances because the singleton decorator does not enforce uniqueness.

B) When creating an instance of `DatabaseConnection`, the singleton decorator ensures that only one instance exists for any given class.

C) If you attempt to create two instances of `DatabaseConnection`, they will be created, but subsequent attempts to create another instance with different parameters will reuse the existing instance.

D) The `singleton` function can be used on functions as well as classes, and it will enforce a singleton pattern across all uses.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
B) When creating an instance of `DatabaseConnection`, the singleton decorator ensures that only one instance exists for any given class.

This is because the `singleton` decorator checks if an instance of the decorated class already exists in the `instances` dictionary. If it does, it returns that instance; otherwise, it creates a new instance and stores it in the dictionary. This pattern guarantees that no matter how many times you attempt to create an instance of `DatabaseConnection`, only one instance will be created and reused.
