    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr, value in dct.items():
            if callable(value) and not attr.startswith("__"):
                dct[attr] = timing_decorator(value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Timer(metaclass=TimingMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def add(self, other):
        return self.value + other

    def multiply(self, other):
        return self.value * other
```

When an instance of the `Timer` class is created and its methods are called, which aspects of the code will be affected by both the decorator and metaclass?

A) The creation of the `Timer` class itself will be timed.

B) All callable methods of the `Timer` instances will have their execution time printed.

C) Only the `add` method's execution time will be printed.

D) The `multiply` method's result will be printed instead of its execution time.
    
    ## Answer
    [B] Both A and B are correct.
