    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a decorator which logs function execution times. However, it is not functioning as intended:

```python
import time

def log_execution_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_execution_time
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

When `compute_sum(1000000)` is called, it logs the execution time correctly. However, if you were to call `compute_sum` again without restarting the script, the decorator does not log an additional execution time. Explain why and suggest a modification to the `log_execution_time` decorator so that it can accurately measure and log the execution time for each individual function call.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A correct answer is B: Use a closure or lambda function inside the wrapper that captures the start time and logs it when the function is called again.

Explanation:
The current implementation of `log_execution_time` uses a single start time, which gets captured at the first call. When `compute_sum` is called again, the already captured `start` time does not update, leading to an incorrect execution time calculation for subsequent calls.

A modification could be made to capture the start time inside the wrapper function that gets executed with each call to `compute_sum`, thus ensuring that it logs the correct execution time each time the function is invoked. For example:

```python
def log_execution_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()  # Capture start time here for each call
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_execution_time
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))
```

This modification ensures that the start time is captured anew for each function call, thus providing accurate execution times.
