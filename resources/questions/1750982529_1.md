# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all subclasses:

```python
# Define a metaclass
class AutoAddMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Add a method to all subclasses dynamically
        dct['auto_method'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Base class using the metaclass
class Base(metaclass=AutoAddMethodMeta):
    pass

# Subclasses of Base
class SubClass1(Base):
    pass

class SubClass2(Base):
    pass
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) When an instance of `SubClass1` or `SubClass2` calls `auto_method()`, it will return "Hello from SubClass1" and "Hello from SubClass2" respectively.

B) The method `auto_method()` is added to all subclasses dynamically at runtime using the metaclass.

C) The `AutoAddMethodMeta` metaclass can only be used with classes that inherit directly from `Base`.

D) When an instance of any subclass calls `auto_method()`, it will always return "Hello from Base" because `Base` is the top-level class and defines the method.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
B) The method `auto_method()` is added to all subclasses dynamically at runtime using the metaclass.

Explanation: 
The metaclass `AutoAddMethodMeta` is defined such that it adds a new method `auto_method` to any class that uses this metaclass, including its subclasses. This method returns a string indicating the name of the class where it was called from. Therefore, when an instance of either `SubClass1` or `SubClass2` calls `auto_method()`, it will correctly return "Hello from SubClass1" and "Hello from SubClass2", respectively.

Option A is incorrect because it incorrectly states what the method returns.
Option C is incorrect because there's no restriction on which classes can use this metaclass; any class defined with `metaclass=AutoAddMethodMeta` will have the method added.
Option D is incorrect because each subclass receives its own copy of the method, and it correctly reflects the class name where it was called.
