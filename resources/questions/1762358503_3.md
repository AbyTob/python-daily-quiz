    **Part 1 (Question):**

Implement a decorator that measures the execution time of any function it decorates. The decorator should also log the function name along with its execution time in seconds. Use asyncio for handling asynchronous functions.

```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps
import time

def time_logger(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Example usage:
@time_logger
async def async_task():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)

asyncio.run(async_task())
```

Which of the following is a potential issue with this implementation?

A) The decorator does not handle non-async functions.
B) The decorator correctly logs execution time for both sync and async functions.
C) Using `time.time()` in an async context might give inaccurate results.
D) The decorator can be applied to both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator does not handle non-async functions.

Explanation: The current implementation of the `time_logger` decorator is specifically designed for asynchronous functions using `await`. If a synchronous function is passed to this decorator, it will raise an error because it attempts to use `await` on a non-awaitable value. To make this decorator universal, additional logic would need to be added to differentiate between sync and async functions.
