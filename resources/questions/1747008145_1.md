    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**
Implement a metaclass that allows only one instance of any class it decorates. This metaclass should also ensure that attempting to create another instance results in raising an exception with the message "Only one instance allowed". Use this metaclass on a simple class `Singleton`.

```python
# Your code here

class Singleton:
    pass

# Example usage:
instance1 = Singleton()
print(instance1)  # Should print the singleton instance

try:
    instance2 = Singleton()  # This should raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

**Part 2 (Answer):**
A. 
```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Example usage remains the same
```

B. 
```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instance = None

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instance

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Example usage remains the same
```

C. 
```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        return cls._instance

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Example usage remains the same
```

D. 
```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Example usage remains the same
```

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The correct implementation is option B. This metaclass uses a class variable `_instance` to store the instance of the class when it is first created. Any subsequent attempts to create an instance will return this stored instance, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists.

Option A and D are essentially the same, storing all instances in a dictionary `_instances`, which could lead to issues if multiple different classes use this metaclass. Option C incorrectly tries to modify the class definition during creation using `__new__`, which is not necessary for this functionality.
