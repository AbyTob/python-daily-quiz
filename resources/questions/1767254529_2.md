    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators to enhance a function's behavior:

```python
from functools import wraps

def timing_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def process_data(data):
    # Simulate data processing with a sleep
    time.sleep(1)
    return [x * 2 for x in data]

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = process_data(data)
print(result)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `timing_decorator` will not execute if an exception occurs within the `process_data` function.

B) The `wrapper` function inside `timing_decorator` can access all non-global variables defined in `process_data`.

C) The `func.__name__` in the `wrapper` function refers to the name of the original `process_data` function.

D) The use of `@wraps(func)` is not necessary and can be omitted without affecting the functionality of the decorator.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The `func.__name__` in the `wrapper` function refers to the name of the original `process_data` function.

Explanation: The `@wraps(func)` decorator preserves the metadata of the original function, such as its name. This means that within the `wrapper` function, `func.__name__` correctly refers to the name of the original function `process_data`. If `@wraps(func)` were omitted, calling `func.__name__` inside the `wrapper` would return `'wrapper'`, which is the name of the inner function.
