    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a class-level decorator. The decorator is intended to modify the behavior of any method defined within the decorated class by prepending a print statement indicating the start of the method execution.

```python
from typing import Callable, Any

class MethodLogger(type):
    def __new__(cls, name: str, bases: tuple, dct: dict) -> Any:
        for key, value in dct.items():
            if callable(value):
                dct[key] = cls._log_method(value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def _log_method(method: Callable) -> Callable:
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Executing {method.__name__}...")
            return method(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

class Calculator(metaclass=MethodLogger):
    def add(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        return a + b
```

When an instance of `Calculator` is created and the `add` method is called, the output will be:

```
Executing add...
5
```

Which of the following statements about this code snippet is true?

A) The metaclass `MethodLogger` correctly applies the decorator to all methods in the class `Calculator`.

B) The decorator defined within the metaclass is not correctly implemented and will not work as expected.

C) The metaclass `MethodLogger` should be applied at runtime using a class decorator instead of being used during class creation.

D) The method `add` will not execute because of an error in the implementation of the metaclass or the decorator.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The decorator defined within the metaclass is not correctly implemented and will not work as expected.

Explanation:
The issue with this code lies in how the methods are being replaced within the class dictionary. When a callable (method) is found, it is wrapped with the `_log_method` function. However, if the method has any attributes (like `__name__`, `__annotations__`, etc.), these will not be preserved in the wrapper function. As a result, when the method is called, Python's built-in methods like `__getattribute__` might not behave as expected due to the absence of these attributes in the wrapper function.

This example demonstrates why it's crucial to handle such details correctly when using metaclasses or class decorators to modify method behavior at the class level.
