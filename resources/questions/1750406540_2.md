    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators, metaclasses, and coroutines. The goal is to create a class `AsyncMeta` that can be used as a metaclass for asynchronous classes. When an instance of such a class is created, it should automatically run a coroutine method named `_run`.

```python
import asyncio

def async_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return asyncio.create_task(func(*args, **kwargs))
    return wrapper

class AsyncMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name in dir(cls):
            attr = getattr(cls, attr_name)
            if callable(attr) and hasattr(attr, '_run'):
                dct[attr_name] = async_decorator(attr)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AsyncClass(metaclass=AsyncMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = [1, 2, 3]

    @async_decorator
    async def _run(self):
        print("Running _run coroutine")
        for item in self.data:
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
            print(item)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    instance = AsyncClass()
    asyncio.run(instance._run())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `AsyncMeta` metaclass will not modify any methods in the subclass `AsyncClass`.

B) When an instance of `AsyncClass` is created, `_run` will be run immediately and print all items from `self.data`.

C) The `async_decorator` is applied to `_run`, but it won't affect its behavior because `_run` already has the `_run` attribute.

D) An instance of `AsyncClass` can be created without any errors, and when `_run` is called on that instance, it will execute asynchronously.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

D) An instance of `AsyncClass` can be created without any errors, and when `_run` is called on that instance, it will execute asynchronously.

Explanation: 
- The `AsyncMeta` metaclass dynamically decorates all methods in the subclass with `async_decorator`, but since `_run` already has a method named `_run`, it does not get affected by the decorator.
- When an instance of `AsyncClass` is created, the `_run` coroutine is decorated and can be called asynchronously using `await`.
- The code will run without errors, and when you call `_run()` on the instance within the `asyncio.run(instance._run())`, it will execute in a separate task, demonstrating asynchronous behavior.
