    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code snippet that uses Python's asyncio library for asynchronous programming. The goal is to create a function `fetch_data` that fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently and returns the results in order of completion.

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    # Simulate an async network request with an artificial delay
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def main():
    urls = ["http://example.com", "http://example.org", "http://example.net"]
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is **not** true about this code?

A. The `fetch_data` function simulates an async network request by sleeping for 2 seconds.

B. The `main` function creates a list of tasks for each URL and uses `asyncio.gather` to execute them concurrently.

C. The `return_exceptions=True` argument in `asyncio.gather` ensures that exceptions are caught and handled gracefully, allowing the program to continue running even if some requests fail.

D. If one of the fetch operations raises an exception, the other operations will not be interrupted and will still complete.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is **D**. 

Explanation: In Python's asyncio library, when `asyncio.gather` is called with `return_exceptions=True`, it ensures that exceptions raised by any of the tasks are captured and returned in the results list as exceptions rather than raising them immediately. This allows the program to continue executing subsequent tasks even if some have failed. Therefore, statement D is not true because one failing task does not interrupt other ongoing tasks; they will complete as usual before the `asyncio.gather` call completes its execution.
