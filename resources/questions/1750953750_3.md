    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a combination of metaclasses and decorators:

```python
def log_method_calls(cls):
    class WrappedClass:
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.instance = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        
        def __getattr__(self, name):
            attribute = getattr(self.instance, name)
            if callable(attribute):
                return lambda *args, **kwargs: (print(f"Calling {name} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}"), attribute(*args, **kwargs))
            return attribute
    return WrappedClass

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        new_class = super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                setattr(new_class, attr_name, log_method_calls(attr_value))
        return new_class

class Calculator(metaclass=Meta):
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
    
    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `log_method_calls` decorator only logs calls to methods in `Calculator`, but not in any subclass.
B) The `Meta` metaclass dynamically adds logging capabilities to all methods defined in any class that uses it as its metaclass.
C) When an instance of `Calculator` is created, `__init__` is called on the wrapped version of `Calculator`.
D) Calling `add(2, 3)` on an instance of `Calculator` will print "Calling add with args: (2, 3), kwargs: {}" and then return 5.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `Meta` metaclass dynamically adds logging capabilities to all methods defined in any class that uses it as its metaclass.

Explanation:
- The `log_method_calls` decorator wraps callable attributes of a class to add logging functionality. However, it is applied within the `Meta` metaclass.
- The `Meta` metaclass iterates over the attributes of the class being created and applies the `log_method_calls` decorator to any callable methods found.
- This means that all methods in classes defined with `Meta` as their metaclass will have logging capabilities added, not just those explicitly in `Calculator`.
- When an instance of a class using `Meta` is created, the `__init__` method of the metaclass's generated class is called. However, it does not modify the `__init__` method itself; it wraps any callable attributes to add logging.
- Calling `add(2, 3)` on an instance of `Calculator` will indeed print "Calling add with args: (2, 3), kwargs: {}" and then return 5, demonstrating that the decorator has been applied.
