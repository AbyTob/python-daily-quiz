# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses decorators and metaclasses:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def my_method(cls):
        return "Hello"

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Decorator called")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@decorator
class AnotherClass:
    pass

instance = AnotherClass()
print(MyClass.my_method())
```

What will be the output of this code when executed?

A) "Decorator called\nCreating class MyClass\nHello"

B) "Decorator called\nCreating class MyClass\nNone"

C) "Creating class MyClass\nDecorator called\nHello"

D) "Creating class MyClass\nDecorator called\nNone"
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

A) "Decorator called\nCreating class MyClass\nHello"

Explanation:

1. When `MyClass` is defined, the metaclass `Meta` intercepts its creation and prints "Creating class MyClass".
2. The method `my_method` is decorated with a simple decorator that also prints "Decorator called" when the method is accessed.
3. When `AnotherClass` is instantiated, it triggers the `decorator`, which in turn calls `wrapper`. However, since no actual functionality is provided inside `wrapper`, the output remains unchanged from the class creation phase.
4. Finally, calling `MyClass.my_method()` executes the decorated method, resulting in "Decorator called" being printed followed by "Hello".
