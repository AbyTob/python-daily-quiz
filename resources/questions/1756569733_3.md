# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator and a metaclass:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Base(metaclass=Meta):
    @abstractmethod
    def method(self):
        pass

def decorator(cls):
    class WrappedClass(cls):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            print("Decorator initialized")
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    return WrappedClass

@decorator
class Derived(Base):
    def method(self):
        print("Method called")

# Usage
obj = Derived()
obj.method()
```

1. What is printed when the code is executed?
2. Why does using a metaclass and a decorator in this way affect the class creation process?
3. How does the `WrappedClass` created by the decorator interact with the `Derived` class?

Select all correct options:
A) "Creating class Derived"
B) "Decorator initialized"
C) "Method called"
D) The `WrappedClass` inherits from `Base`
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer:** B, C

**Explanation:**

1. When the code is executed, the following will be printed:
   - "Creating class Derived" because of the metaclass `Meta`.
   - "Decorator initialized" because of the decorator `decorator`.
   - "Method called" because `obj.method()` is called on an instance of `Derived`.

2. Using a metaclass and a decorator in this way affects the class creation process by:
   - Changing how the class is created and initialized, as shown by the output.
   - Demonstrating that decorators can be used to modify or extend classes dynamically.

3. The `WrappedClass` created by the decorator interacts with the `Derived` class as follows:
   - `WrappedClass` inherits from `Base`, so it must provide an implementation for the abstract method `method`.
   - When an instance of `Derived` is created, it actually creates an instance of `WrappedClass` because of the decorator.
   - This means that when `obj.method()` is called, it calls the overridden method in `WrappedClass`.

Option A and D are incorrect as they do not match the output or interaction described.
