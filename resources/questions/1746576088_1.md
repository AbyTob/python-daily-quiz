    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Data fetched"

async def process_data(data):
    print(f"Processing {data}...")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"{data} processed"

async def main():
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    task = loop.create_task(fetch_data())
    data = await task
    result = await process_data(data)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `fetch_data` and `process_data` functions are synchronous.
B) Both `fetch_data` and `process_data` use explicit coroutine syntax with `async def`.
C) The `main` function uses a custom event loop to manage tasks, but it does not need to be created explicitly since `asyncio.run()` takes care of that.
D) Using `await asyncio.sleep(n)` is more efficient than using `time.sleep(n)` for simulating delays in asynchronous code.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The `main` function uses a custom event loop to manage tasks, but it does not need to be created explicitly since `asyncio.run()` takes care of that.
