    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

**Question:** Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a class decorator which measures and prints the execution time of any method in the decorated class. The goal is to enhance each method's functionality without modifying its implementation.

```python
import time

def measure_time(cls):
    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(value):
            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))
    return cls

def _time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@measure_time
class ExampleClass:
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(1)
```

**Question:** What is the issue with this implementation of the `measure_time` decorator, and how might you fix it to ensure that the original method behavior remains intact?

A) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.

B) The decorator modifies the class in-place which could cause issues if multiple instances are created.

C) The `wrapper` function is not capturing the correct reference of the original method.

D) The `measure_time` decorator should be a metaclass instead of a class decorator to avoid modifying the class directly.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer:** A) The decorator does not handle instance methods correctly.

**Explanation:** The current implementation assumes that all attributes in the class dictionary are callable methods, but it fails to distinguish between static methods and instance methods. When a method is called on an instance, Python first checks if it exists in the instance's `__dict__`, then in its class. Since the decorator replaces all callables with wrappers, it mistakenly tries to wrap static methods as well, leading to errors.

To fix this, you need to ensure that only instance methods are wrapped. Here is a corrected version of the `measure_time` decorator:

```python
import time

def measure_time(cls):
    for name, value in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(value) and not isinstance(value, staticmethod):
            setattr(cls, name, _time_decorator(value))
    return cls

def _time_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@measure_time
class ExampleClass:
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    @staticmethod
    def method2():
        time.sleep(1)
```

In this corrected version, the decorator checks if the callable is not a staticmethod using `isinstance(value, staticmethod)` before wrapping it, ensuring that only instance methods are modified.
