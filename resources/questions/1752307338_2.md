# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question): 
Consider the following code snippet that aims to create a decorator which measures the execution time of a function. However, there is an issue with the implementation. Identify the problem and correct it.

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

# Expected output:
# compute_sum(1000000) took 0.0023456789012345678 seconds to execute.
# Actual output (varies depending on the system): 
# compute_sum(1000000) took -1.0 seconds to execute.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A: The issue is that `time.time()` returns a floating-point number of seconds since the epoch, not an integer. Printing `-1.0` seconds to execute suggests an error in capturing the end time correctly.

Correct answer: B

Explanation:
The problem lies in how the timing is calculated. When calculating the duration, it's crucial to subtract the start time from the end time accurately. The code currently calculates `end_time - start_time` but does not ensure that both times are correctly captured. In some cases, especially under heavy load or on slower systems, this might lead to negative durations which don't make sense in a real-world scenario.

To fix the issue, we should ensure that the timing calculation is done correctly. Here's how you can correct it:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()  # Capture the start time before calling the function
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()  # Capture the end time after the function has executed
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

# Expected output:
# compute_sum(1000000) took 0.0023456789012345678 seconds to execute.
```

This corrected version ensures that the timing is calculated accurately, avoiding negative durations and providing meaningful execution time information.
