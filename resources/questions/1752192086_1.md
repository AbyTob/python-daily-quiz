**Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

def async_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@async_decorator
async def my_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Hello, world!"

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(my_async_function())
print(result)
```

What will be the output of this code when executed?

A) "Hello, world!"  
B) An error indicating that `my_async_function` is not an async function  
C) A hang because `asyncio.sleep(2)` blocks the event loop  
D) None

**Part 2: Answer**

B) An error indicating that `my_async_function` is not an async function  

Explanation: The decorator `async_decorator` wraps the `my_async_function` but does not preserve its asynchronous nature. By using the decorator, you lose the ability to use `await` within the function, which makes it no longer an asynchronous function. When attempting to run this function with `loop.run_until_complete()`, Python will raise a `TypeError` stating that the object is not callable as an async function.
