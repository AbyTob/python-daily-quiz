    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to add an attribute dynamically to any class instantiated from it:

```python
class DynamicAttributeMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_attribute'] = 'This is dynamic'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=DynamicAttributeMeta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.dynamic_attribute)
```

What will be the output of this code?

A) This is dynamic
B) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'dynamic_attribute'
C) TypeError: metaclass conflict
D) SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    
    ## Answer
    A) This is dynamic

The correct answer is A) This is dynamic. The metaclass `DynamicAttributeMeta` modifies the dictionary of any class it decorates by adding a new key-value pair, where 'dynamic_attribute' is the key and 'This is dynamic' is its value. When an instance of `MyClass` is created, this new attribute becomes part of the instance's attributes, allowing access to 'dynamic_attribute'.
