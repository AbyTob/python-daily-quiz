    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to enforce type checking on class attributes:

```python
class TypeEnforcer(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr, value in dct.items():
            if not isinstance(value, int):
                raise TypeError(f"{attr} must be an integer")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class DataClass(metaclass=TypeEnforcer):
    a = 1
    b = "string"  # This will cause an error when the class is defined

# Uncommenting the following line will raise an error
# data = DataClass()
```

What happens if you uncomment the `data = DataClass()` line, and why?

A) The code will run without errors.

B) A `TypeError` will be raised because "b" is not an integer.

C) The class definition will fail to complete due to a syntax error.

D) An infinite recursion error will occur.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) A `TypeError` will be raised because "b" is not an integer.

Explanation: When the `DataClass` is being defined, the metaclass `TypeEnforcer` checks each attribute of the class. It encounters that `b` has a value of `"string"` which is not an integer, thus it raises a `TypeError`. This error occurs before any instance of `DataClass` can be created, making options A and C incorrect. Infinite recursion is not possible in this context due to the metaclass enforcement happening during class creation rather than during runtime.
