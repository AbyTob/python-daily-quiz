# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class. However, it doesn't fully prevent multiple instances from being created when used in certain ways. Your task is to modify the metaclass or add another mechanism to ensure true singularity.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Example usage
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # Should ideally print True but might not due to certain issues with metaclasses
```

What could be improved in the `SingletonMeta` class or an additional approach that would ensure true singularity of the `Singleton` class?

A) Ensure that `__new__` is overridden instead of `__call__`.

B) Use a lock to synchronize access to `_instances` dictionary.

C) Store instances in a global dictionary outside the metaclass.

D) Implement `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__` methods to prevent copying of singleton instances.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
B) Use a lock to synchronize access to `_instances` dictionary.

Explanation:
The current implementation of the `SingletonMeta` class uses `__call__`, which can lead to race conditions when multiple threads try to create an instance simultaneously. By using a lock, we ensure that only one thread can execute the creation logic at a time, thus preventing the creation of multiple instances even in multi-threaded environments.

Here's how you could modify the code:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock = threading.Lock()

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
                cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # This will correctly print True
```

Option A is incorrect because `__new__` should not be used in this context as it bypasses the `__call__` mechanism which is crucial for metaclass-based singletons.

Option C is generally considered bad practice and can lead to memory leaks or other issues.

Option D is not relevant to ensuring singularity of a class; it's more about object copying, which doesn't affect the singleton pattern directly.
