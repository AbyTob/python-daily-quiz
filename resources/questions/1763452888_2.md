    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a custom decorator for a class method:

```python
def log_method_calls(cls):
    for name, member in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(member) and not name.startswith('__'):
            setattr(cls, name, log_call(member))
    return cls

def log_call(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_method_calls
class Calculator:
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y
    
    def subtract(self, x, y):
        return x - y
```

What is the expected output when creating an instance of `Calculator` and calling its methods?

A) An error because decorators cannot be applied to class methods  
B) Logs method calls and returns the result for each method call  
C) Only logs the first method called  
D) Does not log anything and returns the result directly
    
    ## Answer
    B) Logs method calls and returns the result for each method call
