    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a custom metaclass which dynamically adds methods to classes:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.greet())
```

However, this code does not work as expected. What is the issue with the `Meta` metaclass, and how can you fix it to ensure that the `greet` method is correctly added to all classes using this metaclass?

A) The `__new__` method should be defined as a static method.

B) The `greet` method should not be a lambda function; it should be defined normally inside the metaclass.

C) The `super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)` call is unnecessary and can be removed.

D) The metaclass implementation is correct, but the class definition needs to specify an explicit superclass (`object`).

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The `greet` method should not be a lambda function; it should be defined normally inside the metaclass.

Explanation: In Python, methods added to classes using metaclasses must be defined as regular functions within the metaclass. Using a lambda function here prevents proper binding of the method to instances of the class, leading to a runtime error when `obj.greet()` is called. To fix this issue, you should define the `greet` method with a normal def statement inside the `Meta` metaclass:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        def greet(self):
            return f"Hello from {name}"
        dct['greet'] = greet
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.greet())  # Output: Hello from MyClass
```

This corrected version ensures that the `greet` method is properly added to instances of classes defined with this metaclass.
