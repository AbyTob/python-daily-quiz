    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that aims to create a decorator to measure execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

# Call the decorated function
print(compute_sum(1000000))
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `timer` decorator will correctly measure and print the time taken to execute the `compute_sum` function.

B) The `wrapper` function inside the `timer` decorator does not capture any local variables from the `compute_sum` function, so its closure over these variables won't work properly.

C) Using a metaclass instead of a decorator for measuring execution time would have no impact on performance and readability.

D) The `compute_sum` function will not be able to run because the `timer` decorator is incorrectly implemented.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `timer` decorator will correctly measure and print the time taken to execute the `compute_sum` function.

Explanation: In Python, decorators work by wrapping a function inside another function. In this case, the `timer` decorator correctly wraps the `compute_sum` function. When `compute_sum(1000000)` is called, it will measure and print the time taken to execute the function. The `wrapper` function captures the local variables from the scope of `compute_sum`, so its closure over these variables works properly.
