    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, seconds):
        self.seconds = seconds

    async def start(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(self.seconds)
        return f"Timer finished after {self.seconds} seconds"

async def main():
    timers = [AsyncTimer(i) for i in range(1, 4)]
    tasks = [timer.start() for timer in timers]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior and output of this code?

A) The timers will run concurrently, printing all their completion messages at once.

B) The timers will run sequentially, waiting for each timer to complete before starting the next.

C) The code will raise an error because it attempts to start coroutines directly without using `await`.

D) The timers will run in parallel, but only one will be able to print its message at a time due to event loop limitations.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The timers will run concurrently, printing all their completion messages at once.

Explanation: In Python's asyncio, when you create and start multiple coroutines without using `await`, they are scheduled to run concurrently. The `asyncio.gather` function is used to wait for all the tasks to complete before exiting, but it doesn't guarantee any specific order of execution or blocking behavior. Each timer runs independently in its own task, and their completion messages will be printed as soon as each one finishes, potentially overlapping if they finish close together.
