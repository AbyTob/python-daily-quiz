    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method `log_access` to any class it decorates. The purpose of this method is to log every access to any instance attribute of the class.

```python
class AccessLoggerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name in dct:
            if isinstance(dct[attr_name], property):
                dct[f"_{attr_name}_get"] = dct[attr_name].fget
                dct[f"_{attr_name}_set"] = dct[attr_name].fset
                dct[attr_name] = property(
                    lambda self, name=attr_name: cls.log_access(self, name),
                    lambda self, value, name=attr_name: setattr(self, f"_{name}", value)
                )
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def log_access(instance, attr):
        print(f"Accessing {attr}")
        return getattr(instance, f"_{attr}")

class User(metaclass=AccessLoggerMeta):
    def __init__(self, username, email):
        self.username = username
        self.email = email

user = User("john_doe", "john@example.com")
print(user.username)  # Accessing username
```

Which of the following statements about the code above is true?

A. The `log_access` method will not log any access to attributes because it uses a lambda function incorrectly.

B. When you create an instance of `User`, accessing `user.username` will print "Accessing username" and then return the value of `username`.

C. Using metaclasses in this way is considered bad practice because it makes the code harder to read and maintain.

D. The code will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to access an attribute because the `log_access` method does not handle setting the attribute correctly.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B. When you create an instance of `User`, accessing `user.username` will print "Accessing username" and then return the value of `username`.

Explanation:
The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` dynamically wraps each property in a class with getter and setter methods that call `log_access`. This method logs access to attributes. In the given example, when you create an instance of `User` and try to access the `username` attribute, it will first log "Accessing username" and then return the value of the actual `username` attribute (which is stored in a private variable `_username`).
