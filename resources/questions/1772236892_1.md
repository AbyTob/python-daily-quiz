    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to add a class attribute dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_attr'] = 'I am dynamic'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
```

What will be the output of `print(obj.dynamic_attr)`?

A) AttributeError  
B) 'I am dynamic'  
C) None  
D) TypeError

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**B) 'I am dynamic'**

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` is defined to dynamically add a class attribute `dynamic_attr` with the value `'I am dynamic'`.
- When `MyClass` is defined using this metaclass, the metaclass's `__new__` method is invoked during the creation of `MyClass`. It adds the attribute `dynamic_attr` to the dictionary that will become the class `MyClass`.
- As a result, when an instance of `MyClass` (e.g., `obj`) is created and we try to access its `dynamic_attr`, it correctly prints `'I am dynamic'`.

This question tests your understanding of how metaclasses can be used to modify or enhance classes dynamically during their creation.
