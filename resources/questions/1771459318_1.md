    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Before function call")
        result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After function call")
        return result

@AsyncDecorator
async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data fetched"

async def main():
    data = await fetch_data()
    print(data)

# Running the main function in an event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code? 

A) The `fetch_data` function is called immediately when the script runs.

B) The `AsyncDecorator` class is not used correctly, as it should be a regular decorator to work with async functions.

C) The `main` function is an async function that will wait for 1 second before printing "Data fetched".

D) The `fetch_data` function is decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`, but the actual execution of the decorated function is not shown in the provided code.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] C) The `main` function is an async function that will wait for 1 second before printing "Data fetched".

**Explanation**: In the provided code, `fetch_data` is correctly decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`. When `asyncio.run(main())` is called, it triggers the execution of the `main` coroutine. Inside `main`, it awaits the result of `await fetch_data()`. The `fetch_data` function, when awaited, will indeed wait for 1 second due to `await asyncio.sleep(1)`, and then print "Data fetched".
