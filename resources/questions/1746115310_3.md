    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def task1():
    print("Task 1 started")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Task 1 finished")

async def task2():
    print("Task 2 started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Task 2 finished")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2())
    print("All tasks completed")

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the output of this script?

A) The output will be "Task 1 started", followed by "Task 2 started", then "Task 1 finished", and finally "Task 2 finished".

B) The output will be "Task 1 started", then "Task 2 started", followed by "Task 1 finished" after a delay of 1 second, and finally "Task 2 finished".

C) The output will be "Task 1 started", followed by "Task 2 started", and both tasks will finish concurrently without waiting for the other.

D) The output will be "Task 1 started", then "Task 2 started", followed by "Task 2 finished" after a delay of 1 second, but "Task 1 finished" will not print because it takes longer to complete.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The output will be "Task 1 started", then "Task 2 started", followed by "Task 1 finished" after a delay of 1 second, and finally "Task 2 finished".

Explanation: 
- The `asyncio.gather` function runs multiple coroutines concurrently.
- When both tasks start, they print their start messages immediately.
- However, since `task2` completes first (after 1 second), its completion is printed next.
- After a total of 2 seconds, the completion of `task1` is printed.
