    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question):

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval
    
    def __call__(self, func):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
            return await func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

@AsyncTimer(2)
async def my_task():
    print("Task is running...")

# Run the task
asyncio.run(my_task())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior and implementation of `AsyncTimer` as a decorator in this context?

A) `AsyncTimer` is a metaclass that modifies the class definition to add asynchronous functionality.

B) `AsyncTimer` is a function that returns another function which, when called, will wait for the specified interval before executing the original function.

C) `AsyncTimer` is a generator that yields execution after the specified interval.

D) `AsyncTimer` is a context manager that ensures resources are released after a task runs.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer):

B) `AsyncTimer` is a function that returns another function which, when called, will wait for the specified interval before executing the original function.

**Explanation**: 
The `AsyncTimer` class is defined with an initializer to set the interval. The class also defines a `__call__` method, making it callable as a decorator. When `@AsyncTimer(2)` decorates `my_task`, the `wrapper` function returned by `__call__` is assigned to `my_task`. When `my_task()` is called, it first waits for 2 seconds (as specified by `AsyncTimer(2)`) using `await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)` and then proceeds to execute the original task. This demonstrates how decorators can be used to enhance or modify the behavior of functions asynchronously in Python.
