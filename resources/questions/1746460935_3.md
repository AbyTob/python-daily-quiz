    **Part 1 (Question):**
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior. The goal is to create a metaclass `LogMethodCalls` that logs every method call with its arguments.

```python
class LogMethodCalls(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = cls.wrap_method(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def wrap_method(method):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Method '{method.__name__}' called with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
            return method(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

class MyClass(metaclass=LogMethodCalls):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def add(self, a, b):
        return self.x + self.y + a + b

# Example usage:
obj = MyClass(10, 20)
print(obj.add(5, 3))
```

What will be the output of the code when `MyClass` is instantiated and its method `add` is called?

A) Method 'add' called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}  
   40

B) Method '__init__' called with args: (), kwargs: {}  
   38

C) Method '__init__' called with args: (10, 20), kwargs: {}  
   Method 'add' called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}  
   40

D) Error: __new__() got multiple values for argument 'name'

**Part 2 (Answer):**
C) Method '__init__' called with args: (10, 20), kwargs: {}  
   Method 'add' called with args: (5,), kwargs: {}  
   40

**Explanation:** 
When `MyClass` is instantiated, the metaclass `LogMethodCalls` logs the call to the `__init__` method before executing it. After `__init__` is called, when `obj.add(5, 3)` is executed, the `add` method is also logged by the `LogMethodCalls` metaclass. The expected output includes both the log statements and the result of the `add` method call, which is 40.
