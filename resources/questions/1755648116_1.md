    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a Singleton pattern. The goal is to ensure that only one instance of a class can be created, even when multiple instances are attempted.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = None

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s1 = Singleton()
    s2 = Singleton()

    assert s1 is s2, "Singletons are not the same instance"
    print(s1.value)
    s1.value = 42
    print(s2.value)  # This should also be 42
```

Which of the following statements about the provided code is true?

A) The `Singleton` class can have multiple instances depending on how it is instantiated.
B) The `_instances` dictionary in the metaclass is used to store all instances created by subclasses of `Singleton`.
C) When a subclass of `Singleton` is instantiated, its constructor is called even if an instance already exists.
D) The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that no matter how many times `Singleton()` is called, only one instance is returned.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
D

The `SingletonMeta` metaclass uses a dictionary `_instances` to store instances of the class. When `__call__` is invoked (which happens whenever an instance of a class is created), it checks if an instance already exists in `_instances`. If not, it creates a new one and stores it. Subsequent calls return the stored instance. Therefore, regardless of how many times `Singleton()` is called, only one instance is returned, ensuring the Singleton pattern is adhered to.
