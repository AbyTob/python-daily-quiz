    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a class decorator. The goal is to add a method `log_access` to any class decorated with this metaclass, which logs every attribute access.

```python
import types

class AccessLoggerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        original_getattribute = dct.get("__getattribute__")

        def new_getattribute(self, attr_name):
            print(f"Accessing {attr_name}")
            if original_getattribute:
                return original_getattribute(self, attr_name)
            else:
                return super().__getattribute__(attr_name)

        dct["__getattribute__"] = types.MethodType(new_getattribute, None, cls)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AccessLoggerMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Example usage
obj = MyClass(10)
print(obj.value)  # Should log "Accessing value" and print 10
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` correctly logs all attribute accesses on instances of `MyClass`.
B) The method `log_access` is added to `MyClass` via the metaclass.
C) The original `__getattribute__` method is preserved and called when accessing attributes.
D) The class `MyClass` cannot be instantiated because of a missing constructor.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

C) The original `__getattribute__` method is preserved and called when accessing attributes.

Explanation:
The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` correctly modifies the `__getattribute__` method of any class it decorates. It wraps the original `__getattribute__` with a new function that logs access to attributes before delegating to the original method. This ensures that all attribute accesses are logged, and the original behavior is preserved.

Option A is incorrect because no logging occurs on attribute access directly; only method calls log access.
Option B is incorrect because no `log_access` method is added; instead, `__getattribute__` is modified.
Option D is incorrect because there is no issue with instantiating `MyClass`; it can be instantiated normally.
