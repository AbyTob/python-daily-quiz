    ## Answer
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet which uses a metaclass to enhance class behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'log' not in dct:
            dct['log'] = lambda self: f"{self} is logging"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class ChildClass(BaseClass):
    def log(self):
        return "Custom log message"

def get_log(obj):
    return obj.log()

# Example usage
child = ChildClass()
print(get_log(child))
```

What will be the output of `get_log(child)` when executed?

A) `<__main__.ChildClass object at 0x...> is logging`
B) `Custom log message`
C) An error, as 'log' method in BaseClass cannot be overridden
D) None

Part 2 (Answer):
B) `Custom log message`

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` defines a new class attribute `log` if it doesn't already exist. This attribute is set to a lambda function that returns a default logging string.
- When `ChildClass` is defined, the metaclass `Meta` checks if 'log' is in the dictionary of `ChildClass`. Since `ChildClass` explicitly defines its own `log` method, it overrides the one added by the metaclass.
- Therefore, when `get_log(child)` is called, it calls the overridden `log` method from `ChildClass`, which returns "Custom log message".
