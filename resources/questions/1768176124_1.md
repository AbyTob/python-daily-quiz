    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return asyncio.run(self.func(*args, **kwargs))

@AsyncDecorator
async def async_task():
    print("Task started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Task completed")

def main():
    result = async_task()
    print(f"Result: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

What will be the output of this script when run? Explain your reasoning.

A) Task started  
B) Task completed  
C) Result: None  
D) Task started  
   Result: Task completed

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**Correct answer: D)

Explanation:** The correct output of the script is:

```
Task started
Result: Task completed
```

This result is achieved as follows:
- The `AsyncDecorator` class is defined to take a function and make it asynchronous by wrapping its call with `asyncio.run()`.
- The `async_task` function is decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`, which means that when `async_task()` is called, it will execute asynchronously using `asyncio.run()`.
- Inside the `main` function, `async_task()` is invoked. Since `async_task` has been decorated with `@AsyncDecorator`, `asyncio.run(async_task())` is executed.
- The `async_task` coroutine prints "Task started", waits for 1 second with `await asyncio.sleep(1)`, and then prints "Task completed".
- As a result, the script outputs both messages in order, followed by "Result: Task completed".
