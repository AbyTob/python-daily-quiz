# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator along with a metaclass:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'method' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Class must implement method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def class_decorator(cls):
    original_method = cls.method

    def new_method(self):
        print("Decorated!")
        return original_method(self)
    
    cls.method = new_method
    return cls

@Meta
@class_decorator
class MyClass:
    def method(self):
        return "Original method"

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.method())
```

What will be the output when `MyClass().method()` is called?

A) TypeError: Class must implement method  
B) Original method  
C) Decorated! Original method  
D) Decorated!
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):

**Answer:** C) Decorated! Original method

**Explanation:** The code defines a metaclass `Meta` that checks if the class it's applied to has a method named `method`. If not, it raises a TypeError. The decorator `class_decorator` wraps the original method with an additional print statement. When we instantiate `MyClass()`, the metaclass ensures that `MyClass` implements `method`, and then the decorator modifies this method to include a decoration message before calling the original method. Therefore, when `obj.method()` is called, it outputs "Decorated!" followed by the output of the original method, which is "Original method".
