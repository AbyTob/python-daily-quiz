# Python Quiz Question

## Question
Part 1 (Question): 
Imagine you are developing a web application where users can upload files. You want to ensure that only specific types of files (e.g., .txt, .pdf) can be uploaded. To achieve this, you decide to use decorators and metaclasses in Python.

You create a decorator `@allowed_file_types` that checks if the file type is allowed. Then, you define a metaclass `FileTypeMeta` that automatically applies the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to any class derived from it, setting the allowed types as a parameter.

Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```python
def allowed_file_types(*types):
    def wrapper(cls):
        cls.allowed_types = types
        return cls
    return wrapper

class FileTypeMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'allowed_types' not in dct:
            dct['allowed_types'] = ()
        super_new = super(FileTypeMeta, cls).__new__
        return super_new(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AllowedFiles(metaclass=FileTypeMeta):
    pass

class TextFile(AllowedFiles):
    # TODO: Apply the allowed_file_types decorator here
    pass

# Example usage:
txt_file = TextFile()
print(txt_file.allowed_types)  # Should print ('.txt',)
```

Which of the following ways can you correctly apply the `@allowed_file_types` decorator to the `TextFile` class using the metaclass?

A) Use a direct assignment in the class definition.
B) Override the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute.
C) Use a class variable directly within the class definition.
D) Call the `@allowed_file_types` decorator directly on the class.

## Answer
Part 2 (Answer): 
A) Direct assignment is not an option because decorators are applied before the class is fully defined, and direct assignment would occur after the class is created.

B) Correct. By overriding the `__new__` method in the metaclass to add the attribute, you can ensure that any subclass of `AllowedFiles` will have its `allowed_types` attribute set by default if not explicitly provided.

C) This would work but doesn't utilize the decorator mechanism and isn't as clean or flexible as using a metaclass.

D) Calling the decorator directly on the class is also not correct because it bypasses the metaclass's influence, which should be used to set the `allowed_types` attribute.
