    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_task(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(f"Task {n}: Step {i}")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return n

async def main():
    tasks = [async_task(i) for i in range(3)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print("All tasks completed:", results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the execution of this code?

A) The output will be completely non-deterministic because of the `await asyncio.sleep(1)` calls.

B) All tasks start immediately, and they will complete in the order they were started (0, 1, then 2).

C) The `asyncio.gather` function waits for all tasks to finish before printing "All tasks completed:", but it does not guarantee that tasks are run concurrently.

D) The output will be completely deterministic because each task prints its steps sequentially without overlapping.
