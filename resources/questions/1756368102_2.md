# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):  
Consider the following Python code that uses decorators and metaclasses:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f"Hello, I am a {name}!"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
class Person:
    pass

def greet_decorator(cls):
    original_greet = cls.greet
    def new_greet(self):
        return original_greet(self).upper()
    cls.greet = new_greet
    return cls

@greet_decorator
class Employee(Person):
    pass

print(Employee().greet())
```

What will be the output when this code is executed?  
A) HELLO, I AM A PERSON!  
B) HELLO, I AM AN EMPLOYEE!  
C) Hello, I am a Person!  
D) Hello, I am an Employee!
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):  
B) HELLO, I AM AN EMPLOYEE!

Explanation: The code defines a metaclass `Meta` that adds a `greet` method to any class it decorates. Then, the `Employee` class is decorated with both the `Meta` metaclass and a simple decorator `greet_decorator`. The `greet_decorator` modifies the `greet` method of the decorated class by making its output uppercase. Since `Employee` is first decorated with `Meta`, which adds a `greet` method, then with `greet_decorator`, the final `greet` method will output "Hello, I am an Employee!" in uppercase.
