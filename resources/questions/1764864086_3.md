    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def main():
    url = "http://example.com"
    data_task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data(url))
    result = await data_task
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

1. What will be the output of this script?
   A) Data from http://example.com  
   B) Task is created but not awaited  
   C) The script will hang indefinitely  
   D) AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'await'

2. How can you modify the `fetch_data` function to make it synchronous instead of asynchronous?
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] A) Data from http://example.com  
Explanation: When you run the script, it creates an asynchronous task using `asyncio.create_task(fetch_data(url))`, which schedules `fetch_data` to run in the background. The `main` function then awaits this task, which causes the program to pause until the task is completed and returns the result "Data from http://example.com".
