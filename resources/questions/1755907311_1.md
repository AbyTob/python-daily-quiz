    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to automatically add a `__str__` method to any class it decorates:

```python
class StrMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if '__str__' not in dct:
            dct['__str__'] = lambda self: f"{self.__class__.__name__}({', '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in self.__dict__.items())})"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Person(metaclass=StrMeta):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

person = Person("Alice", 30)
print(person)  # Should print: Person(name=Alice, age=30)
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `StrMeta` metaclass ensures that every class it decorates has a `__str__` method.
B) The `Person` class does not require any special handling for string representation because Python provides default methods.
C) The lambda function assigned to `__str__` will fail if the object has no attributes.
D) The metaclass only works with classes that define their own `__init__` method.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `StrMeta` metaclass ensures that every class it decorates has a `__str__` method.

Explanation: The `StrMeta` metaclass checks if the `__dict__` of the class being created contains the key `'__str__'`. If not, it adds a lambda function as the `__str__` method. This lambda function returns a string representation of the object in a readable format. Thus, every class that uses this metaclass will have a custom `__str__` method automatically added.
