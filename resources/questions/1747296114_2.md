    ## Question
    ### Question:
Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to create a context manager. The goal is to ensure that resources are properly managed, including logging when entering and exiting a block of code.

```python
import functools

def log_resource_access(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Entering {func.__name__}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Exiting {func.__name__}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_resource_access
def access_database():
    # Simulate database access
    print("Accessing database...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    access_database()
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The decorator `log_resource_access` ensures that the `access_database` function can only be called once.

B) When `access_database` is decorated with `@log_resource_access`, it logs entering and exiting the function, and then executes the actual database access logic.

C) The decorator `log_resource_access` will cause a syntax error when applied to any function.

D) Calling `access_database()` will not output any messages because the decorator does nothing.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Answer:
B) When `access_database` is decorated with `@log_resource_access`, it logs entering and exiting the function, and then executes the actual database access logic.

**Explanation:**
- The decorator `log_resource_access` wraps the original `access_database` function to add logging functionality before and after its execution.
- Inside the `wrapper` function, the message "Entering {func.__name__}" is printed when entering the function, followed by the execution of `func(*args, **kwargs)`, which performs the actual database access. Afterward, the message "Exiting {func.__name__}" is printed to indicate that the function has exited.
- This allows for monitoring and debugging purposes without modifying the original function logic.
