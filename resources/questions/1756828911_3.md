    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{self.func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f}s")
        return result

@Timer
def expensive_computation(n):
    return sum(i * i for i in range(n))

result = expensive_computation(1000000)
print(result)
```

What is the output of this code snippet?

A) 333332666750000.0, Timer executed in X.XXXs  
B) 333332666750000.0, expensive_computation executed in X.XXXs  
C) 3333333333.3333, Timer executed in X.XXXs  
D) 3333333333.3333, expensive_computation executed in X.XXXs
    
    ## Answer
    B) 333332666750000.0, expensive_computation executed in X.XXXs  
The `Timer` class is a decorator that measures the execution time of the function it decorates. When `expensive_computation(1000000)` is called, the `Timer` decorator wraps the call to this function and prints the execution time along with the result. The output will show the result of the computation followed by "expensive_computation executed in X.XXXs", where X.XXX represents the time taken to execute the function.
