    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_task():
    print("Task started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Completed"

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        task = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        result = loop.run_until_complete(task)
        return result

@AsyncDecorator
async def main():
    result = await async_task()
    print(result)

main()
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when `main` is called?

A) The `async_task` function starts immediately, and its result is printed as "Completed".

B) The `async_task` function waits for 1 second before printing "Completed".

C) An error occurs because you cannot call an asynchronous function directly with the `@AsyncDecorator`.

D) The `main` function returns a coroutine that needs to be awaited.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `async_task` function starts immediately, and its result is printed as "Completed".
