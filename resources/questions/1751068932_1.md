    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to database...")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

Now, imagine you want to enhance this singleton behavior so that the instance creation is thread-safe. Modify the `SingletonMeta` metaclass accordingly.

A. Use `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method.
B. Replace the `_instances` dictionary with an `OrderedDict`.
C. Use a context manager for the lock.
D. Implement `__new__` instead of `__call__`.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

A. Use `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method.

Explanation:
The correct answer is to use a `threading.Lock()` in the `__call__` method of the metaclass to ensure that instance creation is thread-safe. This approach involves creating an instance only if it does not already exist, and locking during this process to prevent multiple threads from creating different instances simultaneously. Here's how you can modify the code:

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
                cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to database...")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

In this solution, the `_lock` attribute of the metaclass ensures that only one thread can enter the `if cls not in cls._instances` block at a time, thus guaranteeing that the singleton property is maintained even when accessed from multiple threads.
