    **Part 1 (Question):**  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Modify or add attributes to the class dictionary
        if 'my_attr' not in dct:
            dct['my_attr'] = 'default_value'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Create an instance of MyClass and access my_attr
instance = MyClass()
print(instance.my_attr)
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when `MyClass` is instantiated?

A) The `my_attr` attribute is added to `MyClass` with a default value of 'default_value'.

B) An error occurs because `my_attr` is not defined in the class and no default value is provided.

C) The `my_attr` attribute from an instance of `MyClass` can be accessed but will raise an AttributeError since it's not explicitly set.

D) The `my_attr` attribute cannot be accessed from any instance of `MyClass`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**  
A) The `my_attr` attribute is added to `MyClass` with a default value of 'default_value'.

Explanation:
When the metaclass `Meta` is applied to `MyClass`, the `__new__` method of the metaclass is called. This method modifies or adds attributes to the class dictionary (`dct`) passed to it. Since `'my_attr'` is not in the dictionary, the metaclass adds it with a default value of 'default_value'. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and `my_attr` is accessed, it returns the value 'default_value' as added by the metaclass during class creation.
