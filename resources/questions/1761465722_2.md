    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses decorators to modify class behavior. The `LogCalls` decorator is designed to log the method calls of any decorated class. However, it fails when applied to asynchronous methods in an asynchronous class.

```python
import functools

def LogCalls(cls):
    for name, value in vars(cls).items():
        if callable(value) and not name.startswith("__"):
            setattr(cls, name, _log_calls(value))
    return cls

def _log_calls(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@LogCalls
class AsyncClass:
    async def async_method(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        return "Done"

# Usage
import asyncio

async def main():
    ac = AsyncClass()
    result = await ac.async_method()
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following best describes why `LogCalls` fails to work properly with asynchronous methods in the `AsyncClass`?

A) The decorator does not handle async functions.
B) The use of `functools.wraps` is incorrect for async methods.
C) The `await` keyword in the async method causes the decorator to fail.
D) There is no issue; the decorator works as intended.
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer: A) The decorator does not handle async functions.**

**Explanation:** The `LogCalls` decorator assumes that all methods it decorates are synchronous because it simply wraps them with a logging function using `functools.wraps`. However, asynchronous methods in Python need to be handled differently due to their non-blocking nature and the use of the `async`/`await` syntax. To correctly log calls to async methods, you would need to modify the decorator to handle the `async def` signature and ensure that the logging occurs within the context of an event loop or asynchronously as well.
