# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses both a decorator and a metaclass:

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'my_method' in dct:
            dct['my_method'] = my_decorator(dct['my_method'])
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def my_method(self):
        print("Hello, world!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    obj = MyClass()
    obj.my_method()
```

What will be the output of this code when executed? Additionally, how does the combination of a decorator and a metaclass in `MyClass` modify the behavior of `my_method`?

A) It prints "Hello, world!"  
B) It prints "Something is happening before the function is called." followed by "Hello, world!"  
C) The code will raise an error because decorators cannot be used with metaclasses.  
D) None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

**B) It prints "Something is happening before the function is called." followed by "Hello, world!"**

Explanation:

The combination of a decorator and a metaclass in this scenario modifies the behavior of `my_method` at class creation time. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and its method `my_method()` is called, the following happens:

1. The metaclass `Meta` is invoked during the class creation process.
2. Inside `Meta.__new__`, it checks if 'my_method' exists in the class dictionary (`dct`). Since it does, it decorates this method using the `my_decorator`.
3. The decorated `my_method` now adds a print statement before calling the original `my_method`.
4. When `obj.my_method()` is called on an instance of `MyClass`, it first executes the decorator's logic, printing "Something is happening before the function is called.", and then calls the original method, which prints "Hello, world!".

Thus, the correct output when running this code will be:

```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello, world!
```
