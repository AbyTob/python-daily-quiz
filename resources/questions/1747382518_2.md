    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to enhance a class method. The goal is to create a decorator that logs the arguments with which a method was called.

```python
def log_arguments(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Arguments: {args}, Keyword Arguments: {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class Calculator:
    @log_arguments
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y
```

Which of the following statements about this implementation is true?

A) The `log_arguments` decorator correctly logs both positional and keyword arguments for any method it decorates.

B) When `add(2, 3)` is called on an instance of `Calculator`, it will print "Arguments: (2, 3), Keyword Arguments: {}" before returning the result of the addition.

C) The `wrapper` function in the decorator replaces the original method's signature, leading to potential issues when the method's signature needs to be preserved.

D) The `log_arguments` decorator can be used on any method that does not require access to the instance (`self`) or class (`cls`) of the object it is called on.
    
    ## Answer
    B) When `add(2, 3)` is called on an instance of `Calculator`, it will print "Arguments: (2, 3), Keyword Arguments: {}" before returning the result of the addition.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because while the decorator correctly logs positional arguments, it does not log keyword arguments when they are provided.
- Option C is partially correct but misleading. The `wrapper` function does not replace the original method's signature; instead, it simply adds logging functionality around the method call without altering its interface.
- Option D is incorrect because if a method is decorated with `log_arguments`, it will receive an additional positional argument (`self`) when called as a class method, which might cause errors or unexpected behavior unless explicitly handled in the decorator.
