    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a custom decorator to measure the execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i
    return total
```

Which of the following modifications to the `compute_sum` function would correctly handle the case where the function is called with no arguments?

A) Change the decorator to accept default parameters.

B) Modify the `timer` decorator to ensure it handles functions without arguments gracefully.

C) Add a conditional inside the `wrapper` function to check if `args` and `kwargs` are empty.

D) None of the above. The current implementation is correct and robust.
    
    ## Answer
    B) Modify the `timer` decorator to ensure it handles functions without arguments gracefully.

Explanation: The current implementation of the `timer` decorator assumes that there will always be at least one argument (`func`) passed to it. If a function decorated with `@timer` does not accept any arguments, calling this function will result in a TypeError because the wrapper will not receive any positional or keyword arguments other than those intended for the wrapped function itself.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that our decorator can handle functions without arguments correctly. One way to do this is by modifying the `timer` decorator to check if `args` and `kwargs` are empty within the wrapper function and adjust its behavior accordingly. For example:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def compute_sum(n=1000):  # Added default argument to make the function callable without arguments
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i
    return total
```

This modification ensures that the `compute_sum` function can be called with or without an argument, and the `timer` decorator will still work correctly.
