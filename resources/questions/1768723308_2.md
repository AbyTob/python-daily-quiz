    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a class whose instances are singletons:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass(10)
obj2 = MyClass(20)

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Output: ?
```

What will be the output of `obj1 is obj2` when this code is executed?

A. True  
B. False  
C. SyntaxError  
D. NameError
    
    ## Answer
    B. False  

Explanation: 
The metaclass `SingletonMeta` ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created, regardless of how many times the class is instantiated. In this case, when both `obj1` and `obj2` are created, they point to the same instance stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `obj1 is obj2` will evaluate to True, indicating that they refer to the exact same object in memory.
