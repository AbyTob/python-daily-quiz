    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval
        self.tasks = []

    def add_task(self, coro):
        task = asyncio.create_task(coro)
        self.tasks.append(task)

    async def run(self):
        while True:
            for task in self.tasks:
                await task
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)

async def my_coroutine():
    print("Coroutine started")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Coroutine finished")

# Usage
timer = AsyncTimer(3)
timer.add_task(my_coroutine())
asyncio.run(timer.run())
```

What is the behavior of this code, and what will be printed to the console? Explain why.

A) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. The timer runs in an infinite loop every 3 seconds, but since there's only one task, it doesn't add any complexity.

B) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. After that, the program will print nothing as the timer is not running any more tasks.

C) The coroutine starts and stays alive indefinitely because the timer keeps scheduling itself to run every 3 seconds.

D) There will be an error because adding a task to the `AsyncTimer` instance does not start it immediately.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The coroutine starts, waits for 2 seconds, then finishes. The timer runs in an infinite loop every 3 seconds, but since there's only one task, it doesn't add any complexity.

The `run` method of the `AsyncTimer` class is designed to run indefinitely, continuously waiting for all tasks to complete before sleeping for the specified interval. Since the `my_coroutine` is added with a sleep duration of 2 seconds, it will complete after 2 seconds and then wait again for the next iteration of the timer loop (every 3 seconds). Therefore, the output will be "Coroutine started" followed by "Coroutine finished" every 3 seconds after the initial 2-second delay.
