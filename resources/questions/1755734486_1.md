    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):  
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def task(name, delay):
    print(f"Task {name} started")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Task {name} finished")

async def main():
    tasks = [task("A", 2), task("B", 1)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# Run the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the output of this code when run?

A) Task A started, Task B started, Task B finished, Task A finished  
B) Task A started, Task B started, Task A finished, Task B finished  
C) Task A started, Task A finished, Task B started, Task B finished  
D) Error: Tasks are not being awaited properly
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):  
A) Task A started, Task B started, Task B finished, Task A finished

**Explanation:** The `asyncio.gather` function runs all the tasks concurrently. In this case, "Task B" starts first as it has a shorter delay than "Task A". Both tasks run simultaneously and complete in order of their completion time, resulting in the output shown above.
