# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator and a metaclass together:

```python
from functools import wraps

class Meta(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        super().__init__(name, bases, dct)
        print(f"Class {name} created with Meta")

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before function call")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After function call")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Create an instance of MyClass and call its method
instance = MyClass(10)
```

What will be the output when you run this code? Explain why.

A) Class MyClass created with Meta  
   Before function call  
   After function call  

B) Class MyClass created with Meta  
   Before function call  
   After function call  
   10  

C) Class MyClass created with Meta  
   Before function call  
   After function call  
   Error  

D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A) Class MyClass created with Meta  
   Before function call  
   After function call  

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` is called when `MyClass` is defined, printing "Class MyClass created with Meta".
- The decorator `my_decorator` wraps the constructor (`__init__`) of `MyClass`, but since no method calls are made on an instance in this code snippet, only the `__init__` call is intercepted.
- When you create an instance of `MyClass(10)`, the `__init__` method is called through the decorator, which prints "Before function call" and "After function call". However, no return value is printed because `None` is returned from the decorator's wrapper by default.

Option B is incorrect because there are no print statements for the instance's attribute.
Option C is incorrect because there are no errors; all parts of the code execute as expected.
Option D is incorrect because option A correctly describes the output.
