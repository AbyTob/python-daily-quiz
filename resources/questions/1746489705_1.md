    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=Singleton):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

def create_instance(value):
    obj = MyClass(value)
    return obj

# Usage:
instance1 = create_instance(10)
instance2 = create_instance(20)

print(instance1 == instance2)  # Output: ?
print(instance1.value)       # Output: ?
```

What will be the output of `instance1 == instance2` and `instance1.value` when the code is executed?

A. True, 10  
B. False, 10  
C. True, 20  
D. False, 20
    
    ## Answer
    A. True, 10  

Explanation: The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created, no matter how many times it is instantiated. When `instance1 = create_instance(10)` is executed, an instance with `value=10` is created and stored in `_instances`. Then, when `instance2 = create_instance(20)` is called, the existing instance from `_instances` (which has `value=10`) is returned. Therefore, `instance1 == instance2` evaluates to True because they refer to the same object. Additionally, since both instances are the same, `instance1.value` also returns 10.
