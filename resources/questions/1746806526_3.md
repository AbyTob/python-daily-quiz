**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator for measuring the execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    """Computes the sum of numbers from 1 to n."""
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))

compute_sum(100000)
```

Which of the following is a correct statement about the `timing_decorator`?

A) The decorator correctly measures and prints the execution time of any function it decorates.  
B) When applied to `compute_sum`, the decorator will print the execution time without modifying its return value.  
C) Applying this decorator to a coroutine function will raise an error because coroutines are not supported by this decorator.  
D) The decorator will cause a stack overflow due to excessive recursion when used with large inputs.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When applied to `compute_sum`, the decorator will print the execution time without modifying its return value.

Explanation: The provided decorator, `timing_decorator`, is correctly implemented. It measures the time taken by the function it decorates (`func`) and prints this duration. However, it does not modify the return value of the function being decorated. Therefore, when `compute_sum(100000)` is called with the `@timing_decorator` applied, it will print the execution time and then return the result of `sum(range(1))`, which is 5000050000, as expected.

The decorator can be used with coroutine functions without issues. However, in Python, decorators are not directly applicable to coroutines due to differences in how they are executed and awaited, so attempting to use a timing decorator on a coroutine would not raise an error but would likely not function as intended. The decorator's implementation here is straightforward and does not involve complex interactions that could lead to errors with coroutines or cause stack overflows.
