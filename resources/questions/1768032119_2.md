    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def compute_squares(n):
    return [i * i for i in range(n)]

async def async_compute_squares(n):
    return [i * i for i in range(n)]
```

Which of the following statements is true about the provided code?

A) `compute_squares` and `async_compute_squares` are equivalent in terms of functionality.

B) The `timing_decorator` can be applied to both synchronous and asynchronous functions without any changes.

C) Calling `compute_squares(1000000)` will execute synchronously and print the time taken.

D) Using `asyncio.run(async_compute_squares(1000000))` will execute asynchronously and print the time taken.
    
    ## Answer
    C) Calling `compute_squares(1000000)` will execute synchronously and print the time taken.

Explanation: The `compute_squares` function is a synchronous function, and when decorated with `@timing_decorator`, it measures and prints the execution time. However, the `async_compute_squares` function is an asynchronous function designed to run within an asyncio event loop. Calling it directly without using an async context (like `asyncio.run()`) will not execute it asynchronously; instead, it will block until completion, similar to a synchronous call, which could lead to performance issues if called frequently in a non-async context.
