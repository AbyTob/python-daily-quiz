    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question)

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, delay):
        self.delay = delay

    async def start(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(self.delay)
        print(f"Timer expired after {self.delay} seconds")

async def main():
    timer = AsyncTimer(3)
    task = asyncio.create_task(timer.start())
    await task
    print("Main function completed")

# Run the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this code when executed? Explain why.

A) The program will hang indefinitely  
B) "Timer expired after 3 seconds" followed by "Main function completed"  
C) "Main function completed" followed by "Timer expired after 3 seconds"  
D) An error will occur
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer)

**Correct Answer: B) "Timer expired after 3 seconds" followed by "Main function completed"**

**Explanation:**

The code defines an `AsyncTimer` class that has a method `start` which simulates a timer using `asyncio.sleep`. In the `main` function, an instance of `AsyncTimer` is created with a delay of 3 seconds. The `start` method is called on this instance and executed as a task in the event loop.

When you run the `main` function using `asyncio.run(main())`, it creates a task for `timer.start()` and then waits for this task to complete before printing "Main function completed". Since the `start` method sleeps for 3 seconds, the output will be:

1. The program prints "Timer expired after 3 seconds" after waiting for 3 seconds.
2. After the sleep completes, it prints "Main function completed".

Therefore, option B is correct as it accurately reflects the expected order and timing of the output.
