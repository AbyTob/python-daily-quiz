    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]
    
@Singleton
class DatabaseConnection:
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to the database...")

def use_database():
    db1 = DatabaseConnection()
    db2 = DatabaseConnection()
    db1.connect()
    print(db1 is db2)

use_database()
```

What does the code above do and why?

A) It prints "Connecting to the database..." twice because `db1` and `db2` are separate instances.

B) It prints "Connecting to the database..." once and then `True`, indicating that `db1` and `db2` are the same instance.

C) It raises an error because a singleton class cannot be instantiated with parameters.

D) It prints "Connecting to the database..." twice but does not compare instances.
    
    ## Answer
    B) It prints "Connecting to the database..." once and then `True`, indicating that `db1` and `db2` are the same instance.

Explanation: The `Singleton` metaclass ensures that only one instance of the `DatabaseConnection` class can be created. When `use_database()` is called, it creates two variables (`db1` and `db2`) that both reference the same instance of `DatabaseConnection`. Therefore, calling `connect()` on either variable results in a single "Connecting to the database..." message being printed, and `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`, demonstrating that they are indeed the same object.
