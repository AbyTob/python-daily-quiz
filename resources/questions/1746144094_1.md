    [QUESTION]
**Question:** Consider the following Python code snippet which uses a metaclass to ensure that only one instance of a class can be created:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: ?
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the output of `print(db1 is db2)`?

A) True  
B) False  
C) The code will raise an error  
D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer:** A) True

**Explanation:**  
The provided metaclass, `SingletonMeta`, ensures that only one instance of any class using it can be created. In this case, when `db1` and `db2` are instantiated from the `Database` class, the `__call__` method of the metaclass is invoked. Since `_instances[cls]` is checked for `SingletonMeta`, and since no other instance exists in `_instances`, both `db1` and `db2` will reference the same instance stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`.
