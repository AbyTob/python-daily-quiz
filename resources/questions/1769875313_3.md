    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, timeout):
        self.timeout = timeout

    async def wait(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(self.timeout)
        print(f"Timer expired after {self.timeout} seconds")

async def main():
    timers = [AsyncTimer(i) for i in range(1, 4)]
    tasks = [timer.wait() for timer in timers]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    asyncio.run(main())
    print(f"Total execution time: {time.time() - start_time} seconds")
```

Which of the following statements is true about the performance of this script?

A) The timers are executed concurrently, and the total execution time should be approximately 3 seconds.

B) The timers are executed sequentially, and the total execution time should be approximately 6 seconds.

C) The timers are not truly asynchronous; they block the event loop and do not improve performance.

D) There is an error in the code that prevents it from running correctly.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The timers are executed concurrently, and the total execution time should be approximately 3 seconds.

Explanation: The `asyncio.gather` function runs the tasks concurrently. Since each task simply waits for a fixed amount of time using `asyncio.sleep`, the total execution time is dominated by the longest individual wait time, which is 3 seconds in this case (waiting times are 1, 2, and 3 seconds respectively). Therefore, the script executes approximately as fast as if it were running three sequential sleeps, resulting in a total execution time close to 3 seconds.
