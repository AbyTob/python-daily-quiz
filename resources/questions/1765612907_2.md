    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to create a decorator which counts how many times a function has been called:

```python
def count_calls(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        wrapper.count += 1
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    wrapper.count = 0
    return wrapper

@count_calls
def my_function():
    print("Function called!")

# Using the decorated function a few times
my_function()
my_function()
my_function()

print(f"Function was called {my_function.count} times.")
```

What is an issue with this code that prevents it from working as intended?

A) The `wrapper` function does not have access to its own `count` attribute.
B) Each call to `my_function()` resets the `count`.
C) The `count_calls` decorator should be a class instead of a function.
D) Python does not support mutable default arguments.
    
    ## Answer
    Answer: A

Explanation:
The issue with this code is that the `wrapper.count = 0` statement is executed every time the `count_calls` decorator is applied to a function, resetting the count to zero for each new application. As a result, the count will only reflect how many times the most recently decorated function has been called, not the total number of calls across all functions using this decorator. To fix this issue, you can use a nonlocal variable or encapsulate the count within an inner class if using a class-based approach.
