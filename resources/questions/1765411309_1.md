# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses metaclasses to create a logging mechanism for class instantiation:

```python
class LoggerMeta(type):
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Instantiated {cls.__name__}")
        return instance

class MyClass(metaclass=LoggerMeta):
    pass

# Usage
my_instance = MyClass()
```

What will be the output of the code when executed?

A) An error indicating that `LoggerMeta` does not define a `__call__` method.

B) The text "Instantiated MyClass" printed to the console along with an empty string.

C) The text "Instantiated MyClass" printed to the console followed by the memory address of `my_instance`.

D) No output, only the creation of `my_instance` without any logging.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is C: The text "Instantiated MyClass" printed to the console followed by the memory address of `my_instance`.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `LoggerMeta` overrides the `__call__` method, which is called when a class is instantiated.
- Inside the `__call__` method, it first calls the superclass's `__call__` method to actually create the instance.
- After creating the instance, it prints the name of the class being instantiated.
- Finally, it returns the newly created instance.

When you run the code with `my_instance = MyClass()`, the output will be:
```
Instantiated MyClass
<__main__.MyClass object at 0x...>
```

Where `<__main__.MyClass object at 0x...>` is the memory address of `my_instance`.
