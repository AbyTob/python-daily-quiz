    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method dynamically to all classes defined by it:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['dynamic_method'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {name}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class A(metaclass=Meta): pass
class B(metaclass=Meta): pass

def test_classes():
    a = A()
    b = B()

    assert a.dynamic_method() == "Hello from A"
    assert b.dynamic_method() == "Hello from B"

test_classes()
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `dynamic_method` will only be added to instances of class `A`.

B) The `dynamic_method` will not be accessible on any instances.

C) The `dynamic_method` will be dynamically added to all classes defined by the metaclass `Meta`, and both instances `a` and `b` can call it successfully.

D) There is a syntax error in the code that prevents the dynamic method from being added.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The `dynamic_method` will be dynamically added to all classes defined by the metaclass `Meta`, and both instances `a` and `b` can call it successfully.
