    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Data fetched"

def log_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__}")
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_decorator
async def process_data():
    data = await fetch_data()
    return f"Processed: {data}"

# Usage
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = loop.run_until_complete(process_data())
print(result)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the code above?

A) The `fetch_data` function will run synchronously.
B) The `process_data` function will not be logged by the `log_decorator`.
C) The `wrapper` function inside `log_decorator` does not handle exceptions from the decorated function.
D) The `log_decorator` correctly logs the name, arguments, and return value of both synchronous and asynchronous functions.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
C

Explanation: 
- A) Incorrect. The `fetch_data` function is marked with `async`, indicating it's an asynchronous function that will run asynchronously using asyncio.
- B) Correct. The `log_decorator` logs the name of the function, its arguments, and return value correctly. Since both `fetch_data` and `process_data` are asynchronous functions, their behavior is logged as expected by the decorator.
- C) Incorrect. The `wrapper` function inside `log_decorator` properly handles any exceptions raised by the decorated function using a try-except block within the wrapper.
- D) Incorrect. The `log_decorator` correctly logs the name and return value of both synchronous (if converted to async context managers or similar patterns) and asynchronous functions, provided they are wrapped by `@asyncio.coroutine` or use the `async/await` syntax as shown here.
