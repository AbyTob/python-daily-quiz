    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a class with specific behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'x' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Attribute 'x' is missing")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    x = 10
```

What will happen when you try to create an instance of `MyClass` and why?

A) An error will occur because `x` is not defined in `MyClass`.

B) The class will be instantiated successfully with `x` set to 10.

C) An error will occur because the metaclass does not implement `__new__`.

D) The class will be instantiated successfully, but `x` will not be set.
    
    ## Answer
    [B] The class will be instantiated successfully with `x` set to 10. 

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks if the attribute `x` is present in the dictionary of the new class being created. Since `x` is defined as `x = 10` in `MyClass`, the metaclass does not raise an error, and the class is instantiated successfully with `x` set to 10.
