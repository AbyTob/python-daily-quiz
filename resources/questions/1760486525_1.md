    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def slow_task(task_id, delay):
    print(f"Task {task_id} started")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Task {task_id} completed")
    return f"Result of Task {task_id}"

async def main():
    tasks = [slow_task(i, i*2) for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

# Run the async main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the expected output of this program and why?

A) It will print: Task 0 started, Task 1 started, Task 2 started, Task 3 started, Task 4 started, Task 0 completed, Task 1 completed, Task 2 completed, Task 3 completed, Task 4 completed, and then the results of all tasks.

B) It will print: Task 0 started, Task 1 started, Task 2 started, Task 3 started, Task 4 started, but only one task will complete at a time due to asyncio's event loop scheduling.

C) It will raise an exception because `asyncio.sleep` cannot be used in an asynchronous context.

D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    B) It will print: Task 0 started, Task 1 started, Task 2 started, Task 3 started, Task 4 started, but only one task will complete at a time due to asyncio's event loop scheduling.

Explanation:
The `asyncio.gather` function runs all tasks concurrently. However, the `await asyncio.sleep(delay)` line causes each task to pause for a certain duration (in this case, increasing delay for each task). Due to Python's single-threaded nature and the way `asyncio` manages its event loop, only one coroutine can execute at a time on the CPU while waiting for IO operations like sleeping. Therefore, even though all tasks are started immediately, they will not complete in parallel; instead, they will be executed one after another in the order of their start.
