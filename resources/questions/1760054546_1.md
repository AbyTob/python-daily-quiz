    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a Singleton class. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super(SingletonMeta, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class SingletonClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0

# Example usage:
singleton1 = SingletonClass()
singleton2 = SingletonClass()

singleton1.value += 1

print(singleton1.value)  # Output: 1
print(singleton2.value)  # Output: 1
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A. The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `SingletonClass` can be created.
B. When creating a new instance of `SingletonClass`, if an instance already exists, it will be re-created with default arguments.
C. The `_instances` dictionary is used to store all instances of classes using this metaclass.
D. If multiple threads try to create an instance of `SingletonClass` simultaneously, they will each get their own instance.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A. This statement is correct. The `SingletonMeta` metaclass uses a dictionary `_instances` to store instances of classes using this metaclass. When an instance is created, it checks if the class already exists in `_instances`. If not, it creates a new one and stores it. Subsequent calls return the stored instance.

B. This statement is incorrect. When creating a new instance of `SingletonClass`, if an instance already exists, it will not be re-created with default arguments. Instead, the existing instance is returned.

C. This statement is partially correct but misleading. The `_instances` dictionary stores instances of classes using this metaclass, not all instances. It's more accurate to say that it stores the singleton instances for each class that uses `SingletonMeta`.

D. This statement is incorrect. If multiple threads try to create an instance of `SingletonClass` simultaneously, they will actually share the same instance due to the thread-safe nature of checking and setting `_instances[cls]`. However, Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, so in practice, all threads will see the same instance.
