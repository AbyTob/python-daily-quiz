    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

def thread_safety(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        lock = threading.Lock()
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@thread_safety
def increment_counter():
    global counter
    counter += 1

counter = 0

threads = []
for _ in range(1000):
    t = threading.Thread(target=increment_counter)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

What is the issue with this code, and what is a potential solution to ensure thread safety?

A) The `thread_safety` decorator does not work as intended because it reuses the same lock for all invocations.
B) The global variable `counter` is not properly declared as `global` inside the decorated function.
C) There is no need for a lock since Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents threads from running at the same time.
D) The decorator is correctly implemented, and it will ensure that `increment_counter` runs safely in multiple threads.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The correct answer is A. The issue with this code is that the `thread_safety` decorator does not work as intended because it reuses the same lock for all invocations. Each call to `increment_counter` should have its own lock, or the lock should be thread-local.

A potential solution is to use a lock per instance or to create a new lock each time the function is called:

```python
import threading

def thread_safety(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        lock = threading.Lock()
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class ThreadSafeCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.counter = 0

    @thread_safety
    def increment(self):
        self.counter += 1

counter = ThreadSafeCounter()

threads = []
for _ in range(1000):
    t = threading.Thread(target=counter.increment)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

In this modified version, each instance of `ThreadSafeCounter` has its own lock, ensuring thread safety.
