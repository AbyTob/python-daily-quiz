    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_task():
    print("Task started")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Task completed"

class AsyncContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        print("Entering context manager")
        return self
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print("Exiting context manager")

async def main():
    async with AsyncContextManager() as cm:
        result = await async_task()
        print(result)

# Run the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be printed to the console when running this code?

A) Entering context manager  
   Task started  
   Exiting context manager  
   Task completed  

B) Entering context manager  
   Task started  
   Task completed  
   Exiting context manager  

C) Exiting context manager  
   Task started  
   Entering context manager  
   Task completed  

D) Task started  
   Entering context manager  
   Exiting context manager  
   Task completed
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) Entering context manager  
   Task started  
   Task completed  
   Exiting context manager

Explanation:
- The `async with` statement first calls the `__aenter__` method of the `AsyncContextManager`, which prints "Entering context manager".
- Then, it awaits the execution of `async_task()`. Since this is an asynchronous function, it does not block the event loop. Instead, it schedules the task to run later and proceeds with other tasks or returns control to the caller.
- When the await completes (after 2 seconds), "Task completed" is printed.
- Finally, after the `async_task()` coroutine has finished, the `__aexit__` method of the `AsyncContextManager` is called, printing "Exiting context manager".
