    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a metaclass to ensure a class can only be instantiated once:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Usage example
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # What will this print?
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what happens when the `Singleton` class is instantiated twice?

A) It creates two separate instances, and `s1 is s2` returns `False`.
B) It raises an exception, as only one instance can be created.
C) It creates only one instance, and `s1 is s2` returns `True`.
D) It reuses the existing instance for both `s1` and `s2`, but `s1 is s2` still returns `False`.
    
    ## Answer
    C) It creates only one instance, and `s1 is s2` returns `True`.

**Explanation:** The `SingletonMeta` metaclass overrides the `__call__` method to ensure that whenever an instantiation of `Singleton` is attempted, it checks if an instance already exists. If not, it creates a new one; otherwise, it returns the existing instance. This behavior demonstrates the Singleton design pattern, where only one instance of the class can exist. Therefore, both `s1` and `s2` refer to the same object, and `s1 is s2` will return `True`.
