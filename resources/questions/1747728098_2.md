    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching data from {url}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def main():
    urls = ["http://example.com", "http://example.org", "http://example.net"]
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print("All data fetched:", results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    asyncio.run(main())
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

What is the expected output of this script, and how does it illustrate a fundamental principle of Python's asyncio library?

A) The script will fetch data from each URL sequentially and then print all results together.
B) The script will fetch data concurrently from all URLs and then print all results at once.
C) The script will raise an exception because `asyncio.sleep` is not allowed in async functions.
D) The script will hang indefinitely because it does not handle exceptions.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The script will fetch data concurrently from all URLs and then print all results at once. This illustrates a fundamental principle of Python's asyncio library that allows for concurrent execution, which can lead to significant performance improvements when dealing with I/O-bound tasks like fetching data over the network.
