    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a simple caching mechanism using decorators:

```python
import functools

def cache(func):
    cached_results = {}
    
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if args not in cached_results:
            cached_results[args] = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return cached_results[args]
    return wrapper

@cache
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage:
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output should be 5, and cache should store the results of previous calls
```

Which statement correctly describes a potential issue with this caching mechanism using decorators?

A) The `cache` decorator does not handle keyword arguments properly, leading to incorrect cache lookups.

B) The `fibonacci` function will run inefficiently because it does not use memoization.

C) The `functools.wraps` is unnecessary in this context and can be removed without affecting the functionality.

D) The `cached_results` dictionary is not thread-safe, so concurrent calls may lead to incorrect results or errors.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] A) The `cache` decorator does not handle keyword arguments properly, leading to incorrect cache lookups.

**Explanation:** While using `functools.wraps(func)` is generally a good practice for decorators, the issue in this code arises from how it handles caching. The decorator uses `args` (positionals only) for caching keys without considering `kwargs`. This means that two calls with the same positional arguments but different keyword arguments will not be cached separately, leading to incorrect cache lookups and potential performance issues or wrong results.
