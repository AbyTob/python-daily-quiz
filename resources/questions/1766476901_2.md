    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure all subclasses have a specific method:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'required_method' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Class must implement required_method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Base(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class Derived(Base):
    pass
```

Which of the following scenarios will raise a `TypeError` when trying to create an instance of `Derived`?

A) Subclassing `Base` without implementing `required_method`
B) Calling `Derived()` directly
C) Using a decorator to check for `required_method` at runtime
D) Implementing `required_method` in the `Derived` class
    
    ## Answer
    A) Subclassing `Base` without implementing `required_method`

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` enforces that any subclass of `Base` must implement the `required_method`. If a subclass does not implement this method, attempting to create an instance of that subclass will raise a `TypeError`, as shown in option A. Options B through D do not directly violate the metaclass constraint and thus would not raise the error when creating an instance of `Derived`.
