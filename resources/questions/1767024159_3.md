# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a decorator which logs function calls with their arguments. The goal is to understand how decorators can be used for debugging or logging purposes.

```python
import functools

def log_function_call(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} called with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}, returned: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_function_call
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

@log_function_call
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

add(3, 4)
multiply(5, 6)
```

What happens when you run this code? Why might it not work as expected?

A) The `log_function_call` decorator works correctly and logs the function calls with their arguments.

B) The decorator causes a TypeError because positional arguments are being unpacked incorrectly in the print statement.

C) The decorator logs the function calls but does not return the results of the functions.

D) The decorator fails to log any function calls because it is not applied properly.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `log_function_call` decorator works correctly and logs the function calls with their arguments.

Explanation: The `functools.wraps(func)` decorator preserves the metadata of the original function being decorated, including its name and docstring. When you run this code, it will log the function calls and return their results as expected. Here's what happens:

1. `add(3, 4)` is called.
2. The `log_function_call` decorator logs: "Function add called with args: (3, 4), kwargs: {}, returned: 7".
3. It then returns the result of `add(3, 4)`, which is `7`.

4. `multiply(5, 6)` is called.
5. The `log_function_call` decorator logs: "Function multiply called with args: (5, 6), kwargs: {}, returned: 30".
6. It then returns the result of `multiply(5, 6)`, which is `30`.

Therefore, option A is correct as the decorator works correctly and achieves its intended purpose without any issues related to argument unpacking or other errors mentioned in the other options.
