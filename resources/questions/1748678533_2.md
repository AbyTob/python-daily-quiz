    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a decorator that adds a timing mechanism to any function it decorates:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def my_function():
    time.sleep(2)

my_function()
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The decorator correctly measures and prints the execution time of `my_function`.
B) There's a mistake in the decorator that prevents it from working as intended.
C) Using decorators for timing can significantly impact the performance of decorated functions due to the overhead introduced.
D) All functions decorated with `@timer` will have their execution time printed when called.
    
    ## Answer
    [A] The decorator correctly measures and prints the execution time of `my_function`.

**Explanation:** This statement is incorrect. While the decorator does correctly measure the time taken by the function, it incorrectly calculates the total time as the sum of the start and end times instead of their difference. As a result, the output will be `Function my_function took 0.0 seconds to execute.` because `end_time - start_time` is not being computed properly.

[B] There's a mistake in the decorator that prevents it from working as intended.

**Explanation:** This statement is correct. The error lies in how the timing calculation is performed. It should be `end_time - start_time`, not `start_time + end_time`. This small mistake will result in incorrect timing values being printed.

[C] Using decorators for timing can significantly impact the performance of decorated functions due to the overhead introduced.

**Explanation:** This statement is correct. Decorators add a layer of indirection, which introduces some overhead. While the impact might not be noticeable for very short functions, it could become significant when applied to performance-critical code.

[D] All functions decorated with `@timer` will have their execution time printed when called.

**Explanation:** This statement is correct. The decorator `timer` is correctly defined and applied to `my_function`, so when `my_function()` is called, its execution time will be printed.
