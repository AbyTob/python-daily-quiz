    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a metaclass which adds a new method `greet` to all classes it decorates:

```python
class GreetMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Greeter(metaclass=GreetMeta):
    pass

class Person(Greeter):
    pass
```

What will be the output when running `person = Person(); print(person.greet())`?

A) `Hello from Person`
B) `TypeError: 'greet' takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`
C) `AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute 'greet'`
D) The code will not run and throw an error
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer**: A) `Hello from Person`

**Explanation**:  
In the provided code, the metaclass `GreetMeta` adds a `greet` method to any class it decorates. This method is defined as a lambda function that takes `self` and returns a string greeting with the class name. When you create an instance of `Person`, calling `person.greet()` will correctly execute this lambda function, outputting "Hello from Person". The lambda function implicitly captures the `self` parameter correctly within its scope, so there are no type errors or attribute errors as might be expected if the method were incorrectly defined.
