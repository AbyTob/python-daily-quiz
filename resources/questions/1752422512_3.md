    ## Question
    ### Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator to track the execution time of functions. Your task is to modify this code so that it also tracks the number of times each function has been called.

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def expensive_function():
    for i in range(1000000):
        pass

# Call the function a few times
for _ in range(3):
    expensive_function()
```

Which of the following modifications should be made to `timer` to track both execution time and call count?

A) Add a counter dictionary inside the wrapper and increment it each time the function is called.

B) Use a closure to maintain a separate counter for each decorated function.

C) Introduce a global variable that increments each time any function decorated by `timer` is called.

D) Modify the decorator to use a context manager instead of a function wrapper.
    
    ## Answer
    ### Part 2 (Answer):
**B)** Use a closure to maintain a separate counter for each decorated function.

Explanation:
- The original `timer` decorator wraps a function and prints its execution time. To track how many times the function has been called, we need a way to keep track of this count separately for each function.
- A closure (an inner function that captures variables from an enclosing scope) allows us to maintain state between function calls without using global variables or classes.
- By creating a counter inside the `wrapper` function and incrementing it every time the function is called, we can achieve our goal of tracking both execution time and call count. This approach ensures that each decorated function maintains its own independent count of how many times it has been invoked.
