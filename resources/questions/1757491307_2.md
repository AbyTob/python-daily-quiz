    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses decorators and a metaclass together. The goal is to create a class that automatically adds a method to any subclass that matches a specific pattern.

```python
def add_method_to_subclasses(cls):
    def new_method(self):
        return "Method added by decorator"
    
    for name in dir(cls):
        if isinstance(getattr(cls, name), type) and name.endswith("_method"):
            setattr(cls, f"{name}_impl", new_method)
    return cls

class Meta(type):
    @classmethod
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@add_method_to_subclasses
class Base(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class Sub(Base):
    def method_to_add_method(self):
        pass

print(Sub.method_to_add_method_impl())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior of this code?

A) When an instance of `Sub` calls `method_to_add_method`, it will return "Method added by decorator".
B) The metaclass `Meta` does not affect the creation of `Sub`.
C) The decorator `add_method_to_subclasses` does not modify `Base`.
D) An AttributeError will be raised when trying to access `Sub.method_to_add_method_impl`.
    
    ## Answer
    A

The decorator `add_method_to_subclasses` correctly identifies subclasses that contain a method ending with "_method" and adds an implementation for the corresponding "_impl" method. The metaclass `Meta` does not interfere with this process as it is called after the class has been defined and modified by the decorator. Therefore, when you create an instance of `Sub` and call `method_to_add_method_impl`, it correctly returns "Method added by decorator".
