    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses both a metaclass and decorators:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name in dct:
            if callable(dct[attr_name]):
                dct[attr_name] = my_decorator(dct[attr_name])
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def method1(self):
        print("Method 1")

    def method2(self):
        print("Method 2")
```

What will be the output of the following code when `MyClass` is instantiated and its methods are called?

```python
obj = MyClass()
obj.method1()
obj.method2()
```

A) Something is happening before the function is called. Method 1  
   Something is happening after the function is called.  
   Something is happening before the function is called. Method 2  
   Something is happening after the function is called.

B) Method 1  
   Method 2

C) TypeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'method1'

D) MemoryError: Out of memory
    
    ## Answer
    A) Something is happening before the function is called. Method 1  
   Something is happening after the function is called.  
   Something is happening before the function is called. Method 2  
   Something is happening after the function is called.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` is used to automatically decorate all callable attributes (methods) of any class using it with the `my_decorator`. This decorator adds print statements before and after the method call.
- When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the metaclass ensures that `method1` and `method2` are wrapped in the decorator.
- Therefore, when you call `obj.method1()` and `obj.method2()`, you see the additional print statements indicating what happens before and after each method call.
