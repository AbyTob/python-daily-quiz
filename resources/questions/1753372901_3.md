    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a metaclass to modify a class's behavior. The goal is to ensure that any class created with this metaclass will have its `__init__` method automatically decorated with a logging decorator that logs when an instance of the class is initialized.

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_init(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Initializing {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if '__init__' in dct:
            dct['__init__'] = log_init(dct['__init__'])
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Example usage
obj = MyClass(10)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the use of this metaclass and its impact on `MyClass`?

A) The `__init__` method of `MyClass` will not be executed because it's been replaced by the logging decorator.
B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, the `__init__` method will automatically log that it is being initialized with a value of 10.
C) The metaclass modifies `MyClass` so that any other methods added to it in the future will also be decorated by `log_init`.
D) The logging decorator will only work if `MyClass` is instantiated using keyword arguments.
