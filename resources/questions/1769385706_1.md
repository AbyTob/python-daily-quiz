    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Data"

async def process_data(data):
    print(f"Processing {data}...")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data())
    data = await task
    await process_data(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

How can you modify the `main` function to run both `fetch_data` and `process_data` concurrently and measure the total time taken for both operations? Use proper asyncio constructs to achieve this.

A) Modify `main` to use `asyncio.gather` on the tasks created by `create_task`.

B) Directly call `fetch_data()` and `process_data()` without creating tasks.

C) Use `await` on `task` before starting `process_data`.

D) Create a new task for `process_data` but do not wait for it to complete.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Modify `main` to use `asyncio.gather` on the tasks created by `create_task`.

Explanation: The correct answer is A. To run both `fetch_data` and `process_data` concurrently, you need to create tasks for both functions using `asyncio.create_task`. Then, you should use `asyncio.gather` to wait for both tasks to complete. This will measure the total time taken for both operations efficiently by utilizing asyncio's asynchronous execution capabilities.
