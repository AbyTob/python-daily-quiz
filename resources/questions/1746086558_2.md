    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a context manager that logs the time taken for each block of code it decorates. However, you want this logging to be performed asynchronously, so that it does not block the main execution flow. Your task is to design such a context manager using Python's `asyncio` library.

Here's a partially implemented version of your context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f"Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds")

# Example usage:
async def main():
    async with AsyncTimerContextManager() as timer:
        # Simulate some asynchronous work
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("Work completed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

However, this code has an issue: it does not correctly handle exceptions that might occur within the `with` block. You need to ensure that any exceptions raised inside the `with` block are propagated and handled by the caller of `async with`.

What change should you make to the `AsyncTimerContextManager` class to correctly propagate exceptions?

A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

B) Wrap the code that calculates and logs the duration in a try-except block.

C) Remove the `return self` statement from the `__aenter__` method.

D) Change the `log_time_taken` method to be an instance method instead of a static method.
    
    ## Answer
    A) Add a check for `exc_type` inside the `__aexit__` method and re-raise the exception if it is not `None`.

The correct answer is A. In the `__aexit__` method, you should add a condition to check if an exception occurred (`if exc_type`). If an exception did occur, you should re-raise it using `raise exc_val from exc_tb`. This ensures that any exceptions raised within the `with` block are propagated and handled correctly by the caller of `async with`.

Here's the corrected version of the context manager:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimerContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        if exc_type is None:
            await self.log_time_taken(end_time - self.start_time)
        else:
            raise exc_val from exc_tb

    @staticmethod
    async def log_time_taken(duration):
        print(f"Time taken: {duration:.2f} seconds")

# Example usage remains the same
```

This implementation ensures that exceptions are correctly propagated, allowing for proper error handling in the code using the context manager.
