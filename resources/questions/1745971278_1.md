    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['new_attr'] = 'Hello from metaclass'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.new_attr)
```

What will be the output when running this code?

A) Error  
B) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'new_attr'  
C) Hello from metaclass  
D) None
    
    ## Answer
    C) Hello from metaclass

Explanation:
The `Meta` class is a metaclass that dynamically adds an attribute `new_attr` to any class it's applied to. When the `MyClass` class is defined, the `Meta` metaclass modifies its dictionary to include `new_attr`. This new attribute is accessible as an instance attribute when creating an instance of `MyClass`, hence printing "Hello from metaclass".
