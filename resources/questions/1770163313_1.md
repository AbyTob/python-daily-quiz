    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Implement a decorator that measures the execution time of any asynchronous function and prints it. Use `asyncio` for handling the timing. The decorator should be able to handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions seamlessly.

```python
import asyncio

# Your decorator implementation goes here

@measure_execution_time
async def async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Async task completed"

def sync_function():
    import time
    time.sleep(1)
    return "Sync task completed"
```

**Options:**
A) The code will run without any issues and measure the execution time for both `async_function` and `sync_function`.

B) The decorator will only work with asynchronous functions and will raise an error when applied to synchronous functions.

C) The decorator will not correctly measure the execution time as it does not account for the time spent waiting in `asyncio.sleep`.

D) The code will compile but the output will be incorrect because the decorator measures the time from the moment of calling the decorator, not the actual function call.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**A) The code will run without any issues and measure the execution time for both `async_function` and `sync_function`.**

Explanation: This option is correct because the decorator should be able to handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions. For an asynchronous function, it would use `asyncio.run()` to measure the total execution time including waiting times. For a synchronous function, it would simply use `time.time()` to get the execution time. Both scenarios are correctly handled in this approach.
