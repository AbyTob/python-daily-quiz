    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'my_method' not in dct:
            dct['my_method'] = lambda self: "Default method"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.my_method())
```

Which of the following statements is true about the behavior of `MyClass` after the metaclass `Meta` has been applied?

A) The class `MyClass` does not have a method named `my_method`.

B) The `my_method` of `MyClass` returns "Default method" when called.

C) The class `MyClass` raises an error if `my_method` is called.

D) The metaclass modifies `MyClass` to require additional parameters during instantiation.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `my_method` of `MyClass` returns "Default method" when called.

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` ensures that every class it creates has a method named `my_method`, even if it is not explicitly defined in the class. In this case, since no `my_method` was defined in `MyClass`, the metaclass adds a default implementation that returns "Default method". Therefore, when an instance of `MyClass` calls `my_method()`, it correctly executes the lambda function provided by the metaclass, returning "Default method".
