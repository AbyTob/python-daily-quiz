    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to modify class attributes dynamically. The goal is to create a decorator that can be applied to classes to prepend "decorated_" to all their string attributes.

```python
class AttributeDecorator(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for key, value in dct.items():
            if isinstance(value, str):
                dct[f'decorated_{key}'] = value
                del dct[key]
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class ExampleClass(metaclass=AttributeDecorator):
    string_attr = "Hello"
    integer_attr = 123

# Decorator function to prepend "decorated_" to all string attributes of a class
def prepend_decorated(cls):
    new_dct = {}
    for attr_name in dir(cls):
        attr_value = getattr(cls, attr_name)
        if isinstance(attr_value, str):
            new_dct[f'decorated_{attr_name}'] = attr_value
        else:
            new_dct[attr_name] = attr_value
    return type(cls.__name__, cls.__bases__, new_dct)

@prepend_decorated
class AnotherExampleClass:
    string_attr = "World"
    integer_attr = 456

print(ExampleClass.string_attr)  # Should print "Hello"
print(ExampleClass.decorated_string_attr)  # Should print "decorated_Hello"

print(AnotherExampleClass.string_attr)  # Should print "World"
print(AnotherExampleClass.decorated_string_attr)  # Should print "decorated_World"

```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior of the `prepend_decorated` decorator and the `AttributeDecorator` metaclass?

A. Both prepend_decorated and AttributeDecorator dynamically modify class attributes by prepending "decorated_" to all string attributes.

B. Only prepend_decorated modifies class attributes, while AttributeDecorator does not change the class at all.

C. The prepend_decorated function correctly decorates classes using a metaclass but fails to properly update the dictionary.

D. Neither prepend_decorated nor AttributeDecorator dynamically modify class attributes; they both leave the original attributes unchanged.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
A. Both prepend_decorated and AttributeDecorator dynamically modify class attributes by prepending "decorated_" to all string attributes.

Explanation:
- The `AttributeDecorator` metaclass correctly modifies class attributes during the class creation process, renaming any string attribute to be prefixed with "decorated_". This is confirmed in the example where `ExampleClass.string_attr` becomes `ExampleClass.decorated_string_attr`.
- The `prepend_decorated` function also dynamically modifies class attributes. It iterates over all attributes of a given class instance, checks if they are strings, and creates new string attributes with "decorated_" prepended to their original names. This is demonstrated in the example where `AnotherExampleClass.string_attr` becomes `AnotherExampleClass.decorated_string_attr`.

Both mechanisms achieve the goal of dynamically modifying class attributes by prepending "decorated_", thus making option A the correct answer.
