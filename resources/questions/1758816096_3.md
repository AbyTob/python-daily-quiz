    ### Question

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to modify class behavior dynamically:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'x' in dct:
            dct['y'] = dct['x'] * 2
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    x = 5

class AnotherClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass
```

What is the output of `print(MyClass.y)` and `print(AnotherClass.y)`?

A) None, None  
B) 10, None  
C) None, 10  
D) 10, 10
    
    ## Answer
    ### Answer

**B) 10, None**

Explanation:
- For `MyClass`, the metaclass `Meta` checks if 'x' is in the dictionary. Since it is (`MyClass.x = 5`), it sets `y` to twice the value of `x`. Therefore, `MyClass.y` is calculated as `10`.
- For `AnotherClass`, there is no attribute `x` defined in its dictionary. The metaclass does not modify the class dictionary since 'x' is absent, so `y` remains undefined and will be `None` when accessed.

This question tests your understanding of how metaclasses can dynamically modify class attributes and handle cases where certain conditions are not met.
