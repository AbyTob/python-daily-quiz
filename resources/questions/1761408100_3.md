# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question): Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Before calling function")
        result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After calling function")
        return result

@AsyncDecorator
async def my_async_function():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Done"

async def main():
    result = await my_async_function()
    print(result)

# Uncomment the following line to run the code
# asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output when `main()` is called? Explain why.

A) Before calling function  
   Done  
   After calling function  

B) Before calling function  
   After calling function  
   Done  

C) Before calling function  
   asyncio.sleep(1)  
   After calling function  

D) Before calling function  
   After calling function  
   asyncio.sleep(1)
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer): A) Before calling function  
   Done  
   After calling function  

Explanation: The `AsyncDecorator` is applied to the `my_async_function`. When `main()` is called, it triggers the execution of `my_async_function` through the decorator. The decorator prints "Before calling function", then waits for `my_async_function` to complete, which itself includes a sleep and returns "Done". After `my_async_function` completes, the decorator prints "After calling function" and returns "Done" as well.
