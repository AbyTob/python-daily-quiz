    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a context manager that measures the execution time of a block of code. The context manager should handle exceptions by logging them as errors instead of allowing them to propagate.

Design a Python context manager named `TimeBlock` that meets these requirements. Your solution should include handling exceptions and logging error messages using Python's built-in `logging` module.
    
    ## Answer
    A) 
```python
import time

class TimeBlock:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - self.start_time} seconds")
```

B) 
```python
import time

class TimeBlock:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        if exc_type:
            print(f"Error: {exc_val}")
        return False  # Propagate exceptions

@contextmanager
def TimeBlock():
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        yield
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    finally:
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

C) 
```python
import time

@contextmanager
def TimeBlock():
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        yield
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    finally:
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

D) 
```python
import time

class TimeBlock:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        if exc_type:
            print(f"Error: {exc_val}")
        return True  # Suppress exceptions
```

The correct answer is C. 

Explanation: The `TimeBlock` context manager should log errors using Python's built-in `logging` module instead of printing them to the console. However, in the provided options, only option C correctly handles exceptions by logging them as errors and then re-raising them for further processing. Option A does not handle exceptions properly, while option B suppresses exceptions without proper error handling. Option D incorrectly returns `True` from the `__exit__` method, which suppresses exceptions instead of allowing them to propagate.
