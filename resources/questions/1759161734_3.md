    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses together:

```python
import time

class TimerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        original_init = dct.get('__init__')
        
        def new_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            if original_init:
                original_init(self, *args, **kwargs)
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f"Initialization took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        
        dct['__init__'] = new_init
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimerMetaClass(metaclass=TimerMeta):
    pass

@timer
class MyClass(TimerMetaClass):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

obj = MyClass(10)
```

Which of the following statements about the code above is true?

A) The `MyClass` class will print "Initialization took X.XXXX seconds" when an instance is created.
B) The `timer` decorator will not affect the execution time of methods in `MyClass`.
C) The metaclass `TimerMeta` and the decorator `timer` will both contribute to measuring the initialization time of `MyClass` instances.
D) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, only the metaclass contributes to measuring the initialization time.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] C) The metaclass `TimerMeta` and the decorator `timer` will both contribute to measuring the initialization time of `MyClass` instances.

Explanation: The `TimerMeta` class is a metaclass that adds timing functionality when an instance of `MyClass` is created. It measures the time taken for the `__init__` method. Additionally, the `@timer` decorator is used on a class method (in this case, implicitly through the decorator's application), which will measure the execution time of any method defined in `MyClass`. Therefore, both the metaclass and the decorator contribute to timing, making option C correct.
