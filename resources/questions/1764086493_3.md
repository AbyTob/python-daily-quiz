    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to ensure that a class has only one instance:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to database")

# Example usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True

db1.connect()  # Output: Connecting to database
```

What will be the output of `db1.connect()` and why?

A) "Connecting to database"  
B) An error indicating multiple instances have been created  
C) No output, because `db1` is not callable  
D) None
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer: A) "Connecting to database"**

Explanation: The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that the `Database` class can only be instantiated once. Therefore, when we create `db2 = Database()`, it returns the same instance as `db1`. When we call `db1.connect()`, it executes the method on the single instance, resulting in the output "Connecting to database".
