    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following code snippet that attempts to implement a thread-safe counter using a decorator:

```python
from functools import wraps
import threading

def thread_safe(func):
    lock = threading.Lock()
    
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        with lock:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    
    return wrapper

@thread_safe
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0
    
    def increment(self):
        self.value += 1
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes a potential issue with this implementation and how to fix it?

A) The use of `wraps` is unnecessary in this context.
B) The lock will be acquired on every method call, which can lead to performance issues. This can be fixed by acquiring the lock only when necessary.
C) The `thread_safe` decorator should be applied at the class level rather than the method level.
D) There is no issue with the current implementation; it properly ensures thread safety.
    
    ## Answer
    D) There is no issue with the current implementation; it properly ensures thread safety.
