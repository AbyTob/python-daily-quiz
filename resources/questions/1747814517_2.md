    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
**Question:** Consider the following Python code that aims to create a simple rate limiter decorator. The goal is to ensure that a function can only be called once every `interval` seconds. However, the implementation has an issue.

```python
import time

def rate_limit(interval):
    def decorator(func):
        last_call_time = 0
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            nonlocal last_call_time
            current_time = time.time()
            if current_time - last_call_time < interval:
                time.sleep(interval - (current_time - last_call_time))
            last_call_time = current_time
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@rate_limit(1)  # Limit to 1 call per second
def my_function():
    print("Function is called")

# Example usage:
my_function()  # Calls the function normally
time.sleep(0.5)
my_function()  # Should wait for 0.5 seconds before calling again
```

Which of the following statements correctly identifies a problem with this implementation?

A) The `rate_limit` decorator does not properly handle the case when multiple instances of `my_function` are called concurrently.

B) The use of a nonlocal variable inside the wrapper function can lead to memory leaks under certain conditions.

C) The sleep time calculation in the wrapper is incorrect, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.

D) The `last_call_time` variable is not thread-safe, which could result in unexpected behavior when called from multiple threads.
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer:** A

**Explanation:** The issue with the provided implementation is that it does not handle concurrent calls correctly. When multiple instances of `my_function` are called concurrently, each call will check the global `last_call_time`, which can lead to all instances waiting for their turn instead of only one instance at a time. This defeats the purpose of rate limiting. The decorator should maintain separate state for each instance or thread if concurrent access is expected.
