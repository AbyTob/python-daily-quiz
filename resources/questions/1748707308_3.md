    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to control class instantiation:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to database...")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # Output: True
```

Which of the following statements correctly explains why `db1` and `db2` are considered equal when compared?

A) Because both `db1` and `db2` are instances of the same class.

B) Due to the use of a metaclass, `SingletonMeta`, which controls how instances are created, ensuring only one instance is ever returned.

C) Because Python's garbage collection automatically handles the instantiation of singleton objects.

D) As both variables reference different memory locations for their respective objects.

**Part 2: Answer**

B) Due to the use of a metaclass, `SingletonMeta`, which controls how instances are created, ensuring only one instance is ever returned.

This question tests the understanding of Python's metaclasses and their ability to customize class behavior. The correct answer highlights that the `SingletonMeta` metaclass overrides the `__call__` method to control the instantiation process, ensuring that each time an instance of `Database` is created, the same pre-existing instance is returned, thus making `db1` and `db2` the same object.
