    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses metaclasses to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(obj1 is obj2)  # True
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created.

B) Metaclasses are not used for creating singletons, so this code will raise an error.

C) The `_instances` dictionary is a class variable and is shared among all instances of `MyClass`.

D) The `SingletonMeta` metaclass inherits from `type`, but it does not override the `__new__` method, which means it cannot create singletons.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created.
