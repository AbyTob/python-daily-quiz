    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass and a decorator together:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@Meta
def my_decorator(cls):
    cls.new_method = lambda self: "Decorator added method"
    return cls

class MyClass(metaclass=my_decorator):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.new_method())
```

What will be the output of this code and why?

A) "Creating class MyClass\nDecorator added method"  
B) Only "Decorator added method"  
C) Error during execution  
D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    **A) "Creating class MyClass\nDecorator added method"**

Explanation: The code defines a metaclass `Meta` that prints a message when creating a class. It also defines a decorator `my_decorator` that adds a new method to any class it decorates. When `MyClass` is defined with `metaclass=my_decorator`, the metaclass `Meta` runs first, printing "Creating class MyClass". Then, the decorator `my_decorator` runs, adding a new method `new_method` to `MyClass`. The output of `obj.new_method()` is therefore "Decorator added method".
