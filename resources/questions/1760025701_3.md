# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_task():
    print("Task started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Task completed")

async def main():
    tasks = [async_task() for _ in range(5)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the output of this program, and what principle does it demonstrate about the behavior of async/await?

A) The output will be "Task started" five times immediately followed by "Task completed" five times. This demonstrates that async functions execute concurrently.

B) The output will be "Task started" once, followed by a pause for 1 second, and then "Task completed". This demonstrates sequential execution.

C) The output will be "Task started" ten times immediately followed by "Task completed" ten times. This demonstrates that the loop creates 10 tasks but only runs one concurrently.

D) The program will raise an exception because asyncio.sleep(1) is not allowed in an async function.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The output will be "Task started" five times immediately followed by "Task completed" five times. This demonstrates that async functions execute concurrently.

The correct answer is A. This question tests the understanding of how async/await works and the principle of concurrent execution in Python's asyncio library. It requires comprehension of the difference between sequential and concurrent programming, as well as an understanding of how `asyncio.sleep()` and other awaitable objects are used to pause the execution of coroutines without blocking the event loop.
