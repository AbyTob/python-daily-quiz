    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

class ThreadSafeSingleton:
    _instances = {}
    _lock = threading.Lock()

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            with cls._lock:
                if cls not in cls._instances:
                    instance = super(ThreadSafeSingleton, cls).__new__(cls)
                    cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Create a singleton instance of ThreadSafeSingleton
singleton1 = ThreadSafeSingleton(42)

def modify_singleton(value):
    global singleton1
    singleton1 = ThreadSafeSingleton(value)

def thread_task():
    print(singleton1.value)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t1 = threading.Thread(target=thread_task)
    t2 = threading.Thread(target=modify_singleton, args=(100,))
    
    t1.start()
    t2.join()  # Wait for t2 to complete
    t1.join()  # Wait for t1 to complete
    
    print(singleton1.value)
```

Which of the following statements about the code is correct?  
A) The output will always be `42` because the singleton ensures that only one instance can exist.  
B) The output could be `42` or `100`, depending on the order in which threads execute.  
C) The output will always be `100` because the thread modifying the singleton happens after `t1` starts and before `t1` completes.  
D) The code will raise a `RecursionError` due to improper use of `__new__`.
