    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators, metaclasses, and async/await together:

```python
# Define a decorator that measures execution time
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Define a metaclass that automatically applies the timing decorator to all methods
class TimeMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = timing_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Define a class using the TimeMeta metaclass
class DataProcessor(metaclass=TimeMeta):
    async def process_data(self, data):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an I/O operation
        return f"Processed: {data}"

# Use the DataProcessor class in an asynchronous context
async def main():
    dp = DataProcessor()
    result = await dp.process_data("sample data")
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the code above?

A) The `DataProcessor` class will execute its methods synchronously.
B) When an instance of `DataProcessor` calls a method, it will automatically print out the execution time.
C) The `timing_decorator` will not affect the `process_data` method because it's an asynchronous method.
D) None of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When an instance of `DataProcessor` calls a method, it will automatically print out the execution time.

Explanation:
- The `timing_decorator` measures the execution time of any callable (methods or functions).
- By using the metaclass `TimeMeta`, we ensure that all methods in the `DataProcessor` class are wrapped with the `timing_decorator`.
- Therefore, when an instance of `DataProcessor` calls a method like `process_data`, it will automatically print out the execution time before returning the result.
- The fact that `process_data` is an asynchronous method does not prevent the decorator from measuring its execution time. The decorator applies to all methods regardless of their async nature.
