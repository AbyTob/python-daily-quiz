    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Usage example
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(obj1 is obj2)  # True or False?
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes what will be printed when the code is executed?

A) `True`  
B) `False`  
C) The program will raise an error because of a circular import.  
D) The output cannot be determined without knowing the implementation details.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) `True`

Explanation: When the `MyClass` is instantiated for the first time, the metaclass's `__call__` method checks if an instance of `MyClass` already exists in `_instances`. Since it does not, a new instance is created and stored in `_instances`. When `MyClass()` is called again, the same instance is returned from `_instances`, hence `obj1 is obj2` evaluates to `True`.
