    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
from functools import wraps

def async_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class AsyncMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith("__"):
                dct[attr_name] = async_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AsyncMeta):
    def method1(self):
        print("Method 1")

    def method2(self):
        print("Method 2")
```

What will be the output of the following code when executed?

```python
obj = MyClass()
asyncio.run(obj.method1())
asyncio.run(obj.method2())
```

Options:
A) Method 1
   Method 2

B) An error, as asyncio is not used correctly.

C) A timeout error, as methods are decorated but not awaited properly.

D) The string representations of method1 and method2

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Method 1  
Method 2

**Explanation:**

The question tests the candidate's understanding of metaclasses, decorators, and asyncio. 

- The `AsyncMeta` metaclass is defined to automatically apply a decorator (`async_decorator`) to any callable attribute in the class it creates.
- The `async_decorator` does not actually make the method asynchronous; instead, it wraps the method without altering its behavior (it simply returns whatever the method returns).
- When an instance of `MyClass` is created, both `method1` and `method2` are decorated by `async_decorator`, which means they will behave as normal methods when called.
- Therefore, calling `obj.method1()` and `obj.method2()` will print "Method 1" and "Method 2", respectively.
