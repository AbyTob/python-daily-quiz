    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Data fetched"

async def process_data(data):
    print(f"Processing {data}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Processed {data}"

async def main():
    data = await fetch_data()
    processed_data = await process_data(data)
    print(processed_data)

# Run the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `fetch_data` function will always complete before the `process_data` function.
B) Both `fetch_data` and `process_data` functions run in parallel.
C) The program waits for 2 seconds before processing any data.
D) The `asyncio.run(main())` call runs all tasks synchronously.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `fetch_data` function will always complete before the `process_data` function.

Explanation: In Python's asyncio, the code does not run in parallel by default. Each coroutine must explicitly wait for another task to complete using an `await` statement. Therefore, `fetch_data` will need to complete its 2-second sleep before `process_data` can start processing any data, making option A true. Option B is incorrect because the coroutines are not running concurrently. Options C and D are also incorrect as there is no guarantee that the program waits for 2 seconds or runs tasks synchronously; it follows an event loop where tasks yield control back to the event loop when waiting.
