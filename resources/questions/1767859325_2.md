    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code:

```python
import asyncio

async def task(name):
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Task {name} running: {i}")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    tasks = []
    for i in range(3):
        tasks.append(asyncio.create_task(task(f'Task-{i+1}')))
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `task` function will run concurrently, but not necessarily in parallel.
B) Each task will run on a separate thread.
C) The `asyncio.gather` function guarantees that tasks are executed sequentially.
D) The program will block until all tasks are completed.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `task` function will run concurrently, but not necessarily in parallel.

Explanation:
The given code demonstrates the use of asynchronous functions and the `asyncio` library to manage concurrency. The `asyncio.create_task` function schedules a coroutine object to run soon, which means that tasks are scheduled for concurrent execution within an event loop. However, whether they run truly concurrently or only appear to do so depends on the underlying operating system's thread management capabilities. In many cases, due to Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), true parallel execution of CPU-bound tasks is not possible. Therefore, while tasks will run concurrently (i.e., they won't block each other waiting for I/O operations), they may not run in full parallel. Option A accurately reflects this behavior.

Option B is incorrect because `asyncio` manages its own event loop and does not explicitly use threads by default.
Option C is also incorrect; `asyncio.gather` collects results from all tasks as they complete, but it does not guarantee sequential execution.
Option D is incorrect since the program will indeed block until all tasks are completed.
