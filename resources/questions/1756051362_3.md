**Question:**
You are tasked with creating a class that manages resources asynchronously. The class should allow for the execution of asynchronous tasks within its methods, ensuring that each task runs in a separate coroutine. Additionally, it should support context management to ensure proper resource handling.

Here is a partial implementation:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncResourceManager:
    def __init__(self, resources):
        self.resources = resources

    async def acquire(self):
        # Implement acquiring resources asynchronously
        pass

    async def release(self):
        # Implement releasing resources asynchronously
        pass

    async def execute(self, task_func):
        await self.acquire()
        try:
            result = await task_func()
        finally:
            await self.release()
        return result

# Example usage
async def sample_task():
    print("Task started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Task completed")
    return "Result"

async def main():
    manager = AsyncResourceManager(["Resource1", "Resource2"])
    result = await manager.execute(sample_task)
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following options correctly completes the `AsyncResourceManager` class to meet the requirements?

A) 
```python
async def acquire(self):
    self.resources[0] += "_acquired"

async def release(self):
    self.resources[1] += "_released"
```

B)
```python
async def acquire(self):
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate async operation

async def release(self):
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)  # Simulate async operation
```

C)
```python
async def acquire(self):
    for resource in self.resources:
        print(f"Acquiring {resource}")

async def release(self):
    for resource in reversed(self.resources):
        print(f"Releasing {resource}")
```

D)
```python
async def acquire(self):
    await asyncio.gather(*[self._acquire(resource) for resource in self.resources])

async def release(self):
    await asyncio.gather(*[self._release(resource) for resource in reversed(self.resources)])

async def _acquire(self, resource):
    # Simulate async acquisition
    pass

async def _release(self, resource):
    # Simulate async release
    pass
```

**Options:**
A) Acquiring and releasing resources immediately without any actual async behavior.
B) Correctly simulating async operations for acquiring and releasing resources but not handling the context properly.
C) Properly logging the acquisition and release of resources sequentially.
D) Implementing true asynchronous resource management with tasks running in separate coroutines.

[ANSWER_SEPARATOR]
**Answer:**
**D)**

Explanation:
Option D correctly implements true asynchronous resource management. It uses `asyncio.gather` to run `_acquire` and `_release` methods concurrently for each resource, ensuring that the entire operation is asynchronous and efficient. This setup allows tasks within the `execute` method to run in separate coroutines, adhering to the requirement of executing them asynchronously. Additionally, it properly handles context management by acquiring resources before task execution and releasing them afterward.
