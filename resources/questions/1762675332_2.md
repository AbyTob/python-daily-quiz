    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching data from {url}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def main():
    urls = ["http://example.com", "http://test.com", "http://sample.com"]
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `fetch_data` function will be executed sequentially.
B) All three calls to `fetch_data` are made simultaneously, and their results are gathered in order.
C) The execution time of this script will be more than 3 seconds because all tasks must wait for each other.
D) This script will not run due to an error.
    
    ## Answer
    [B] The async functions within the loop `tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]` are scheduled concurrently by the event loop. Thus, `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` runs them all at the same time and waits for all of them to complete before gathering their results. Since each fetch takes 1 second, the total execution time will be approximately 1 second, not more than 3 seconds.

**Explanation**:
The asyncio library is designed for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives. In this example, `fetch_data` is an async function that simulates fetching data from a URL with a 1-second delay. When you create multiple tasks for the same async function by iterating over a list of URLs and then use `asyncio.gather`, these tasks run concurrently. The gather function waits for all tasks to complete before returning their results, which in this case is the data fetched from each URL. Therefore, the total time taken to fetch data from all three URLs will be approximately 1 second, not more than 3 seconds as stated in option C.

The code does not have any errors that would prevent it from running, making options A and D incorrect. Option B accurately describes the behavior of the script given its use of asyncio and concurrent task execution.
