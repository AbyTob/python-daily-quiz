    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that attempts to create a metaclass which counts the number of instances created by any class it decorates:

```python
class InstanceCounter(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        cls._instance_count = 0
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        cls._instance_count += 1
        return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceCounter):
    pass

obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(MyClass._instance_count)
```

What will be the output of this code when run?

A) 0  
B) 1  
C) 2  
D) TypeError
    
    ## Answer
    C) 2  

The metaclass `InstanceCounter` increments a class attribute `_instance_count` each time an instance of any class that uses it is created. Since two instances of `MyClass` are created (`obj1` and `obj2`), the output will be 2.
