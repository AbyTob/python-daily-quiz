    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

def create_instance():
    obj1 = MyClass()
    obj2 = MyClass()
    return obj1 is obj2

# What will be the result of calling `create_instance()`?
A) True
B) False
C) TypeError
D) SyntaxError
    
    ## Answer
    A) True

Explanation: 
The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can ever be created. When you call `create_instance()`, it attempts to create two instances of `MyClass`. Due to the singleton pattern enforced by the metaclass, both `obj1` and `obj2` will refer to the same object in memory, making the comparison `obj1 is obj2` evaluate to `True`.
