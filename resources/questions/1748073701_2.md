    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure all instances of a class have a unique identifier:

```python
class UniqueIDMeta(type):
    _instance_id = 0
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        instance.id = cls._instance_id
        cls._instance_id += 1
        return instance

class MyClass(metaclass=UniqueIDMeta):
    pass

# Creating instances of MyClass
a = MyClass()
b = MyClass()

print(a.id)  # Output: ?
print(b.id)  # Output: ?
```

Which of the following statements is true about the output when running this code?

A) a.id will be 0 and b.id will be 1  
B) a.id will be 1 and b.id will be 2  
C) Both instances will have the same id, which is undefined  
D) An error will occur because metaclasses cannot assign attributes to instances
    
    ## Answer
    A) a.id will be 0 and b.id will be 1

Explanation: The `UniqueIDMeta` metaclass uses a class-level variable `_instance_id` to keep track of the number of instances created. When an instance is created, it assigns the current value of `_instance_id` as its id and then increments `_instance_id`. Therefore, when `a = MyClass()` is executed, `a.id` is set to 0, and when `b = MyClass()` is executed, `b.id` is set to 1.
