    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, label):
        self.label = label
    
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        elapsed_time = time.time() - self.start_time
        print(f"{self.label}: {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")

def timed_function():
    with Timer("Function Execution"):
        for i in range(1000000):
            pass

timed_function()
```

This code defines a context manager `Timer` that measures and prints the execution time of any block of code it wraps. When `timed_function()` is called, it runs a loop for 1 million iterations inside the `with` statement.

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `__exit__` method will never be called if an exception occurs within the `with` block.
B) The `Timer` class can be used as both a decorator and a context manager.
C) The `Timer` class cannot be subclassed to add new functionality.
D) The `Timer` class uses Python's garbage collector to manage its resources.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `Timer` class can be used as both a decorator and a context manager.

Explanation:
The provided code snippet demonstrates the use of a context manager. However, it does not provide any indication that this class could also be used as a decorator. Decorators are typically implemented using functions or classes that wrap another function or method, while context managers are used with `with` statements to manage resources like file handles or timers.

For a class to be usable both as a context manager and a decorator, it would need separate methods for these purposes, which is not the case here. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.

Statement A is also incorrect because if an exception occurs within the `with` block, the `__exit__` method will still be called to handle any cleanup or error handling as specified in the context manager protocol.

Option C is incorrect because a class can always be subclassed to add new functionality. The `Timer` class could be extended with additional methods or attributes without breaking its basic functionality.

Statement D is also incorrect as the `Timer` class does not rely on Python's garbage collector for managing its resources. Instead, it manages resources explicitly by using methods like `__enter__` and `__exit__`, which are part of the context management protocol.
