    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure all instances of a class have a unique identifier:

```python
import uuid

class UniqueIdMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class UniqueInstance(metaclass=UniqueIdMeta):
    pass

# Usage
a = UniqueInstance()
b = UniqueInstance()

print(a is b)  # Output: True
```

What will be the output of `print(a is b)`? Why?

A. False  
B. True  
C. Raises an error  
D. Outputs None
    
    ## Answer
    B. True

The metaclass `UniqueIdMeta` ensures that any class using it (`UniqueInstance` in this case) can only have one instance, stored and returned from a dictionary `_instances`. Therefore, when both `a` and `b` are created as instances of `UniqueInstance`, they point to the same object, resulting in `a is b` evaluating to True.
