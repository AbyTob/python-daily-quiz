# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncWorker:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    async def work(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is working")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print(f"{self.name} has finished")

async def main():
    worker1 = AsyncWorker("Alice")
    worker2 = AsyncWorker("Bob")
    
    tasks = [worker1.work(), worker2.work()]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    asyncio.run(main())
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total time taken: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the execution time of this script?

A) The script will take approximately 2 seconds to run.
B) The script will take approximately 1 second to run.
C) The script will take longer than 2 seconds to run due to GIL restrictions.
D) The script will raise a `RuntimeError` because `asyncio.run(main())` is called from within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
B) The script will take approximately 1 second to run.

Explanation:
The `asyncio.sleep(1)` call in the `work` method of the `AsyncWorker` class simulates a blocking I/O operation. When this coroutine is called within an asyncio event loop, it does not block the execution of other coroutines. Instead, it allows other tasks to run while waiting for the sleep to complete. Therefore, both "Alice" and "Bob" will be working concurrently, reducing the total time taken to approximately 1 second. This demonstrates the non-blocking nature of asynchronous programming with asyncio.
