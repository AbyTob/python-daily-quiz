    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval
        self.running = False

    async def start(self):
        while self.running:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
            print("Time's up!")

async def main():
    timer = AsyncTimer(1)
    timer.running = True
    task = asyncio.create_task(timer.start())
    await asyncio.sleep(3)
    timer.running = False
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `AsyncTimer` class can only be used to measure time intervals without stopping.
B) The `main` function will raise a `RuntimeError` because it tries to stop an asynchronous task after it has already completed.
C) The `asyncio.sleep(3)` in the `main` function ensures that the timer runs for exactly 3 seconds.
D) When the `timer.running` flag is set to `False`, the `start` method stops executing immediately.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
B) The `main` function will raise a `RuntimeError` because it tries to stop an asynchronous task after it has already completed.

Explanation: In Python, once an asyncio Task has been awaited and completed, it cannot be stopped. Setting the `running` flag to `False` in this case does not affect the running task created by `asyncio.create_task(timer.start())`. Therefore, when the timer is supposed to stop after 3 seconds, attempting to set `timer.running` to `False` does nothing and the program will raise a `RuntimeError` when it tries to await the already completed task.
