    ## Answer
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a metaclass to automatically add a method `log_access` to any class it decorates:

```python
class AccessLoggerMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'log_access' not in dct:
            def log_access(self):
                print(f"Accessing {self.__class__.__name__}")
        dct['log_access'] = log_access
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class DataHandler(metaclass=AccessLoggerMeta):
    def process_data(self):
        pass

dh = DataHandler()
dh.process_data()  # This will trigger the log_access method
```

Which of the following statements about the `DataHandler` class is true?

A) The `log_access` method is added to every subclass of `DataHandler`.
B) When an instance of `DataHandler` calls any method, it automatically logs access.
C) The `log_access` method is added only if it does not already exist in the class dictionary.
D) All instances of `DataHandler` share the same `log_access` method.

Part 2 (Answer):
C) The `log_access` method is added only if it does not already exist in the class dictionary.

Explanation: The metaclass `AccessLoggerMeta` checks if the `log_access` method exists in the dictionary being created for the new class. If it does not, it defines a new `log_access` method that prints a message indicating access to the class. This ensures that `log_access` is added only if it's not already defined, preventing any potential conflicts with existing methods or attributes.
