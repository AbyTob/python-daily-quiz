    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet which uses both metaclasses and class decorators:

```python
def my_decorator(cls):
    original_new = cls.__new__

    def new_new(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Decorator is called")
        return original_new(cls, *args, **kwargs)

    cls.__new__ = new_new
    return cls

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'x' in dct:
            print(f"Metaclass added attribute: {dct['x']}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@my_decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    x = 5

    def __init__(self, y):
        self.y = y

# Create an instance of MyClass
obj = MyClass(10)
```

What will be the output when running this code? 

A) Decorator is called  
B) Metaclass added attribute: 5  
C) Both A and B  
D) Neither A nor B
    
    ## Answer
    C) Both A and B  

Explanation:
- The `my_decorator` function modifies the `__new__` method of the class to print "Decorator is called" whenever an instance of `MyClass` is created.
- The metaclass `Meta` checks if the dictionary `dct` contains a key 'x'. If it does, it prints a message indicating that it added the attribute. In this case, since `MyClass` has an attribute `x = 5`, the metaclass will print "Metaclass added attribute: 5".
- When creating an instance of `MyClass`, both the decorator and the metaclass are invoked, hence both messages will be printed in the given order.
