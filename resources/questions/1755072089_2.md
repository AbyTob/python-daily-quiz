    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Data fetched"

class AsyncCache:
    _cache = {}

    @classmethod
    async def get(cls, key):
        if key not in cls._cache:
            cls._cache[key] = await fetch_data()
        return cls._cache[key]

async def main():
    data1 = await AsyncCache.get("data1")
    print(f"Data 1: {data1}")
    data2 = await AsyncCache.get("data1")
    print(f"Data 2: {data2}")

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following best describes what happens in this code?

A) The `fetch_data` function is called twice, and each time it takes 2 seconds to execute.
B) The `fetch_data` function is only called once, and the result is cached for subsequent calls.
C) The code raises an exception because the `_cache` attribute is not properly initialized as a class variable.
D) The code does not run at all because of an error in the usage of the `async/await` syntax.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `fetch_data` function is only called once, and the result is cached for subsequent calls.
