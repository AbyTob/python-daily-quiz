    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a combination of decorators, metaclasses, and asynchronous programming:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        async def wrapper():
            print(f"Initializing {name}")
            for func in dct.values():
                if callable(func) and not func.__name__.startswith("__"):
                    await func()
        dct['init_coro'] = staticmethod(wrapper)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AsyncClass(metaclass=AsyncMeta):
    def async_method1(self):
        print("Executing async_method1")
    
    async def async_method2(self):
        print("Executing async_method2")

async def main():
    obj = AsyncClass()
    await obj.init_coro()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `AsyncMeta` metaclass does not affect how instances of `AsyncClass` are created.

B) When an instance of `AsyncClass` is created, it automatically executes all asynchronous methods defined within it.

C) The `init_coro` method is called on the class itself, initializing all asynchronous methods when the class is instantiated.

D) The `async_method1` and `async_method2` are executed sequentially in the order they appear.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When an instance of `AsyncClass` is created, it automatically executes all asynchronous methods defined within it.

Explanation:
- The `AsyncMeta` metaclass dynamically adds a static method `init_coro` to the class. This method, when called, iterates over all callable attributes (excluding special methods like `__init__`) and awaits their execution.
- When an instance of `AsyncClass` is created, `init_coro` is not automatically executed because it is a class-level method, not an instance method.
- To execute the asynchronous methods, one must manually call the `init_coro` method on the class or instantiate the class and then call `init_coro`.

This question tests the ability to understand the interactions between metaclasses, decorators, and asynchronous programming in Python. It requires a deep understanding of how these components work together and their roles during object creation and initialization.
