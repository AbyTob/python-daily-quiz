    [QUESTION]
**Question:** Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to modify class attributes dynamically. The metaclass is designed to add an attribute `extra_info` with a default value of "Unknown" if it doesn't already exist.

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'extra_info' not in dct:
            dct['extra_info'] = 'Unknown'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    extra_info = "Specific Info"

# Create instances of the classes
base_instance = BaseClass()
derived_instance = DerivedClass()

print(base_instance.extra_info)  # Output: ?
print(derived_instance.extra_info)  # Output: ?
```

What will be the output of this code snippet?

A. `Unknown` and `Specific Info`
B. `None` and `Specific Info`
C. `Unknown` and `Unknown`
D. Error
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer:** A. `Unknown` and `Specific Info`

**Explanation:** The metaclass `Meta` checks if the attribute `extra_info` exists in the class dictionary when a new class is created. If it doesn't, it adds this attribute with a default value of "Unknown". When we define `DerivedClass`, it explicitly sets `extra_info` to "Specific Info", so the metaclass does not overwrite it. Thus, `base_instance.extra_info` will be set by the metaclass and will be "Unknown", while `derived_instance.extra_info` is set in the class definition and will be "Specific Info".
