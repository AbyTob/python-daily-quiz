    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses metaclasses to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class DatabaseConnection(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to database...")

# Usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

db1.connect()  # Output: Connecting to database...
db2.connect()  # Output should be different if not a singleton
```

Which of the following statements is true about the `DatabaseConnection` class when using the provided metaclass?

A) Multiple instances of `DatabaseConnection` can exist at runtime.
B) The `connect` method will only print "Connecting to database..." once, no matter how many times it's called on different instances.
C) The `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` is not used when creating an instance of `DatabaseConnection`.
D) Accessing `db2.connect()` will raise a TypeError because the class is not callable.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `connect` method will only print "Connecting to database..." once, no matter how many times it's called on different instances.

Explanation: The `SingletonMeta` metaclass ensures that only one instance of `DatabaseConnection` can exist at runtime. When `db1` and `db2` are created, they refer to the same object, so calling `connect` on either will execute the print statement only once.
