    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
**Question:**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses metaclasses and class decoration:

```python
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'my_method' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Class does not define my_method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@MyMeta
class MyClass:
    def my_method(self):
        print("Method is called")

try:
    class MySubClass(MyClass):
        pass  # Intentionally left empty to trigger an error
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```

What will be the output of this code? Why?

A) `TypeError: Class does not define my_method`  
B) `Method is called`  
C) `No output`  
D) `RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer:** A) `TypeError: Class does not define my_method`  

**Explanation:**

The code defines a metaclass `MyMeta` that checks if the class it's creating has a method named `my_method`. If this method is not present, the metaclass raises a `TypeError`.

In the case of `MySubClass`, it inherits from `MyClass` but intentionally does not define its own `my_method`. This causes the metaclass to fail during the creation of `MySubClass` because it doesn't find the required `my_method` in either `MySubClass` or any of its base classes. As a result, a `TypeError` is raised with the message "Class does not define my_method".
