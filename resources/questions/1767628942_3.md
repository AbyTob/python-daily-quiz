# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator and a metaclass:

```python
# Define a simple decorator
def add_prefix(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Prefix")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

# Define a metaclass that applies the decorator to methods of a class
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name in dct:
            if callable(dct[attr_name]):
                dct[attr_name] = add_prefix(dct[attr_name])
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Create a class using the metaclass
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def method1(self):
        print("Method 1")

    def method2(self):
        print("Method 2")
```

What will be printed to the console when an instance of `MyClass` calls its methods? Explain why this happens.

A) Only "Prefix" will be printed, as the decorator applies to all methods.

B) Both "Prefix" and "Method X" (where X is method1 or method2) will be printed for each method call.

C) "Method 1" and "Method 2" will be printed without any prefix.

D) An error will occur because decorators cannot be used with metaclasses in this way.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
B) Both "Prefix" and "Method X" (where X is method1 or method2) will be printed for each method call.

Explanation:
In the provided code, `Meta` is a metaclass that iterates through all attributes of any class it is applied to. If an attribute is callable (i.e., a method), the decorator `add_prefix` is applied to that method. When an instance of `MyClass` calls its methods, the decorated version of these methods is invoked, which first prints "Prefix" and then proceeds with the original method's logic. This results in both "Prefix" and the method name being printed each time a method is called.
