    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a combination of metaclasses, decorators, and context managers:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'abstract_methods' in dct:
            for method_name in dct['abstract_methods']:
                if not callable(dct.get(method_name)):
                    raise TypeError(f"{method_name} must be a method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(metaclass=BaseMeta):
    abstract_methods = ['start', 'stop']

@BaseClass.register
class MyService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.running = False

    async def start(self):
        if not self.running:
            self.running = True
            print("Service started")
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("Service is already running")

    async def stop(self):
        if self.running:
            self.running = False
            print("Service stopped")
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("Service is not running")

    async def check_status(self):
        if self.running:
            return "Running"
        else:
            return "Stopped"

class ServiceManager:
    def __init__(self, service_class):
        self.service = service_class()

    async def manage_service(self):
        await self.service.start()
        status = await self.service.check_status()
        print(f"Current Status: {status}")
        await self.service.stop()
        status = await self.service.check_status()
        print(f"Final Status: {status}")

# Usage
async def main():
    manager = ServiceManager(MyService)
    await manager.manage_service()

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this code when executed? Explain each step in detail.

A) 
```
Service started
Current Status: Running
Service stopped
Final Status: Stopped
```

B) 
```
Service started
Current Status: Running
RuntimeError: Service is not running
```

C)
```
RuntimeError: Service is already running
Current Status: Running
Service stopped
Final Status: Stopped
```

D)
```
Service started
Current Status: Running
Final Status: Stopped
RuntimeError: Service is already running
``)

[ANSWER]
A) 
```
Service started
Current Status: Running
Service stopped
Final Status: Stopped
```

Explanation:
1. When `ServiceManager` is instantiated with `MyService`, the `__init__` method of `ServiceManager` creates an instance of `MyService`.
2. The `manage_service` coroutine in `ServiceManager` calls the `start` method on `self.service`. Since `MyService` implements a non-blocking `start` method, it successfully sets `self.running` to `True` and prints "Service started".
3. It then calls `check_status`, which returns "Running" because `self.running` is `True`.
4. After that, it calls the `stop` method on `self.service`. This method sets `self.running` back to `False` and prints "Service stopped".
5. Finally, it checks the status again with `check_status`, which now returns "Stopped" as `self.running` is `False`.

The correct output matches option A.
