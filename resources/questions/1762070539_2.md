    ## Question
    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses:

```python
from functools import wraps

def log_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args {args} and kwargs {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if '__call__' in dct:
            dct['__call__'] = log_decorator(dct['__call__'])
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __call__(self, new_value):
        self.value += new_value
        return self.value

# Usage:
obj = MyClass(10)
print(obj(5))  # Output: Calling __call__ with args (5,) and kwargs {}
                #         __call__ returned 15
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `log_decorator` will not log any information when an instance of `MyClass` is created.

B) The `Meta` metaclass modifies the `__init__` method to include logging.

C) When `obj(5)` is called, the output will be "15" without any additional logging.

D) The use of `type` as a metaclass automatically applies the `log_decorator` to all methods in the class.

**Part 2: Answer**

A) This statement is false. Since `__call__` is being decorated with `log_decorator`, it will log its calls and return values.

B) This statement is false. The `Meta` metaclass does not modify the `__init__` method, but it modifies the `__call__` method.

C) This statement is false. While the output of `obj(5)` will be "15", there will also be additional logging printed due to the use of `log_decorator`.

D) This statement is false. The metaclass `Meta` explicitly checks if `__call__` exists in the class dictionary and decorates it, not all methods.

The correct answer is none of the above, indicating that the code snippet provided does not meet the conditions described in options A through D.
