    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to control class creation:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'abstract' in dct:
            del dct['abstract']
            return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"{name} must be an abstract class")

class Animal(ABC, metaclass=Meta):
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof!")

try:
    cat = Animal()
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

What will be the output of this code when run?

A) "Woof!"  
B) TypeError: Animal must be an abstract class  
C) RuntimeWarning: implicit call to '__init__' in a collection  
D) SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is B) TypeError: Animal must be an abstract class.

Explanation:
In the provided code, the `Meta` metaclass is used to ensure that any subclass of `Animal` must explicitly declare itself as an abstract class by including the key 'abstract' in its dictionary. Since `Animal` does not declare itself as an abstract class and inherits from `ABC`, the metaclass raises a `TypeError` indicating that `Animal` must be an abstract class.
