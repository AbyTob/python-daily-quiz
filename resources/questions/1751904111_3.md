    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question): 
Consider the following Python code using asyncio and decorators to create a simple task manager. Your task is to identify what will be printed when `run_tasks()` is called.

```python
import asyncio

def timed_task(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Task {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timed_task
async def task1():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)

@timed_task
async def task2():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def run_tasks():
    tasks = [task1(), task2()]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import time
    asyncio.run(run_tasks())
```

A) Task 1 took 0.0000 seconds, Task 2 took 3.0000 seconds  
B) Task 1 took 2.0000 seconds, Task 2 took 1.0000 seconds  
C) Task 1 took 3.0000 seconds, Task 2 took 2.0000 seconds  
D) Task 1 took 2.0000 seconds, Task 2 took 0.0000 seconds
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
B) Task 1 took 2.0000 seconds, Task 2 took 1.0000 seconds  

Explanation: The `timed_task` decorator is applied to both `task1` and `task2`, which measure the execution time of their respective tasks. Since `task1` sleeps for 2 seconds and `task2` sleeps for 1 second, the output reflects these durations accurately.
