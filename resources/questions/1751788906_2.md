    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

# Example usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Should print True
```

Which of the following statements about this code is **NOT** true?

A) The `__call__` method in `SingletonMeta` ensures that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created.

B) Metaclasses allow for custom behavior during class creation, which is used here to enforce the singleton pattern.

C) Using a metaclass for this purpose is considered an antipattern and should always be avoided in favor of simpler design patterns.

D) The `_instances` dictionary stores instances of classes, and this code could be generalized to handle multiple classes using the same metaclass.
    
    ## Answer
    C) Using a metaclass for this purpose is considered an antipattern and should always be avoided in favor of simpler design patterns.

**Explanation:** While metaclasses are a powerful feature in Python, they can also lead to code that is harder to understand and maintain. In the context of the singleton pattern, using a class decorator or simply overriding the `__new__` method of the class itself might be more straightforward and intuitive for many developers. Additionally, this approach uses a dictionary at the metaclass level which could be problematic if not managed carefully in terms of garbage collection and potential memory leaks.
