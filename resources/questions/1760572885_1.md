    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to dynamically create classes based on a template class:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        new_class = super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        new_class.custom_attr = "Custom Attribute"
        return new_class

class BaseClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    pass
```

What will be the output when you print `DerivedClass.custom_attr`?

A) AttributeError: 'DerivedClass' object has no attribute 'custom_attr'
B) None
C) "Custom Attribute"
D) TypeError: __new__() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
    
    ## Answer
    C) "Custom Attribute"

Explanation:
The metaclass `Meta` is defined to add a custom attribute `custom_attr` to any class it creates. When `DerivedClass` is created, the `__new__` method of `Meta` is called with the arguments `(cls, 'DerivedClass', (BaseClass,), {})`. This adds `custom_attr` to the `DerivedClass`, which can then be accessed as shown in the question.
