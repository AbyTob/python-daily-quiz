    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that aims to implement a simple logging system with context management. However, it contains an error that prevents it from working as intended.

```python
class Log:
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message

    async def __aenter__(self):
        print(f"Entering log: {self.message}")
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        if exc_type is None:
            print(f"Exiting log without error: {self.message}")
        else:
            print(f"Exiting log with error: {exc_value}")

async def test_log():
    async with Log("Test"):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        raise ValueError("Test error")

import asyncio
asyncio.run(test_log())
```

What is the issue with this code, and how can it be fixed to correctly handle asynchronous operations within a context manager?

A) The `__aenter__` method should not be declared as `async`.
B) The `__aexit__` method should not raise an exception if one occurred.
C) The `test_log` function is not properly awaited.
D) The use of `async with` is incorrect and should be replaced with a regular `with`.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
A) The `__aenter__` method should not be declared as `async`.

**Explanation**: The issue lies in the declaration of the `__aenter__` method. Although it is intended to perform an asynchronous operation (printing), it should be implemented without the `async` keyword because it does not return a coroutine object. Instead, it returns `None`, which is the default behavior and correct for context managers that do not need to return anything.

To fix this issue, simply remove the `async` keyword from the `__aenter__` method:

```python
class Log:
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message

    def __aenter__(self):
        print(f"Entering log: {self.message}")
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        if exc_type is None:
            print(f"Exiting log without error: {self.message}")
        else:
            print(f"Exiting log with error: {exc_value}")

async def test_log():
    async with Log("Test"):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        raise ValueError("Test error")

import asyncio
asyncio.run(test_log())
```

Now, the context manager will work as intended, printing "Entering log: Test", waiting for 1 second, and then printing "Exiting log with error: Test error".
