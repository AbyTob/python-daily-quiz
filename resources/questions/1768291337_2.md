    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class. A singleton is a design pattern where a class can have only one instance, and that single instance is accessed from a global point of access.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super(SingletonMeta, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Usage
singleton1 = Singleton(10)
singleton2 = Singleton(20)

print(singleton1.value)  # Output: ?
print(singleton2.value)  # Output: ?
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior of `singleton1` and `singleton2`?

A) Both `singleton1` and `singleton2` will have a value of 10.
B) Both `singleton1` and `singleton2` will have a value of 20.
C) Only `singleton1` will have a value of 10, and `singleton2` will be None.
D) The code will raise an error because a singleton cannot be instantiated with different values.
    
    ## Answer
    A) Both `singleton1` and `singleton2` will have a value of 10.

**Explanation:** In the given implementation of the Singleton pattern using a metaclass, all instances are stored in `_instances`. When an instance is created for the first time (e.g., `Singleton(10)`), it gets added to `_instances`. If another instance is created later (e.g., `Singleton(20)`), instead of creating a new instance, it returns the already existing instance from `_instances`. Therefore, both `singleton1` and `singleton2` refer to the same object, which has the value set during its first instantiation (`10`). Thus, both print statements output `10`.
