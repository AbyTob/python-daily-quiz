    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, delay):
        self.delay = delay

    async def __aenter__(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(self.delay)
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Timer finished")

async def main():
    async with AsyncTimer(2) as timer:
        print("Timer started")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

# Uncomment the following line to run the code
# asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be printed when you uncomment and run the `main()` function? Explain why.

A) "Timer started"  
B) "Timer finished"  
C) "Timer started\nTimer finished"  
D) The program will hang

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**Answer:** C) "Timer started\nTimer finished"

**Explanation:**
The provided code defines an `AsyncTimer` class that implements both the `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods, making it a context manager. When used with the `async with` statement in the `main()` function, the flow of execution works as follows:

1. The `async with` statement first calls the `__aenter__` method of the `AsyncTimer` instance.
2. Inside `__aenter__`, the program awaits a sleep for 2 seconds using `await asyncio.sleep(self.delay)`.
3. After the sleep is complete, "Timer started" is printed.
4. Control then transfers to the next line after the `async with` block.
5. The `async with` statement next calls the `__aexit__` method of the `AsyncTimer` instance.
6. Inside `__aexit__`, it prints "Timer finished".

Thus, both "Timer started" and "Timer finished" are printed in that order.
