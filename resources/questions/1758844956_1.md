    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a high-performance web server that handles multiple concurrent requests. The server needs to be able to serve static files efficiently while also processing dynamic content asynchronously.

To achieve this, you decide to use a combination of Python's `asyncio` and `aiofiles` libraries for handling asynchronous file operations. You want to create a custom context manager that can manage both synchronous and asynchronous file opening and closing operations seamlessly.

Here is a partial implementation of the custom context manager:

```python
import asyncio
import aiofiles

class AsyncFileContextManager:
    def __init__(self, path, mode='r'):
        self.path = path
        self.mode = mode
        self.file = None

    async def __aenter__(self):
        # This method should open the file asynchronously if in async context
        pass

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        # This method should close the file appropriately
        if self.file:
            await self.file.close()

    def __enter__(self):
        # This method should handle synchronous file opening if not in async context
        pass

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        # This method should handle synchronous file closing if not in async context
        pass
```

You need to complete the implementation of the `AsyncFileContextManager` class so that it can handle both synchronous and asynchronous contexts seamlessly.

Which of the following options correctly implements the `__aenter__`, `__exit__`, `__enter__`, and `__exit__` methods to achieve the desired functionality?

A) Implement a method `is_async_context()` to check if the current context is asynchronous, then open/close files accordingly.

B) Use Python's built-in `contextmanager` decorator from the `contextlib` module to simplify the implementation.

C) Manually check for an asynchronous context using `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` and conditionally call synchronous or asynchronous methods.

D) Implement both asynchronous and synchronous file opening/closing operations within each method, assuming that the context manager can only be used in one mode at a time.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
A) Implement a method `is_async_context()` to check if the current context is asynchronous, then open/close files accordingly.

**Explanation:** The correct approach involves checking whether the current execution context is synchronous or asynchronous. This can typically be done by trying to run an asynchronous function and catching any resulting exceptions. If an exception is caught, it indicates that the code is running in a synchronous context, allowing the synchronous file handling methods to be called. Conversely, if no exceptions are caught, the code is running asynchronously, allowing the asynchronous file handling methods to be called.

Option A correctly implements this logic by introducing an `is_async_context()` method to determine the current context and then appropriately opening or closing files based on whether the context is synchronous or asynchronous.
