    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

async def task(name, delay):
    print(f"Task {name} started")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Task {name} finished")

async def main():
    tasks = [task(i, i) for i in range(5)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    asyncio.run(main())
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total execution time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

Which of the following statements best describes how this code behaves and what it will output?

A) The tasks will run concurrently, completing in around 0.5 seconds.
B) The tasks will run sequentially, completing in around 12.5 seconds.
C) The tasks will run concurrently, but the total execution time will be more than 4 seconds due to printing overhead.
D) The code will raise an exception because tasks are not defined correctly.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The tasks will run concurrently, completing in around 0.5 seconds.

Explanation: In this example, `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` is used, which schedules all the tasks to run concurrently. Since each task sleeps for a time equal to its index, the total execution time will be dominated by the longest-running task (the one with the highest index). Therefore, the total execution time will be close to 4 seconds (since task 4 takes the most time).
