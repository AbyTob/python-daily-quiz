    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        return loop.run_until_complete(self.func(*args, **kwargs))

@AsyncDecorator
async def fetch_data(url):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def main():
    result = fetch_data("https://example.com")
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What is the primary issue with this code, and how would you correct it to ensure that `fetch_data` runs asynchronously as intended?

A) The `AsyncDecorator` should use `async def` instead of `def`.
B) The `AsyncDecorator` does not handle asynchronous functions correctly.
C) `await asyncio.sleep(1)` is unnecessary in the decorator.
D) The `main` function needs to be decorated with `@asyncio.coroutine`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The `AsyncDecorator` does not handle asynchronous functions correctly.

The issue lies in how the `AsyncDecorator` is applied to an asynchronous function. When a function is marked as async, it returns a coroutine object that must be awaited to execute. However, the current implementation of the decorator tries to run the coroutine using `run_until_complete`, which blocks the event loop rather than allowing other tasks to run concurrently.

To correct this, you should either modify the decorator to return the coroutine directly and let the caller decide when to run it, or refactor the code to use async/await more effectively.
