    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass and a class decorator to create a singleton pattern:

```python
# Define a metaclass for creating singletons
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

# Define a decorator for applying the singleton metaclass
def singleton(cls):
    return type(cls)(cls.__name__, (cls,), {'__metaclass__': SingletonMeta})

@singleton
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self, connection_string):
        self.connection_string = connection_string

db1 = DatabaseConnection('conn_str_1')
db2 = DatabaseConnection('conn_str_2')

print(db1 == db2)  # Output: ?
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior of the code above?

A) `db1 == db2` is `False` because each instance has its own connection string.

B) `db1 == db2` is `True` because both variables refer to the same singleton instance.

C) The code raises an exception during execution due to incorrect usage of metaclasses and decorators.

D) The output cannot be determined without further information about the implementation of the `SingletonMeta`.
