    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncCounter:
    def __init__(self, start=0):
        self.start = start

    async def count_up(self):
        for i in range(self.start, self.start + 5):
            print(f"Count: {i}")
            await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    counter = AsyncCounter()
    tasks = [counter.count_up() for _ in range(3)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    asyncio.run(main())
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `count_up` method will run concurrently for all tasks, printing counts at the same time.

B) The `count_up` method will run sequentially for all tasks, printing counts in sequence.

C) The total time printed by the script will be greater than 15 seconds due to sleep delays.

D) The script will raise an error because `AsyncCounter` is not a subclass of `asyncio.Task`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The `count_up` method will run concurrently for all tasks, printing counts at the same time.

Explanation: This is correct. Each call to `counter.count_up()` creates a task that runs asynchronously. Since they are awaited in parallel with `asyncio.gather`, their execution does not block other tasks, allowing them to run concurrently. Therefore, you will see interleaved counts from different tasks, making the total time less than 15 seconds if the sleep times add up correctly.
