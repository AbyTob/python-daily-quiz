    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following code snippet that uses a decorator to measure the execution time of functions:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def process_data(data):
    for _ in range(1000000):
        data.append(_)

data_list = []
process_data(data_list)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The decorator `timing_decorator` will not work because it does not handle asynchronous functions.

B) When calling `process_data(data_list)`, the execution time will be printed to the console, but the returned value of `process_data` will not be captured and used.

C) The function `process_data` modifies its input list in-place, so the decorator will measure the time taken to append elements to the list.

D) If an exception is raised inside `process_data`, the decorator will catch it and still print the execution time before re-raising the exception.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The function `process_data` modifies its input list in-place, so the decorator will measure the time taken to append elements to the list.
