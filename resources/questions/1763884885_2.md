    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to create a singleton class. A singleton is a design pattern where a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to database...")

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()

print(db1 is db2)  # True or False?
```

What will be the output of `print(db1 is db2)`?

A) True  
B) False  
C) Runtime error  
D) None
    
    ## Answer
    A) True

Explanation: The metaclass `SingletonMeta` ensures that only one instance of the class `Database` can be created. When `db1 = Database()` and `db2 = Database()`, both variables point to the same instance stored in `_instances`. Therefore, `db1 is db2` evaluates to `True`.
