    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question): Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to track all instances of a class. The goal is to create a decorator that not only decorates an instance method but also ensures that every time the method is called, it logs how many times it has been called in total across all instances.

```python
class Tracker(type):
    _count = {}

    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        super().__init__(name, bases, dct)
        cls._count[name] = 0

def log_calls(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        instance_name = args[0].__class__.__name__
        Tracker._count[instance_name] += 1
        print(f"{func.__name__} called {Tracker._count[instance_name]} times on {instance_name}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class MyClass(metaclass=Tracker):
    @log_calls
    def my_method(self):
        pass
```

Which of the following statements correctly explains how to modify this code to achieve the goal mentioned above?

A) The `@log_calls` decorator should be applied directly on the `my_method` inside the class.

B) Each instance of `MyClass` needs its own `_count` attribute, and the metaclass should not track calls across instances.

C) Modify `Tracker._count` to increment each time any method in any subclass is called, not just `my_method`.

D) The current implementation already tracks how many times `my_method` has been called on all instances of `MyClass`. No changes are necessary.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer): A) The `@log_calls` decorator should be applied directly on the `my_method` inside the class.

Explanation: The given code uses a metaclass to track the number of times each method is called across all instances. However, it does not ensure that every time `my_method` is called, it logs how many times it has been called in total across all instances. To achieve this, the decorator should be applied directly on the `my_method`. This ensures that every time `my_method` is called, it increments its count and prints the total number of calls made to it across all instances. The metaclass correctly tracks the number of times each method is called but does not log or display this information in a way that meets the requirement specified in the question.
