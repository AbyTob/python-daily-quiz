    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a combination of decorators, metaclasses, and async/await. The goal is to understand how these concepts work together:

```python
import asyncio

def async_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return asyncio.run(func(*args, **kwargs))
    return wrapper

class AsyncMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith('__'):
                dct[attr_name] = async_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class AsyncClass(metaclass=AsyncMeta):
    async def task(self):
        print("Task started")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("Task completed")

async def main():
    obj = AsyncClass()
    await obj.task()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of the above code when executed? Explain how decorators, metaclasses, and async/await are used in this example.

A) Task started
   Task completed

B) Task started
   Task completed
   Task started
   Task completed

C) The code will raise an error because metaclasses cannot be used with async methods directly.

D) None of the above

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Task started
   Task completed

Explanation:

In this question, we have a combination of decorators, metaclasses, and async/await. Let's break down how each component is used:

1. **Async Decorator**: The `async_decorator` function is defined to wrap any callable with asyncio.run, which allows calling asynchronous functions directly from synchronous contexts.

2. **Metaclass (AsyncMeta)**: The metaclass `AsyncMeta` dynamically adds the `async_decorator` to all methods defined in classes that use this metaclass. This means that when an instance method like `task` is called on an object created from a class with this metaclass, it will be automatically decorated by `async_decorator`, turning synchronous calls into asynchronous ones.

3. **Async Class (AsyncClass)**: The `AsyncClass` uses the `AsyncMeta` metaclass. This means that any callable method in `AsyncClass` will be automatically wrapped by the async decorator during class creation. As a result, when `obj.task()` is called, it will run asynchronously.

4. **Main Function**: The `main` function creates an instance of `AsyncClass` and calls its `task` method. Due to the metaclass magic, the `task` method is treated as async within the context of this call, even though it's not directly defined as such in the class definition.

When you run this code, it will print "Task started" followed by "Task completed". The asynchronous nature ensures that "Task completed" is printed after a 1-second delay.
