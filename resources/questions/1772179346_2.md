    ## Question
    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to automatically add a method `log_call` to any class it decorates. The goal is to log every call made to a method within the decorated class.

```python
class LoggingMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for key, value in dct.items():
            if callable(value):
                dct[key] = cls.log_call(value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def log_call(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
            return result
        return wrapper

class Calculator(metaclass=LoggingMeta):
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y
    
    def multiply(self, x, y):
        return x * y
```

What is the output when you create an instance of `Calculator` and call both `add(3, 5)` and `multiply(2, 4)`?

A) 
```
Calling add with args: (3, 5), kwargs: {}
add returned 8
Calling multiply with args: (2, 4), kwargs: {}
multiply returned 8
```

B) 
```
Calling add with args: (3, 5), kwargs: {}
Adding 3 and 5 resulted in 8
Calling multiply with args: (2, 4), kwargs: {}
Multiplying 2 and 4 resulted in 8
```

C) 
```
add(3, 5)
multiply(2, 4)
```

D) 
```
Calling add with args: (3, 5), kwargs: {}
7
Calling multiply with args: (2, 4), kwargs: {}
8
```
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2: Answer**

A) 
```
Calling add with args: (3, 5), kwargs: {}
add returned 8
Calling multiply with args: (2, 4), kwargs: {}
multiply returned 8
```

Explanation:
The metaclass `LoggingMeta` is applied to the class `Calculator`. When `Calculator` is defined, the metaclass checks each attribute of the class. If an attribute is a callable (i.e., a method), it replaces that method with a wrapper function `log_call`. This wrapper logs the call details and then calls the original method. Therefore, when we create an instance of `Calculator` and call its methods, the log statements are executed as expected.
