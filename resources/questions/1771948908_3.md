    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that attempts to use a metaclass to track all instances of a class:

```python
class InstanceTracker(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['_instance'] = None
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            InstanceTracker._instances[cls] = [cls._instance]
        else:
            InstanceTracker._instances[cls].append(cls._instance)
        return cls._instance

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceTracker):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass(10)
obj2 = MyClass(20)

print(InstanceTracker._instances)  # Output?
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the code above?

A. The `_instance` attribute will be set on each class that uses `InstanceTracker`.
B. Multiple instances of `MyClass` can be created without any limitations.
C. The code will raise an error because `__call__` in `InstanceTracker` tries to access `_instances` before it is initialized.
D. The output of `print(InstanceTracker._instances)` will show two instances of `MyClass`.
    
    ## Answer
    [A] The `_instance` attribute will be set on each class that uses `InstanceTracker`.
Explanation: The metaclass correctly sets the `_instance` attribute in the dictionary for the class it's applied to. However, this does not affect how many instances can be created or track multiple instances of the same class.
