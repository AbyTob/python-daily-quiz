    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to track instances of a class:

```python
class InstanceTracker(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=InstanceTracker):
    pass

# Usage
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # Output: ?
```

What will be the output of `print(s1 is s2)`?

A) False  
B) True  
C) AttributeError  
D) TypeError
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) True

Explanation:

The correct answer is B) True. 

The metaclass `InstanceTracker` overrides the `__call__` method to ensure that only one instance of any class defined with this metaclass can exist. When an attempt is made to create a new instance, the metaclass checks if an instance already exists in its `_instances` dictionary. If it does, it returns the existing instance; otherwise, it creates a new one and stores it.

In the given code:
- `s1 = Singleton()` calls `Singleton.__call__`, which finds that no instance of `Singleton` exists, so it creates a new one and stores it in `_instances`.
- `s2 = Singleton()` again calls `Singleton.__call__`, but this time it finds an instance already exists in `_instances`, so it returns the existing instance.

Therefore, `s1 is s2` evaluates to True because both variables point to the same object.
