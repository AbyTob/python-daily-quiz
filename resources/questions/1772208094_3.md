    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that aims to create a class decorator which measures the execution time of methods within a class:

```python
import time

def measure_time(cls):
    for name, method in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(method):
            setattr(cls, name, wrap_method(method))
    return cls

def wrap_method(method):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = method(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{method.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@measure_time
class ExampleClass:
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(1)
```

When `ExampleClass` is instantiated and its methods are called, which of the following statements about the output is true?

A) The methods will execute without any time measurement.
B) Each method's execution time will be printed after the method completes, but the total execution time won't be shown.
C) An error will occur because `measure_time` cannot modify class methods dynamically.
D) Each method's execution time will be printed and the total execution time of all methods will also be calculated.
    
    ## Answer
    [C] An error will occur because `measure_time` cannot modify class methods dynamically.
