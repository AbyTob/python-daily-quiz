    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator to modify the behavior of a class method:

```python
def log_access(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Accessing {func.__name__}")
        return func(self, *args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class DataHandler:
    @log_access
    def read_data(self, file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            data = file.read()
        return data

# Usage example:
dh = DataHandler()
data = dh.read_data('example.txt')
```

When the `read_data` method of an instance of `DataHandler` is called, it logs access to the method before executing the actual method. However, there's a potential issue with this design that could affect performance under certain conditions.

Which scenario would most likely cause performance degradation when using this decorator?

A) High-frequency calls to `read_data` from a single thread  
B) Multiple threads calling `read_data` simultaneously  
C) Accessing the file system in a sequential manner  
D) Calling the method only once
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer: B) Multiple threads calling `read_data` simultaneously**

**Explanation:** The decorator `log_access` logs each access to the decorated method. When multiple threads call `read_data` simultaneously, each thread will execute its own copy of the `wrapper` function from the decorator. This can lead to a significant overhead due to the context switching between threads and the repeated execution of the logging statement. In contrast, options A and C involve fewer threads and simpler access patterns, while option D only involves a single call, making it the least likely to cause performance degradation in this context.
