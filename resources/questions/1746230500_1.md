    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that aims to create a decorator for an asynchronous function to measure its execution time:

```python
import asyncio

def time_decorator(func):
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds to run")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_decorator
async def async_task():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Task Completed"

# Example usage
asyncio.run(async_task())
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

B) The use of `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` inside the wrapper function is incorrect and will raise an error.

C) The `@time_decorator` syntax applies the decorator to any synchronous or asynchronous function without modification.

D) The execution time measurement is accurate but can be improved by using a more precise timer.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The decorator `time_decorator` correctly measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

Explanation: The code uses `asyncio.get_running_loop().time()` to get the current time asynchronously, which is appropriate for measuring the execution time of an asyncio function. This method ensures that the timing does not interfere with other tasks running in the event loop. The decorator works as intended and provides accurate execution time measurements for asynchronous functions.
