    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to track all instances of a class. The goal is to modify this implementation so that it also counts how many times each method within the class has been called.

```python
class InstanceTrackerMeta(type):
    _instances = set()
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        cls._instances.add(instance)
        return instance

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceTrackerMeta):
    def method1(self):
        pass
    
    def method2(self):
        pass

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

print(f"Instances: {len(MyClass._instances)}")  # Output should be 2
```

Modify the metaclass and class definitions to also track how many times each method is called.

A) Provide a solution that uses a dictionary in the metaclass to count method calls for each instance of the class.
B) Suggest a different approach using decorators and context managers.
C) Provide an example of using threading to manage the counting of method calls across multiple threads.
D) Propose a modification that uses a decorator within the class methods instead of changing the metaclass.

Part 2 (Answer):
A) Correct. The solution involves modifying the metaclass to include a dictionary for each instance where method names are keys and their call counts as values. Here's how you can implement it:

```python
class InstanceTrackerMeta(type):
    _instances = set()
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        instance._method_calls = {}
        cls._instances.add(instance)
        return instance

    @staticmethod
    def count_method_calls(func):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if func.__name__ not in self._method_calls:
                self._method_calls[func.__name__] = 0
            self._method_calls[func.__name__] += 1
            return func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

class MyClass(metaclass=InstanceTrackerMeta):
    @InstanceTrackerMeta.count_method_calls
    def method1(self):
        pass
    
    @InstanceTrackerMeta.count_method_calls
    def method2(self):
        pass

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

obj1.method1()
obj1.method2()
obj1.method1()  # Calling method1 twice

print(f"Instances: {len(MyClass._instances)}")  # Output should be 2
print(f"Method1 calls for obj1: {obj1._method_calls['method1']}")
print(f"Method2 calls for obj1: {obj1._method_calls['method2']}")
```

Explanation:
- The metaclass `InstanceTrackerMeta` now includes a `_method_calls` dictionary for each instance.
- A static method `count_method_calls` is added to the metaclass, which wraps any class method with logic that counts how many times it has been called on an instance.
