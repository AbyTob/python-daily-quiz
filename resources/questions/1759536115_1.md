    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses metaclasses to create a class factory:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        dct['created'] = True
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

print(MyClass.created)
```

What does this code output and why?

A) An error because metaclasses cannot be used with regular classes  
B) The text "Creating class MyClass" followed by `True`  
C) The text "Creating class Meta" followed by `True`  
D) `False`
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer: B) The text "Creating class MyClass" followed by `True`**

Explanation:
In the provided code, `Meta` is a metaclass that overrides the `__new__` method. When `MyClass` is defined, Python's type system automatically calls this method with the necessary arguments. Inside the `__new__` method of the metaclass, it prints the message "Creating class {name}", where `{name}` is the name of the class being created (`'MyClass'`). Additionally, it adds a new attribute `created` to the class dictionary and sets its value to `True`. After defining `MyClass`, we print the value of `MyClass.created`, which will be `True`.

Option A is incorrect because metaclasses can indeed be used with regular classes. Option C is wrong because the `__new__` method is called on the metaclass itself, not on the class being created. Option D is incorrect as the value of `MyClass.created` is set to `True`, not `False`.
