**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'x' in dct:
            print(f"Class {name} has attribute x")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class MyOtherClass(metaclass=Meta):
    x = 10
```

What will be printed to the console when `MyClass` and `MyOtherClass` are defined?

A) "Class MyClass has attribute x"  
B) "Class MyOtherClass has attribute x"  
C) Both A and B  
D) Neither A nor B

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) "Class MyOtherClass has attribute x"

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks if the class dictionary contains an attribute named 'x' during the creation of a new class. In this case, `MyClass` does not have any attributes, so no message is printed. However, `MyOtherClass` defines an attribute `x`, so when it is created, the metaclass outputs "Class MyOtherClass has attribute x".
