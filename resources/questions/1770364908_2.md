    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
from typing import Callable

def memoize(func: Callable) -> Callable:
    cache = {}
    
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in cache:
            cache[args] = func(*args)
        return cache[args]
    
    return wrapper

@memoize
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Create a new memoized version of the fibonacci function
new_fib = memoize(fibonacci)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the `memoize` decorator and its usage?

A) The `memoize` decorator stores results in a local cache for each call to the original function, preventing redundant calculations.

B) Calling `new_fib(5)` will execute the original `fibonacci` function multiple times because `memoize` does not remember previous calls.

C) Using `@memoize` on `fibonacci` creates a new function that remembers its results but still allows for the original function to be called directly.

D) The `new_fib` function is identical to the original `fibonacci` function and both will compute Fibonacci numbers in the same manner without memoization.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `memoize` decorator stores results in a local cache for each call to the original function, preventing redundant calculations.
