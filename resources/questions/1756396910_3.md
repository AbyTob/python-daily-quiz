    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

class ThreadSafeCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def increment(self):
        with self.lock:
            self.value += 1

def thread_task(counter, iterations):
    for _ in range(iterations):
        counter.increment()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    counter = ThreadSafeCounter()
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=thread_task, args=(counter, 1000)) for _ in range(10)]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    print(counter.value)
```

What is the most efficient way to optimize this code to ensure it scales better as the number of threads and iterations increases?

A) Implement a global lock instead of using an instance lock.
B) Use multiprocessing instead of threading.
C) Change the increment method to be atomic by removing the lock.
D) Use asyncio for asynchronous execution.
    
    ## Answer
    Answer: B) Use multiprocessing instead of threading.

Explanation: While both threading and multiprocessing can be used to achieve parallelism in Python, they have different use cases due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). In a multi-threaded application, if threads are CPU-bound (i.e., performing heavy computations), the GIL will still limit performance because only one thread can execute at a time. Multiprocessing, on the other hand, allows true parallel execution by creating separate Python processes, each with its own Python interpreter and GIL. This is beneficial when dealing with CPU-bound tasks, as it eliminates the overhead of the GIL and allows for efficient use of multiple processors. In this scenario, since the task involves updating a shared counter (a potentially CPU-bound operation), multiprocessing would provide better performance scaling compared to threading.
