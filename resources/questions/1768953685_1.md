    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes a decorator to track function calls:

```python
def call_counter(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        wrapper.calls += 1
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    wrapper.calls = 0
    return wrapper

@call_counter
def sample_function():
    pass

# Simulate some function calls
sample_function()
sample_function()

print(sample_function.calls)  # Output: ?
```

What will be the output of `sample_function().calls` after executing the code above?

A. 1  
B. 2  
C. 0  
D. Error
    
    ## Answer
    B. 2

The decorator `call_counter` increments a class attribute `calls` each time the decorated function is called. The increment occurs within the nested `wrapper` function, which then returns the result of calling the original function. After simulating two calls to `sample_function`, accessing `sample_function.calls` should yield 2 because it tracks the number of times `sample_function` has been invoked.
