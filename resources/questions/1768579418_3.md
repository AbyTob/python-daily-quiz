    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval
        self._timer = None

    async def _run(self):
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
            print(f"Timer ticked at {asyncio.get_running_loop().time()}")

    def start(self):
        if not self._timer:
            self._timer = asyncio.create_task(self._run())

    def stop(self):
        if self._timer:
            self._timer.cancel()
            self._timer = None

class AsyncCounter(AsyncTimer):
    def __init__(self, interval):
        super().__init__(interval)
        self.count = 0

    async def _run(self):
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
            self.count += 1
            print(f"Counter ticked at {asyncio.get_running_loop().time()}, count: {self.count}")

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    counter = AsyncCounter(2)
    counter.start()
    
    try:
        await asyncio.sleep(10)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    
    counter.stop()
```

What is the correct order of execution for this code snippet? Explain how the `AsyncTimer` and `AsyncCounter` classes interact with each other in terms of their methods.

A) The `AsyncCounter._run()` method will print "Counter ticked at ... count: 1" after 2 seconds, then "Counter ticked at ... count: 2" after another 2 seconds, and so on. The `AsyncTimer._run()` method will run concurrently, printing a tick every 2 seconds.

B) The `AsyncTimer._run()` method will print a tick every 2 seconds, and the `AsyncCounter._run()` method will also run concurrently but its first tick will be delayed until after 2 seconds. It will then print "Counter ticked at ... count: 1" and continue to increment every 2 seconds.

C) The `AsyncTimer._run()` method will run first, printing a tick every 2 seconds, and the `AsyncCounter._run()` method will run second, also printing a tick every 2 seconds. Both methods will start immediately upon calling the `start()` method on their respective instances.

D) The `AsyncCounter._run()` method will print "Counter ticked at ... count: 1" after 4 seconds, then "Counter ticked at ... count: 2" after another 4 seconds, and so on. The `AsyncTimer._run()` method will run concurrently, printing a tick every 2 seconds.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `AsyncTimer._run()` method will print a tick every 2 seconds, and the `AsyncCounter._run()` method will also run concurrently but its first tick will be delayed until after 2 seconds. It will then print "Counter ticked at ... count: 1" and continue to increment every 2 seconds.

Explanation:
- Both `AsyncTimer` and `AsyncCounter` are instances of the same base class `AsyncTimer`.
- When `start()` is called on an instance of `AsyncCounter`, it calls the `start()` method from its superclass (`AsyncTimer`). This starts a new task with `_run()`, which is a coroutine in both classes.
- The `_run()` method in `AsyncCounter` increments a counter and prints the tick, while `_run()` in `AsyncTimer` simply prints a tick without any additional logic.
- Since `_run()` in both classes are run as tasks by calling `asyncio.create_task(self._run())`, they will execute concurrently. The first tick of `AsyncCounter` will occur after the initial 2-second delay set by its constructor.
