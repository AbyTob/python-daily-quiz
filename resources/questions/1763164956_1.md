    [QUESTION]  
You are tasked with creating a custom context manager in Python that manages a resource which needs to be opened and closed. However, the resource must also log its usage whenever it is accessed or modified. Your custom context manager should use the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods for managing the resource and a descriptor for logging.

Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```python
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod

class LoggingDescriptor:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        print(f"Accessing {self.name}")
        return instance.__dict__.get(self.name)

    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        print(f"Setting {self.name} to {value}")
        instance.__dict__[self.name] = value

class Resource(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def open(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def close(self):
        pass

class ManagedResource(Resource):
    name = LoggingDescriptor('name')
    
    def __init__(self, initial_name):
        self.name = initial_name
    
    def open(self):
        print(f"Opening {self.name}")
    
    def close(self):
        print(f"Closing {self.name}")

@contextmanager
def manage_resource(resource):
    try:
        resource.open()
        yield resource
    finally:
        resource.close()

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with manage_resource(ManagedResource("example")) as res:
        res.name = "new_name"
```

Which of the following statements about this code is correct?

A) The `LoggingDescriptor` will not log any messages because it is never accessed.

B) When an instance of `ManagedResource` is created, the descriptor immediately logs that it is accessing the `name` attribute.

C) The `manage_resource` context manager will correctly open and close the resource, and log each access to the `name` attribute.

D) The `ManagedResource` class does not implement the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, so it cannot be used as a context manager directly.
    
    ## Answer
    C) The `manage_resource` context manager will correctly open and close the resource, and log each access to the `name` attribute.

Explanation: The `LoggingDescriptor` correctly logs when the `name` attribute is accessed or modified. The `ManagedResource` class implements the required methods (`open`, `close`) for opening and closing the resource. When used in the context manager with the `with` statement, it will open the resource before executing the block of code, log accesses to the `name` attribute via the descriptor, and then close the resource when exiting the block.
