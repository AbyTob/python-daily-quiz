**Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message
    
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{self.message}: {end_time - self.start_time:.2f} seconds")

class Cached:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
    
    def __call__(self, func):
        def wrapper(*args):
            if args not in self.cache:
                self.cache[args] = func(*args)
            return self.cache[args]
        return wrapper

@Cached()
@Timer("Function Execution Time")
def compute_heavy_task(n):
    result = 0
    for i in range(n):
        result += i * i
    return result

# Example usage:
result = compute_heavy_task(10000)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

What will the output be when the `compute_heavy_task` function is called with an argument of 10,000? Explain why.

**Options:**
A) Function Execution Time: X.XX seconds  
B) Result: 333335000  
C) An error occurs because `@Cached()` and `@Timer()` cannot be used together.  
D) Function Execution Time: Y.YY seconds followed by Result: 333335000

**Part 2: Answer**

B) Result: 333335000  

Explanation:

- The `@Cached()` decorator is applied first, and it caches the result of `compute_heavy_task(10000)`. When `compute_heavy_task` is called with this argument, the cached value is immediately returned.
  
- The `@Timer()` decorator measures the execution time of a function. However, since `@Cached()` has already executed and stored the result, the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods of the `Timer` class are not called when `compute_heavy_task(10000)` is invoked for the second time.

- Therefore, the output will only include the cached result:  
  Result: 333335000
