    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super(SingletonMeta, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Usage
singleton1 = Singleton(10)
singleton2 = Singleton(20)

print(singleton1.value)  # Output: ?
print(singleton2.value)  # Output: ?
```

What will be printed when the code is executed?

A) 10, 10  
B) 10, 20  
C) 20, 20  
D) An error
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer:** B) 10, 20

**Explanation:** The `SingletonMeta` metaclass uses a dictionary `_instances` to store instances of classes it creates. When the `Singleton` class is instantiated, `__call__` in `SingletonMeta` checks if an instance already exists for `Singleton`. If not, it creates one and stores it in `_instances`. Any subsequent instantiation of `Singleton` will return the already created instance. In this case, both `singleton1` and `singleton2` refer to the same instance, so their `value` attribute is the value that was set when the instance was first created (i.e., 10).
