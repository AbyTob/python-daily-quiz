# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a decorator and a metaclass:

```python
# Define a decorator
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

# Define a metaclass
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['my_method'] = my_decorator(dct.get('my_method', lambda: None))
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Create a class using the metaclass
class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    def my_method(self):
        print("This is the original method.")

# Usage
obj = MyClass()
obj.my_method()
```

What will be printed to the console when you run this code?

A) Something is happening before the function is called. This is the original method. Something is happening after the function is called.

B) Something is happening before the function is called. None Something is happening after the function is called.

C) Error: my_method is not callable

D) Something is happening before the function is called. This is the original method.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Something is happening before the function is called. This is the original method. Something is happening after the function is called.

**Explanation:**

In this code, `MyMeta` is a metaclass that modifies any class it's applied to by wrapping its `my_method` with a decorator (`my_decorator`). The decorator adds print statements before and after calling the method.

When an instance of `MyClass` is created and `my_method` is called on that instance, the output should be:

1. "Something is happening before the function is called."
2. "This is the original method."
3. "Something is happening after the function is called."

The decorator ensures that these print statements are added to the call to `my_method`, making option A the correct answer.
