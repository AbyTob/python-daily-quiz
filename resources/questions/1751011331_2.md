    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators and metaclasses:

```python
import types

def debug_method(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class DebugMeta(type):
    @classmethod
    def __prepare__(mcls, name, bases, **kwds):
        return super().__prepare__(name, bases, **kwds)

    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, dct, **kwds):
        new_dct = {k: debug_method(v) if callable(v) else v for k, v in dct.items()}
        return super().__new__(mcls, name, bases, new_dct, **kwds)

class MyClass(metaclass=DebugMeta):
    def method1(self, x):
        return x + 1

    def method2(self, y):
        return y * 2
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `debug_method` decorator only affects instance methods.
B) The `DebugMeta` metaclass changes all callable attributes of a class to debug versions.
C) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, both `method1` and `method2` will be called with additional debug prints before execution.
D) `MyClass` cannot have any non-callable attributes because the metaclass modifies only methods.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `DebugMeta` metaclass changes all callable attributes of a class to debug versions.

Explanation:
- The `debug_method` decorator wraps any callable (method, function) with additional debugging print statements.
- The `DebugMeta` metaclass uses `__prepare__` and `__new__` to apply the `debug_method` decorator to all callable items in the class dictionary before the class is fully created. This includes both methods (`method1` and `method2`) as well as any other callable attributes that might be added later.
- Therefore, when an instance of `MyClass` is created, calling either `method1` or `method2` will indeed include additional debug prints before the actual method execution, making option C true. However, since all callables are affected, option A and D are incorrect because they only apply to methods. Option B accurately describes the behavior of the metaclass.
