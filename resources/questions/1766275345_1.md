    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses decorators and metaclasses together:

```python
class Decorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Decorator called")
        return self.func(*args, **kwargs)

def decorator(func):
    @Decorator
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Function decorated")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

@decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def my_method(self):
        print("Method called")
```

When you create an instance of `MyClass` and call its method, what is the expected output?

A) Decorator called  
   Function decorated  
   Method called  

B) Creating class MyClass  
   Decorator called  
   Function decorated  
   Method called  

C) Creating class MyClass  
   Decorator called  
   Method called  

D) Error
    
    ## Answer
    A) Decorator called  
   Function decorated  
   Method called  

Explanation:
- The `decorator` function is applied to the `MyClass`, which in turn uses the `Decorator` class as a decorator.
- When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it goes through the normal object creation process in Python.
- The metaclass `Meta` is first used to create the class, so "Creating class MyClass" is printed.
- The `decorator` function then wraps the `my_method`, and when you call the method on an instance of `MyClass`, it goes through this wrapper. This leads to:
  - "Decorator called"
  - "Function decorated"
  - "Method called"

Therefore, the correct output is option A.
