    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time of {self.func.__name__}: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result

@Timer
def my_function():
    time.sleep(2)

my_function()
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `Timer` class is a metaclass that modifies classes at creation.
B) When `my_function()` is called, it measures and prints the execution time of itself.
C) The `@Timer` decorator is applied to the `Timer` class itself, not to `my_function`.
D) Using `time.sleep(2)` inside `my_function` makes it impossible for `my_function` to be used in an asynchronous context.
    
    ## Answer
    B) When `my_function()` is called, it measures and prints the execution time of itself.
