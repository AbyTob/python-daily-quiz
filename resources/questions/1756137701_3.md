    ## Question
    [QUESTION] Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Pre-execution")
        result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Post-execution")
        return result

@AsyncDecorator
async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Data fetched"

async def main():
    data = await fetch_data()
    print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `AsyncDecorator` will not execute because it does not handle synchronous functions.

B) When `fetch_data()` is called, "Pre-execution" and "Post-execution" will be printed immediately before and after the sleep.

C) The `main` function must be decorated with `@asyncio.coroutine` to work with asynchronous functions.

D) `AsyncDecorator` can be used to wrap both synchronous and asynchronous functions.
    
    ## Answer
    D) `AsyncDecorator` can be used to wrap both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

Explanation:
- The decorator is designed to handle any callable, not just specific types. 
- When the `fetch_data()` function, which is an asynchronous function, is called through the `AsyncDecorator`, it correctly prints "Pre-execution" before starting the sleep, waits for the sleep to complete, then prints "Post-execution". 
- The decorator does not differentiate between synchronous and asynchronous functions; it simply calls whatever callable is passed to it.
