# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_task(n):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return n * 2

async def main():
    tasks = [async_task(i) for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    asyncio.run(main())
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total time taken: {end_time - start_time}")
```

What is the output of this program and how does it illustrate the use of asyncio?

A) It will print [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] in less than a second.
B) It will print [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] but take more than 5 seconds to run.
C) It will raise an exception because asyncio.sleep is not allowed in main.
D) It will print an error message because asyncio.gather does not support asynchronous functions.
    
    ## Answer
    A) It will print [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] in less than a second. This code demonstrates how asyncio allows for non-blocking execution of tasks, enabling the program to perform other operations while waiting for I/O-bound tasks like sleep to complete. The use of `asyncio.gather` efficiently runs all tasks concurrently, thus reducing the total time taken compared to running them sequentially.
