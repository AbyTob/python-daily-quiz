    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import threading

def thread_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=func, args=args, kwargs=kwargs)
        thread.start()
        return thread
    return wrapper

@thread_decorator
def long_running_function(duration):
    import time
    print(f"Starting function for {duration} seconds")
    time.sleep(duration)
    print("Function completed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threads = []
    for i in range(5):
        t = long_running_function(i*2)
        threads.append(t)

    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the code?

A) The function `long_running_function` will run synchronously when called.
B) The `thread_decorator` ensures that each call to `long_running_function` runs in a separate thread and starts immediately upon decoration.
C) The main program will not wait for any threads to complete before exiting because it does not use `join`.
D) Each instance of the decorated function `long_running_function` shares the same thread.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The `thread_decorator` ensures that each call to `long_running_function` runs in a separate thread and starts immediately upon decoration.

Explanation:
- Option A is incorrect because the function `long_running_function` is designed to run asynchronously due to the use of threading.
- Option B is correct. The decorator wraps the function so that it runs in its own thread, and since `thread.start()` is called inside the wrapper, each call starts immediately.
- Option C is incorrect because `join` is used on all threads before exiting the main program, ensuring that all threads have completed execution.
- Option D is incorrect. Each call to the decorated function indeed runs in a separate thread, so there's no shared thread among instances of the decorated function.
