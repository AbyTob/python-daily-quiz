    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'magic_method' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Missing magic method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def regular_method(self):
        pass

# Uncommenting the following line will raise a TypeError
# class AnotherClass(metaclass=Meta): pass
```

What is the role of the `Meta` metaclass in this example? Choose the best option that describes its purpose.

A) To enforce the presence of specific methods in classes  
B) To provide additional properties to instances of classes  
C) To control the creation and initialization of class objects  
D) To implement thread-safe operations
    
    ## Answer
    [C] The role of the `Meta` metaclass in this example is to control the creation and initialization of class objects. It checks if a class has a specific method (`magic_method`) during the class creation process using the `__new__` method, raising a `TypeError` if it's missing.
