    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that utilizes both decorators and metaclasses:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'greet' not in dct:
            raise TypeError("Class must have a greet method")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

def greet_decorator(cls):
    original_greet = cls.greet

    @classmethod
    def greet(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Greet decorator says:", end=" ")
        return original_greet(*args, **kwargs)
    
    cls.greet = greet
    return cls

@greet_decorator
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello!"

# Create an instance of MyClass and call its greet method
instance = MyClass()
print(instance.greet())
```

What will be the output when the code is executed? Choose the correct option:

A) Greet decorator says: Hello!
B) TypeError: Class must have a greet method
C) AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'greet'
D) None
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] A) Greet decorator says: Hello!

Explanation: The code defines a metaclass `Meta` that ensures any subclass must implement a `greet` method. It also defines a decorator `greet_decorator` that wraps the original `greet` method, adding a greeting before calling it. When an instance of `MyClass` is created and its `greet` method is called, the output will be "Greet decorator says: Hello!", demonstrating both the metaclass enforcing the presence of the `greet` method and the decorator modifying how the method behaves.
