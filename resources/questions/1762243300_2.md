    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses metaclasses to create a singleton pattern:

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class DatabaseConnection(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to database...")
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the `DatabaseConnection` class?

A) Every time a new instance of `DatabaseConnection` is created, it will always connect to the database.

B) The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of `DatabaseConnection` can exist at any given time.

C) Calling `DatabaseConnection().connect()` multiple times will result in multiple connections to the database.

D) Metaclasses cannot be used to implement design patterns like singletons in Python.
    
    ## Answer
    B) The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of `DatabaseConnection` can exist at any given time.

Explanation: The metaclass `SingletonMeta` overrides the `__call__` method to control how instances of `DatabaseConnection` are created. It checks if an instance already exists in `_instances` dictionary; if not, it creates a new one and stores it. Any subsequent attempts to create an instance will return the already existing instance, thus ensuring that only one instance of `DatabaseConnection` can exist at any given time.
