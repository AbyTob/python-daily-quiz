    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet that uses a combination of decorators, metaclasses, and async/await:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Create an instance of the class with a custom method
        dct['async_method'] = lambda self: print(f"Instance {self} has been created")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=AsyncMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    async def my_async_function(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print(f"Value: {self.value}")

async def main():
    obj = MyClass("test")
    obj.async_method()
    await obj.my_async_function()

# Run the event loop
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?

A) The `AsyncMeta` metaclass adds a new method to instances of `MyClass`.
B) When calling `obj.async_method()`, it will print "Instance <__main__.MyClass object at 0x...> has been created".
C) The `my_async_function` is executed synchronously and will block the event loop.
D) All of the above.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `AsyncMeta` metaclass adds a new method to instances of `MyClass`.

Explanation:
- The `AsyncMeta` metaclass uses the `__new__` method to add a new method named `async_method` to any class that uses it as a metaclass. This method is then available on all instances of `MyClass`.
- When calling `obj.async_method()`, it will indeed print "Instance <__main__.MyClass object at 0x...> has been created", where `<__main__.MyClass object at 0x...>` represents the memory address of the instance.
- The `my_async_function` is defined as an async method, which means it returns a coroutine when called. Calling `await obj.my_async_function()` will not block the event loop; instead, it schedules the coroutine to run and waits for its completion, allowing other tasks in the event loop to execute concurrently.
