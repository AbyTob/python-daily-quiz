    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, interval):
        self.interval = interval

    async def __aenter__(self):
        print(f"Starting timer with interval {self.interval}")
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Stopping timer")

async def do_something():
    async with AsyncTimer(2) as timer:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("Doing something")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

# Example usage
asyncio.run(do_something())
```

What is the output of this code, and why?

A) Starting timer with interval 2  
   Doing something  
   Stopping timer  

B) Starting timer with interval 2  
   Stopping timer  
   Doing something  

C) Doing something  
   Starting timer with interval 2  
   Stopping timer  

D) Error: context manager must define __aenter__ and __aexit__

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) Starting timer with interval 2  
   Doing something  
   Stopping timer  

**Explanation:**

The output is `Starting timer with interval 2`, followed by `Doing something`, and finally `Stopping timer`. This sequence is determined by the order of operations in the context manager protocol.

- When entering the `AsyncTimer` context manager, the `__aenter__` method is called. It prints "Starting timer with interval 2" and returns the `self` instance.
- The code then proceeds to execute the block within the `async with` statement, which consists of two calls to `await asyncio.sleep(1)`, followed by a print statement.
- After exiting the `AsyncTimer` context manager, the `__aexit__` method is called. It prints "Stopping timer".

The order of the print statements is therefore `Starting timer with interval 2`, followed by `Doing something`, and finally `Stopping timer`. This output demonstrates the correct behavior of an asynchronous context manager in Python.
