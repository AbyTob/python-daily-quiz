    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that attempts to implement a simple logging system using a decorator and metaclasses. The goal is to automatically log the entry and exit of all methods in a class.

```python
import time

def log_method_calls(cls):
    for name, attr in cls.__dict__.items():
        if callable(attr):
            setattr(cls, name, log_entry_exit(attr))
    return cls

class MetaLogger(type):
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, dct):
        decorated = log_method_calls(dct)
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, decorated)

def log_entry_exit(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Entering {func.__name__}")
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Exiting {func.__name__}, took {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Logger(metaclass=MetaLogger):
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(0.7)
```

Which of the following is true about the above code?

A) It will correctly log the entry and exit of all methods in the `Logger` class, including their execution times.
B) It will raise a TypeError because metaclasses cannot be used with decorators.
C) It will only log the entry of each method but not their execution times.
D) The logging functionality will not work as intended due to the use of `type.__new__`.
    
    ## Answer
    A) It will correctly log the entry and exit of all methods in the `Logger` class, including their execution times.

Explanation: The code uses a decorator (`log_method_calls`) that applies another decorator (`log_entry_exit`) to each callable attribute (method) of the class. Additionally, it employs a metaclass (`MetaLogger`) to ensure that this logging is applied whenever a class using this metaclass is instantiated. Therefore, when an instance of `Logger` calls its methods, the entry and exit logs along with execution times will be printed as expected.
