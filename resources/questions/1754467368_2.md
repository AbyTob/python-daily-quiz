    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses decorators, metaclasses, and context managers. Your task is to predict the output of this program:

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

def debug_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

@SingletonMeta
class SingletonClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = "Singleton Value"

    @contextmanager
    def managed_resource(self):
        print("Acquiring resource")
        try:
            yield "Resource"
        finally:
            print("Releasing resource")

def main():
    obj1 = SingletonClass()
    obj2 = SingletonClass()

    print(obj1 is obj2)  # Should print True

    with obj1.managed_resource() as resource:
        print(f"Using {resource}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

What will be the output of this program?

A) `Calling __init__ with args: (), kwargs: {}`  
   `Singleton Value`  
   `True`  
   `Acquiring resource`  
   `Using Resource`  
   `Releasing resource`

B) `True`  
   `Acquiring resource`  
   `Using Resource`  
   `Releasing resource`

C) `Calling __init__ with args: (), kwargs: {}`  
   `Singleton Value`  
   `True`  
   `Acquiring resource`  
   `Using Resource`

D) `True`  
   `Acquiring resource`  
   `Resource`  
   `Releasing resource`

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) This is correct. The program demonstrates the use of a decorator to debug function calls, a singleton metaclass to ensure only one instance of `SingletonClass` exists, and a context manager within the class to manage resources. The output correctly shows that both variables `obj1` and `obj2` are indeed the same instance (`True`), and it properly manages the resource in the `with` statement.

B) This is incorrect because the `debug_decorator` is applied to `SingletonClass`'s constructor, which isn't called due to the singleton pattern. The `managed_resource` context manager is called correctly within the `main` function.

C) This is partially correct as it shows that both `obj1` and `obj2` are the same instance (`True`). However, the output of the resource management part is missing a step where the resource is returned or used. The output should end with "Releasing resource".

D) This is incorrect because the return value of the context manager is not printed in the expected format. It should print "Using Resource" followed by the result returned from the `yield` statement, which is "Resource".
