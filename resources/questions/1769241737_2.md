    ## Answer
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses a decorator and a metaclass:

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'my_method' in dct:
            dct['my_method'] = my_decorator(dct['my_method'])
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def my_method(self):
        print("Hello from my_method.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    obj = MyClass()
    obj.my_method()
```

Which of the following statements is true about the code above?

A) The `my_method` of `MyClass` will not be decorated by the `my_decorator`.

B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print "Something is happening before the function is called."

C) The decorator `my_decorator` does not affect the execution of the method.

D) The metaclass `Meta` will only modify methods in classes that explicitly define a method named `my_method`.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

B) When an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will print "Something is happening before the function is called."

Explanation:
- The metaclass `Meta` dynamically modifies the class by wrapping any method named `my_method` with `my_decorator`. 
- In the example provided, the `my_method` defined in `MyClass` is decorated because `my_method` exists in the dictionary when the metaclass `Meta` tries to create a new class. 
- As a result, calling `obj.my_method()` will first print "Something is happening before the function is called," then execute the original `my_method`, and finally print "Something is happening after the function is called."
