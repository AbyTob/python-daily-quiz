    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method to all classes it decorates:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'greet' not in dct:
            dct['greet'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class Person(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

p = Person("John")
print(p.greet())
```

What will be the output of this code when executed?

A) `Hello from Person`  
B) `Hello from Meta`  
C) An error occurs  
D) The code will not run due to incorrect syntax
    
    ## Answer
    **Answer: A) Hello from Person**

Explanation: The metaclass `Meta` checks if the method `greet` is present in any class it decorates. If not, it adds a default `greet` method that returns a greeting string including the name of the class. When the `Person` class is defined with `metaclass=Meta`, the `greet` method is added to it automatically because it does not already have one. Therefore, when an instance of `Person` is created and its `greet` method is called, it outputs "Hello from Person".
