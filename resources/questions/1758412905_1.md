    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import threading

class MyThread(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, thread_id, name, counter):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        self.thread_id = thread_id
        self.name = name
        self.counter = counter

    def run(self):
        print(f"Starting {self.name}")
        # Lock acquired to synchronize threads
        thread_lock.acquire()
        print_time(self.name, self.counter, 3)
        # Lock released after finishing the task
        thread_lock.release()
        print(f"Exiting {self.name}")

def print_time(thread_name, delay, counter):
    while counter:
        time.sleep(delay)
        print(f"{thread_name}: {time.ctime(time.time())}")
        counter -= 1

thread_lock = threading.Lock()

# Create new threads
thread1 = MyThread(1, "Thread-1", 1)
thread2 = MyThread(2, "Thread-2", 2)

# Start new Threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Add threads to thread list
threads = []
threads.append(thread1)
threads.append(thread2)

# Wait for all threads to complete
for t in threads:
    t.join()

print("Exiting Main Thread")
```

This code demonstrates the use of threading in Python. Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using threads in this context?

A) Improves performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores  
B) Allows independent execution of tasks concurrently  
C) Automatically handles synchronization issues between threads  
D) Enables sharing of global variables among threads
    
    ## Answer
    A) Improves performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores
