    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to enhance class behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

print("Finished creating MyClass")
```

What happens when you run this code? Choose the correct sequence of outputs from the following options:

A) Creating MyClass
   Finished creating MyClass

B) Finished creating MyClass
   Creating MyClass

C) An error is raised because metaclasses cannot be used with new-style classes.

D) Nothing happens; the output depends on other Python settings.
    
    ## Answer
    A) Creating MyClass
   Finished creating MyClass
