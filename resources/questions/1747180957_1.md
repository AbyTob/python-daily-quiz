    [QUESTION]
You are tasked with creating a decorator that measures the execution time of a function, but this time you want to ensure that it is only applied to functions within specific classes. To achieve this, you decide to use both decorators and metaclasses.

Here's your starting point:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} executed in {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimeMeasuringMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith("__"):
                dct[attr_name] = timing_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class TimeMeasuringClass(metaclass=TimeMeasuringMeta):
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(1.0)

# Example usage:
tm = TimeMeasuringClass()
tm.method1()  # Should print execution time
tm.method2()  # Should print execution time
```

You want to ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods of classes defined with `TimeMeasuringMeta`. However, you also notice that applying decorators directly to method definitions within a class might not be as clean or flexible as using metaclasses. Your task is to modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass so that it applies the `timing_decorator` only to methods where the decorator is explicitly specified.

**Question:** How can you modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass to ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods where it is explicitly specified, such as by using a custom attribute or annotation?

A) By checking for a specific attribute or annotation on each method during the metaclass's `__new__` method
B) By dynamically adding the decorator to methods at runtime within the class definition
C) By overriding the `__getattribute__` method of the metaclass to apply the decorator conditionally
D) By using a custom decorator that checks for its application within the metaclass
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER]
A) By checking for a specific attribute or annotation on each method during the metaclass's `__new__` method

Explanation:
To ensure that the `timing_decorator` is applied only to methods where it is explicitly specified, you can modify the `TimeMeasuringMeta` metaclass by adding logic in its `__new__` method to check for a specific attribute or annotation on each method. If this attribute or annotation is present, apply the decorator; otherwise, leave the method unchanged. This approach allows for fine-grained control over which methods are decorated and can be easily extended to accommodate different ways of specifying that a method should be timed.
