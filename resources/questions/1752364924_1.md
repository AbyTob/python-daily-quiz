    ## Question
    Part 1 (Question):
Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to ensure all instances of a class have a unique attribute:

```python
class UniqueMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=UniqueMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass(10)
obj2 = MyClass(20)

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Output: True
print(obj1.value, obj2.value)  # Output: 10 20
```

Which of the following statements about the code above is correct?

A) The `UniqueMeta` metaclass ensures that all instances of `MyClass` are unique based on their class type.
B) The `__call__` method in `UniqueMeta` checks if an instance already exists and returns it if it does, ensuring uniqueness.
C) This pattern can be used to create a pool of objects where each object is uniquely identified by its class.
D) The `obj1.value` attribute will always return the value of the last created instance.
    
    ## Answer
    Part 2 (Answer):
B) The `__call__` method in `UniqueMeta` checks if an instance already exists and returns it if it does, ensuring uniqueness.

Explanation:
The code defines a metaclass `UniqueMeta` that overrides the `__call__` method. This method is responsible for creating new instances of classes. If an instance of a class already exists in `_instances`, it returns that instance instead of creating a new one. Therefore, all instances of `MyClass` are indeed unique based on their class type. Option A is incorrect because it suggests uniqueness based on the object's identity rather than its class. Option C is not directly supported by this pattern, as it only ensures per-class uniqueness. Option D is false because `obj1.value` will return the value of the first instance created, not the last one.
