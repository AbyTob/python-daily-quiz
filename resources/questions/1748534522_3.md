    **Part 1: Question**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, delay):
        self.delay = delay
    
    def __call__(self, coro):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            await asyncio.sleep(self.delay)
            return await coro(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

@AsyncTimer(2)
async def slow_task():
    print("Task started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Task finished")

async def main():
    await slow_task()
    print("Main function completed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

What will be the output of this script when run?

A) Task started  
   Task finished  
   Main function completed

B) Task started  
   Main function completed  
   Task finished  

C) Task started  
   Task finished after 2 seconds  
   Main function completed

D) Task started  
   Task finished after 3 seconds  
   Main function completed

**Part 2: Answer**

A) Task started  
   Task finished  
   Main function completed

**Explanation:** 

The `AsyncTimer` class is a decorator that delays the execution of any coroutine it decorates by the specified delay. In this case, `@AsyncTimer(2)` means that any coroutine passed to it will have its execution delayed by 2 seconds before proceeding.

When you call `await slow_task()` in the `main` function, `slow_task` is decorated with `AsyncTimer(2)`. This means that when `slow_task` is called, it first waits for 2 seconds (due to the decorator), and then proceeds with its original execution. The output will therefore be:

1. "Task started" (immediately)
2. Task finishes after an additional 2 seconds ("Task finished")
3. Then, after another second (total of 3 seconds), "Main function completed"

So, option A is the correct answer as it matches the described behavior.
