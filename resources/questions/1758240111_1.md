    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimerClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.start_time = None
    
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Executing block took {end_time - self.start_time:.4f} seconds.")
        return False

@timer
def my_function():
    time.sleep(1)

with TimerClass() as tc:
    my_function()
```

Which of the following statements about this code is true?

A) The `timer` decorator and the `TimerClass` context manager will both correctly measure the execution time of `my_function`.
B) Only the `TimerClass` context manager will correctly measure the execution time.
C) Only the `timer` decorator will correctly measure the execution time.
D) Neither the `timer` decorator nor the `TimerClass` context manager will correctly measure the execution time.
    
    ## Answer
    [C] Only the `timer` decorator will correctly measure the execution time.

Explanation: The `TimerClass` context manager measures the time within its block, but it does not account for the time taken by `my_function` because the time is captured before `my_function` even starts executing. On the other hand, the `timer` decorator wraps the function call and accurately measures the total execution time of the function itself, including any time spent in nested functions or operations within `my_function`.
