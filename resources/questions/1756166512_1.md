    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class MyClass(metaclass=Singleton):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Usage
obj1 = MyClass(10)
obj2 = MyClass(20)

print(obj1 is obj2)  # Output: ?
print(obj1.value, obj2.value)  # Output: ?
```

What will be the output of this code?

A) `True`, `10`
B) `True`, `20`
C) `False`, `10`
D) `False`, `20`

[ANSWER]
A) `True`, `10`

Explanation:
The Singleton metaclass is used to ensure that only one instance of `MyClass` can be created, no matter how many times it is instantiated. In the given code, when `obj1 = MyClass(10)` and `obj2 = MyClass(20)` are executed, the metaclass's `__call__` method checks if an instance already exists for the class `MyClass`. Since it does not, it creates a new instance with the value `10` and stores it in `_instances`. When `obj2 = MyClass(20)` is executed, the same instance (`obj1`) is returned from `_instances`, ensuring that both `obj1` and `obj2` refer to the same object. Therefore, `obj1 is obj2` evaluates to `True`, and both `obj1.value` and `obj2.value` are `10`.
