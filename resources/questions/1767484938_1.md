    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def manage_resources(a, b):
    print(f"Acquiring resources: {a}, {b}")
    try:
        yield a, b
    finally:
        print(f"Releasing resources: {a}, {b}")

with manage_resources(10, 20) as (x, y):
    print(x + y)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the behavior and output of this code?

A. The context manager will not release any resources because it does not use `finally`.
B. When the context is exited, an exception will be raised.
C. The code will output "Acquiring resources: 10, 20", "30", and "Releasing resources: 10, 20".
D. The context manager will only print the acquisition message and then fail to yield.
    
    ## Answer
    C. The code will output "Acquiring resources: 10, 20", "30", and "Releasing resources: 10, 20".

Explanation:
The provided code defines a context manager using Python's `contextmanager` decorator. When the `with` statement is executed, it automatically handles the acquisition and release of resources by calling the `__enter__` (automatically) and `__exit__` methods when exiting the block.

In this case, since we are not explicitly implementing these methods in the generator function, Python's context manager implementation takes care of the necessary steps:
- The `yield` statement is used to return the resources for use within the `with` block.
- When the block exits (either normally or with an exception), Python calls the `__exit__` method to clean up, which in our custom context manager is handled by the `finally` block.

Thus, when the code runs:
1. It prints "Acquiring resources: 10, 20".
2. It then calculates and prints `x + y = 30`.
3. Finally, it prints "Releasing resources: 10, 20" as the context is exited.
