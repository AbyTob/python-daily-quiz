    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet that uses a metaclass to add a method dynamically to all classes that inherit from `BaseClass`. Your task is to understand how this metaclass works and what its primary purpose is.

```python
# Define a metaclass that adds a method to all subclasses of BaseClass
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Add a new method 'method_added_by_metaclass' to the class dictionary
        dct['method_added_by_metaclass'] = lambda self: "Method added!"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Define a base class using the metaclass
class BaseClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Subclass of BaseClass
class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    pass

# Create an instance of DerivedClass and call the dynamically added method
derived_instance = DerivedClass()
print(derived_instance.method_added_by_metaclass())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding the use of this metaclass?

A) The metaclass adds a method to `BaseClass`, which then all subclasses can access.

B) The metaclass modifies the behavior of `DerivedClass` directly.

C) The metaclass changes how instances of `DerivedClass` are created.

D) The metaclass allows for runtime manipulation of class attributes but does not affect instance creation.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

A) The metaclass adds a method to `BaseClass`, which then all subclasses can access.

Explanation: In the provided code, the metaclass `Meta` is used to dynamically add a method `method_added_by_metaclass` to any class that inherits from `BaseClass`. This means that every subclass of `BaseClass`, including `DerivedClass`, will have this method available. The purpose here is to extend the functionality of all subclasses without modifying each one individually, showcasing a powerful use case for metaclasses in Python.
