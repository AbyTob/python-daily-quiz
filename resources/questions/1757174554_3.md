    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

You are working on a Python project where you need to ensure that all functions in a module are correctly decorated with a custom decorator that measures the execution time of each function. The decorator should also log the name of the function and its execution time.

To achieve this, you decide to use a metaclass to automatically apply the decorator to all methods defined within any class that inherits from a base class named `TimedClass`.

Here is an example of how you might implement this:

```python
import time

def timed_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run.")
        return result
    return wrapper

class TimedClassMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value):
                dct[attr_name] = timed_decorator(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class TimedClass(metaclass=TimedClassMeta):
    def method1(self):
        time.sleep(0.5)

    def method2(self):
        time.sleep(1.0)
```

However, when you run the following code:

```python
def main():
    instance = TimedClass()
    instance.method1()
    instance.method2()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You notice that the decorator does not seem to be applied correctly. The `method1` and `method2` are not being decorated.

**Question:** What is likely going wrong with the implementation of the `TimedClassMeta` metaclass? 

A) The metaclass is not properly defining new attributes in the class dictionary.  
B) The `timed_decorator` function does not correctly apply to methods that are added dynamically after the class is created.  
C) The metaclass is being overridden by another class definition elsewhere in your codebase, causing it to be ignored.  
D) The decorator is not handling asynchronous functions (coroutines).

**Part 2 (Answer):**

The correct answer is A) The metaclass is not properly defining new attributes in the class dictionary.

Explanation: When a method is added dynamically to a class after its creation, the `__new__` method of the metaclass will not be called again. This means that any modifications made to the class dictionary within the `__new__` method are only applied to methods defined at the time of the class definition. Any methods added later do not automatically pass through the metaclass and thus are not decorated.

To fix this issue, you would need to ensure that the `TimedClassMeta` metaclass handles dynamic method addition or consider using a different approach to apply decorators dynamically across an entire module rather than relying on a metaclass.
