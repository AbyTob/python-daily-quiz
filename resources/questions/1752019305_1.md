    ## Question
    [QUESTION]
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to modify class attributes dynamically. The goal is to create a new class `EnhancedClass` that, when instantiated, outputs "Hello, Enhanced!" before calling its original constructor.

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: print("Hello, Enhanced!")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class OriginalClass(metaclass=Meta):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        pass

# Your task is to create an instance of `EnhancedClass` and verify that it outputs "Hello, Enhanced!" when instantiated.
    
    ## Answer
    [A] 
```python
instance = OriginalClass()
instance.greet()  # This will not print anything because `greet` is not part of `OriginalClass`.
```

[B] 
```python
class EnhancedClass(OriginalClass):
    pass

instance = EnhancedClass()
instance.greet()  # This will output "Hello, Enhanced!"
```

[C] 
```python
class ExtendedMeta(Meta):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        return type(name, bases, dct)

class EnhancedClass(OriginalClass, metaclass=ExtendedMeta):
    pass

instance = EnhancedClass()
instance.greet()  # This will not output "Hello, Enhanced!" because `greet` is not part of `EnhancedClass`.
```

[D] 
```python
instance = OriginalClass()
print("Hello, Enhanced!")  # This will not use metaclass functionality and directly print the string.
```

[ANSWER]
B
