    [QUESTION]
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import time

class TimingDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = await self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{self.func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to run.")
        return result

@TimingDecorator
async def async_task(n):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an asynchronous operation
    return n * n

async def main():
    task = async_task(5)
    print(await task)

# Run the main function using asyncio.run()
asyncio.run(main())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A. The `TimingDecorator` does not support asynchronous functions.

B. When `main()` is called, it will block for 1 second before printing the result.

C. The `async_task` function will complete its execution in less than 0.5 seconds when run by itself.

D. The `TimingDecorator` can be used to measure both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
    
    ## Answer
    [D] The `TimingDecorator` can be used to measure both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
