    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following Python code that uses a metaclass to enhance class behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['hello'] = lambda self: "Hello from {}".format(name)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

my_instance = MyClass()
print(my_instance.hello())
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `hello` method is defined in the `MyClass` and can be accessed directly from instances.
B) The metaclass `Meta` does not affect the behavior of `MyClass`.
C) The `my_instance` will raise an AttributeError when trying to access `hello()`.
D) The metaclass `Meta` dynamically adds a `goodbye` method to all classes that use it.
    
    ## Answer
    A) The `hello` method is defined in the `MyClass` and can be accessed directly from instances.

**Explanation:** In this example, the metaclass `Meta` modifies the dictionary of any class that uses it. It adds a new key-value pair `'hello': lambda self: "Hello from {}".format(name)` to the dictionary. This means that whenever an instance of `MyClass` is created, it will have a `hello` method that returns a greeting string based on the class name. Therefore, calling `my_instance.hello()` correctly executes and prints "Hello from MyClass".
