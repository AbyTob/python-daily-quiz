    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
You are tasked with creating a caching mechanism that can be applied to any function to store the results of previous computations. This caching mechanism should support both synchronous and asynchronous functions, ensuring efficient use of resources without duplicating computation. Here is a simplified version of how such a caching system might look for synchronous functions:

```python
def cache_results(func):
    cached_results = {}
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if (args, kwargs) not in cached_results:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            cached_results[(args, kwargs)] = result
        return cached_results[(args, kwargs)]
    return wrapper

@cache_results
def sync_func(x):
    print(f"Computing {x}")
    return x * 2
```

For an asynchronous function, we need to adapt the caching mechanism. Here is a proposed solution:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_cache_results(func):
    cached_results = {}
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if (args, kwargs) not in cached_results:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            cached_results[(args, kwargs)] = result
        return cached_results[(args, kwargs)]
    return wrapper

@async_cache_results
async def async_func(x):
    print(f"Computing {x}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an I/O operation
    return x * 3
```

Now, let's test our caching mechanisms:

```python
import time

# Testing synchronous function
start = time.time()
print(sync_func(5))  # Should compute and print 10
time.sleep(1)
print(sync_func(5))  # Should not recompute, just return the cached result
end = time.time()
print(f"Synchronous caching took {end - start} seconds")

# Testing asynchronous function
async def test_async():
    start = time.time()
    await async_func(5)  # Should compute and print 15
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    await async_func(5)  # Should not recompute, just return the cached result
    end = time.time()
    print(f"Asynchronous caching took {end - start} seconds")

asyncio.run(test_async())
```

Which of the following statements correctly describes the functionality and limitations of this caching mechanism?

A. The caching mechanism works for both synchronous and asynchronous functions, and it significantly speeds up computation by avoiding redundant calculations.
B. The caching mechanism does not work with asynchronous functions because asyncio's event loop is needed to handle await expressions, which are not supported outside of an async function.
C. The caching mechanism correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions but may consume more memory due to storing results in a dictionary that grows indefinitely.
D. The caching mechanism is flawed because it does not properly invalidate cache entries when inputs change, leading to incorrect results.
    
    ## Answer
    [ANSWER] C. The caching mechanism correctly handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions but may consume more memory due to storing results in a dictionary that grows indefinitely.

Explanation: This statement accurately describes the functionality of the caching mechanisms provided for both synchronous and asynchronous functions. However, it is important to note that using a dictionary for caching can lead to indefinite growth if not properly managed, which could be a limitation depending on the use case. The other options either misstate the capabilities or limitations of the caching mechanism without considering these details.
