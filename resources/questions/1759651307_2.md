    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**
Consider the following Python code:

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncTimer:
    def __init__(self, duration):
        self.duration = duration

    async def run(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(self.duration)
        print(f"Timer completed after {self.duration} seconds")

async def main():
    timers = [AsyncTimer(i) for i in range(1, 4)]
    
    tasks = [timer.run() for timer in timers]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    asyncio.run(main())
    print(f"Total execution time: {time.time() - start_time} seconds")
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The timers will run concurrently, and the total execution time will be approximately 3 seconds.

B) The timers will run sequentially, and the total execution time will be approximately 3 seconds.

C) The timers will run concurrently, but the total execution time will be greater than 3 seconds due to overhead.

D) The timers will run sequentially, but the total execution time will be less than 1 second due to optimization.

**Part 2 (Answer):**
A) The timers will run concurrently, and the total execution time will be approximately 3 seconds.

Explanation: This code creates three `AsyncTimer` instances that are started using asyncio.gather(), which runs them concurrently. Since each timer waits for a sleep period equal to its duration, the total execution time is the maximum of these durations, which is 1 second, not 3 seconds. Therefore, all timers run concurrently, and the total execution time will be approximately 3 seconds.
