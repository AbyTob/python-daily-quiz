# Python Quiz Question
    
    ## Question
    **Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code that uses decorators and metaclasses:

```python
# Define a decorator function
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Define a metaclass that applies the decorator to all methods of the class
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name in dct:
            if callable(dct[attr_name]):
                dct[attr_name] = my_decorator(dct[attr_name])
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Apply the metaclass to a class
class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    def method1(self):
        print("Method 1 called")
    
    def method2(self):
        print("Method 2 called")

# Create an instance of MyClass and call its methods
obj = MyClass()
obj.method1()
obj.method2()
```

Which of the following statements is true about this code?  
A) When `method1` is called, it will not be decorated.  
B) The `my_decorator` function applies to all methods in `MyClass`.  
C) `MyMeta` only applies to `MyClass` and not its subclasses.  
D) Calling `obj.method1()` will not print anything due to an error.
    
    ## Answer
    **Part 2 (Answer):**

B) The `my_decorator` function applies to all methods in `MyClass`.

Explanation:
- The metaclass `MyMeta` is applied to `MyClass`, and it dynamically decorates every callable attribute within `MyClass` with the `my_decorator`. This means that both `method1` and `method2` will be wrapped by the `my_decorator` before they are added to the class.
- When an instance of `MyClass` is created and its methods are called, the decorator's behavior (printing messages before and after the method execution) will be triggered for all callable attributes of `MyClass`.
