**Part 1 (Question):**

Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time of {self.func.__name__}: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result

@Timer
def compute_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n))

# Usage
result = compute_sum(1000000)
```

Which of the following statements is true regarding this code?

A) The `Timer` class is a context manager.
B) The `compute_sum` function will be executed without any output.
C) The `Timer` class can be used as both a decorator and a metaclass.
D) The execution time of `compute_sum` will be printed to the console when called.

**Part 2 (Answer):**

**
    
    ## Answer
    ** D

**Detailed Explanation:**

The correct answer is D. Let's break down why:

- A) The `Timer` class is not a context manager. It defines a `__call__` method, which makes it an callable object rather than a context manager. Context managers use `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.

- B) This statement is incorrect because the execution time of `compute_sum` will be printed to the console when called, as demonstrated by the code.

- C) The `Timer` class can only be used as a decorator. It does not have any attributes or behaviors that would make it suitable for use as a metaclass.

- D) This statement is true. When you call `compute_sum(1000000)`, the `Timer` decorator is invoked, which measures and prints the execution time of the function before returning its result.

Thus, option D correctly describes the behavior of the provided code snippet when using the `Timer` class as a decorator.
