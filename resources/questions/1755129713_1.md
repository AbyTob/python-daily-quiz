    ## Question
    [QUESTION]  
Consider the following code snippet that uses a metaclass to enhance class behavior:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print("Creating class:", name)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Creating an instance of MyClass
my_instance = MyClass()
```

When you run the code, it prints "Creating class: MyClass". Now, modify `MyClass` so that it also adds a method `greet` to any subclass when created using this metaclass. The method should print "Hello from MyClass" whenever called.

A) Modify `Meta.__new__()` to add the method after creating the class  
B) Use a descriptor to dynamically add the method  
C) Override `MyClass.__init_subclass__()` to add the method in subclasses  
D) None of the above
    
    ## Answer
    A) Modify `Meta.__new__()` to add the method after creating the class  

Explanation: The correct answer is A. You need to modify the metaclass's `__new__` method to include the additional behavior (adding a new method `greet`). Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print("Creating class:", name)
        # Add greet method dynamically
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: "Hello from MyClass"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Creating an instance of MyClass and calling greet
my_instance = MyClass()
print(my_instance.greet())
```

When you run this modified code, it will print both "Creating class: MyClass" followed by "Hello from MyClass". This demonstrates how metaclasses can be used to dynamically alter class behavior.
